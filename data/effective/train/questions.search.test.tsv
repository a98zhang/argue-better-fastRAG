0	I also would know that it's not a face of the pharoah because the text says that it's a  huge rock formation . 
1	Finally, Despite the chanlleges and dangers they are all striving to meet the challenge. 
2	It does not let us the people choose. The Electoral Colledge baseecely sees that the citizens of our contrys opions do not matter. They are saying that the Electoral Colledges votes matter the most those are the only once we are worrying about. But thats not true our opion does matter, we are what make up this amazing cuntry not just the Electoral Colledge. 
3	if we adopt the popular vote system, what would happen if only white and black people could vote or only white men. 
4	In conclusion if we could possibly bulid something to survive venus we could find some amazing things like if it ever ahad water and find maybe remains of past forms of life. 
5	This technology could observe how our face is formed in the future.  
6	The third and final reason for the abolishment of the EC is simple. The votes NEVER count, like ever. 
7	It doesn't even take that long to do some sort of service.

11	 While looking in the mirror   By looking in the mirror can't really explain or say what's are emotion are becuase mirror don't speak and it doens't tell your emotions. People use mirro just becuase they want to see what's on their face or if it's dirty or what, how they look before they go somewhere. Mirror just copying what were doing in front of the mirror like if you start talking ofcorse your twin face in the mirror also gonna start talking too,becuase mirror is just a piece of a glass that can't describe what's people's emotion. Mirror can copy what were doing but can't say what are emotion or feeling. 
12	The electoral college is a process, not a place. The electoral college process consists of the selection of the electors. The electoral college consists of 538 electors. In the 23 Amendment of the constitution, the district of columbia is allocated 3 electors and treated  like a state for purposes of the electoral college. For this reason, in the following discussion, the word  state  also refers to the district of columbia. Next, each canidate running for president in your state has his or her own group of electors.  The electors are generally chosen by the candidate's political party,but state laws vary on how the electors are selected and what their responsibilities are.  The president election is held every four years on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. Also, most states have a  winner-take-all  system that awards all electors to the winning presidential canidate . However, Maine and Nebraska each have a variation of  proportion representation .  Abolishing the electoral college! But don't worry they're not alone; according to a Gallup poll in 2000, taken shortly after Al Gore.  Thanks to the quirks of the electoral college, which won the popular vote but lost the presidency, over 60 percent of voterswould prefer a direct election to the kind we have now.  Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president.  You might not know this so if you dont here is something very interesting for you to know. Who are the electors? Well they can be snoyone not holding public office. Here's something eles you might know, Who picks the electors in the first place? well here's the answer it depends on the state. The single best argument against the electoral college is what we might call the disaster factor.  The American people should consider themselces lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century; the system allows for must more. consider that state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors, and thats those electors could always defy the will of the people. Black in 1960.  Perhaps most worrying is the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote. In that case, the election would be thrown to the hose of representatives, where state deegations vote on the president. 
13	but I do know that it was not made by aliens. 
14	and if they want to decide if they want to have their cell phones on in class is not going to be better for the teachers because they cant help the students learn and what is going on in life and what do they have to do as their assignment. they want to be texting in class and be distracted. 
15	What i can also personally add to this parrgraph is things are way more depenable and understanding and way more better and trustfull and when many people join their heads together. 
16	There's five reason to where the Electoral College should be retraining. 
17	The chose on have online course can go both way ,it depend on the on problem if most student and teacher complain about wake up to early and not having enough time to get every ready. In my opinion it depend on the situation the school is having ,if it the only way to have to have student to do their work and get everything done then go for it. There is no good or bad option for this. It's all on the situation on hand. Both thing have there goods and there bad ,but it is up for these school departments to know if it will help the student or make it worse than it was already. 
18	So in the storu it talks about going to diffrenet places in our solar system so in the story it talks about how some plants can actually hold humans in it cuase it has the same things this planet has but not all of them. So they where talking about a planet in particular venus a planet right next to us we can have a spaceship go there. they talk about some of venus things like how hot it is the planet reaches 800 degrees. 
19	technoloy floods our brain, meaning there is so many inventions it just brainwashes us. We can use photo I.D. now for getting on to our phone. There are mixed emotions when we do show our personality, the techonolgy recognizes it. So we can change everything so someone says,  the facial expressions for each emotion are universal,  observes Dr. Huang. The mona lisa drawing is suppose to bring a smile to everyones face.  So people are still wandering what the mona lisa represents, the mona lisa represents art and beauty. There is a song called mona lisa, and its kinda a love song, saying your my mona lisa baby. So i think the whole idea of this song is to show that the mona lisa is a thing of beauty it represnts more than just beauty.  What else does it represent, well does your expression in the mirror suggest an emotion? Do you feel mad or sad. if you felt sad and you were crying and you went to the mirror and looked in the mirror, what would you see in yourself because down deep inside if thing yuo incredibly hurt. Can your lab partner recgonize which emotion you are doing? yes there is a doctor for that. there are so many emotions you dint even know throughout the day. 
20	Let me tell you the things that would change of limiting car usage. 
21	Because whats the point of all of our parents and alot of other adults of voting if we can't even get what we want but no it's all up to the electors and congress, ect. like for real what is the point in voting if it isn't a fair shot. 
22	i agree 
23	The consequences should be very big for being on a cell phone or let alone bringing a cell phone to school. Students should at least have a detention or even an in school suspension. Students need to know their boundaries and what happens when they cross them. Discipline is a great way to turn students off their cell phones 
24	like the one we have today. 
25	They are trying to said that they want to invent a computer that knows when are you happy and when you are sad or angry and other caind of emottions.  each they there are trying to have new tecnology and new stuff they have to see whats goin on in that they have to do what they have to do.  Other peopl;e dont like to see other people expressions because they get enoy from seeintg them.  They are seeing video games and trying to see what can they do to modofy them . 
26	Some people thinks its funny to watch other contenets to bein war. 
27	I disagree.  
28	This painting is was made a long time ago. Many people found this painting weird because, back then there wasn't a lot of people happy, also poor. So when you see this picture this girl is happy and looks like she has nice cloths on. People took this picutre into inspiration. And brought a lot to the picture. 
29	My therd reasion is if you make it be useable on animals then we can uncover a lot of mysteryes 
30	to help with all the dier need that the world has to offer for the Electoral College just dont get rid of it for no reason you need to have a really great suggestion to remove it out of the system. 
31	The electoral college requires a presidential candidate to be choosen. 
32	Finally I think If we could choose the president it would be better becuse the people would get what they want 
33	I don't believe a technology can identify human emotions 
34	when they lying too, becuase some students dont like to show or describe how they feel. not just on students we should use it on we should use it on friends and family too. we need to know how to help people if they upstet to cheer them up, or if there happy we need to know what made them happy. 
35	but that is an opion.  Their are meany rational reasons about why the Electoral College is benificaial rather then destructive. 
36	if the NASA cameras did not see any people/aliens. On that fact if NASA did see any aliens on Mars they would have kept it top secret and wold have not showed the images to the world 
37	Therefore, I agree with what the passage is saying because it says ''The Electoral College consists of 538 electors. A majority of 270 electors votes is required to elect the President. Your state's entitles allotment of electors equals the nu,ber of memebers in its Congressional delegation: one for each member in the House of Representatives plus two for your Senators.... 
38	According to paragraph three of source one , the Electoral College consist of five hundred and thirty-eight electors . A canidate has to earn two hundred and seventy of those votes . 
39	Venus is our sister planet. Some call us twins because of the sizes we both have. But, Venus is the closest to the sun like Mercury is the first panet next to the sun. So Venus is the warmer part of our sisterhood, and Earth are the cold part of our sisterhood. It's sort of like Venus is Anna because of her warm personality. And earth is like Elsa, because of her frozen powers, so she is extremely cold when it comes down to things. Earth at the moment is like Elsa because of its winter landish time of the year. 
40	 Evening Star  this article state in, venus is one of the brightest points of light in the night sky,making it simple for even an amateur stargazer to spot.   Twin  this article state in, venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size, and occasionally the closest in distance too.   The venus blanked.  The article state in the venus atmospere have almost of 97 percent of carbon dioxide.   Venus surface.  the article state on the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greateer than what we experience on our own planet.  The article essay, thia articlo explain about  The challenge of Exploring Venus   venus is a planet nd look like a star because brightes points of light in the nigth sky, and tambien is a  twin  is the earth's twin, venus is it really closest at the eart and tambien look similar in the size and in the density, tambien look are similsr in the distance.         
41	In source 2: the indefensible electoral college: why even the besy-laid defenses of the system are wrong states  because of the winner take all system in each state, candidates dont spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the 'swing' states.  
42	This 'Face' isn't a landform, its a lifeform. 
43	After you ask the people you wanted to ask for advice, your going to have to make a decision. Before you make a decision, you are going to have to think of the consequences. Consequences are the outcomes of your choices that you decided to make. There can be good consequences and then there can be bad ones. The bad consequences depend on the situation that you are going to be in or is already there. You have to think,  If I do that what is going to happen. Is it positive or is it going to be negative.  Normally, people always go for the peaceful choice so their can be less problems. People also make choices everyday on what to eat, wear, and when they should do their papers. 
44	Getting more opinions can help you because it can get you more advice and by getting more advice helps the person asking know more. What does it help by asking more than one person it can get you get you more advice just in case you did not know. 
45	Venus is a very dangrus planet its ben proven, not one human has lasted more than a few hours floating above the fray,its been more than three decades since a space ship has tuched venus but 
46	I think it is a good thing then all you will have to do is say to your computers how do i feel today it will say to you 
47	If you don't want to make all the kids in the school do community service, then i think you should put up a sign up sheet for students who want to so they can sign up, and have a day or two every week were they leave school for a couple hours to go do some community service with some teachers that volunteers also.  
48	NASA is working on a lot of different approaches on how to last a while or have a good landing on Venus. 
49	I have done research 
50	I hear you are trying to make a decision on whether all students should be required to perform community service. 
51	Its like the man it the moon it is just a landscape it is nothing big at all. By saying that it is an alien people today would probally believe that it is true they would go crazy. 
52	No one should force you too do anything that is outside of your comfort zone except your parents, they can force you to do anything they need you too do. Other than your parents and family members,no one should even think about forcing you to do something because that is just a horrible thing to do. unless they have permission from your parents, I don't think that they should be able to tell you that you can or can't do extracurricular activities because that would'nt be fair to the people who actually enjoy them. As for the rest of us, we'll be fine her as long as we don't have to do any pointless extracurricular activities. So to answer the question, would you like to have to do an extracurricular, No! not at all, but some people might 
53	we should be able to pick and choose what's in our schools 
54	FACS can classify six basic emotions happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness just by seeing the the movements of your facial muscles. 
55	This way it will teach the students that they shouldn't litter and that it is bad, and damages a lot of our property and if they do it they will have to pay for what they have done and suffer a big punishment. For example if someone throws a drink bottle on the ground it is there responsibility and they should clean it up. 
56	If the principle were to make this rule then everyone wouldnt be as lazy. 
57	A magority of 270 elctors votes are reqiured. 3 Electors and treated like a state of purpose. Running for president has their own group  of elcetors. Help choose the states electors when you vote for canidate. Governer prepares a Certificate of Ascertanaiment. 
58	Everybody is different most people that read somebody's emotion is because there a love one or a every good friend and they can read your emotion. There is just other people that don't care. Most people should be able to see if your angry, sad or happy. Those emotions are easy to see, kids show it all the time even when there not feeling so good. 
59	You are helping them by choosing wich president will help them and thier family have a better life. The citizens know what they need, they know if Obama is going to help them or not. They know who to vote for because they are providing what they need to live good life. If more citizens vote ofr one president then another, gues what? You just helped more then half of the us a citizens because they knew wich president helped them more. The trouble is out here and you can only fix it with us.  
60	In 1976 Viking 1 took a photo of formations on mars. The picture looked like a face so the people of the world thought oh my god. Aliens invaded mars and they will invade us run 
61	I think there is some good things about the Electroal College but some things I do not agree 
62	There are advantages to this way of life 
63	but if this is not a face what is it? That's what your thiniking right. We had to find out 
64	The author has different details and has found them. 
65	because you are adding and subtracting only 538 people, but if you are counting from popular votes you would have to add up millions and billions of votes that would be miscounted. If it's miscounted the wrong person could be elected for president.            
66	As you can see cell phones are 
67	And yet, it is still how president after preseident is put into the Oval Office- sometimes wrongly as explained above. 
68	How would they survive and humans can not. In paragraph nine it discribes how hard it was to even get a picture of this face. If its very hard to get a good glimpse of this image. Its going to be struggle to live and be active on Mars as well. This has to be a natural landform that happens to looks like a face. If someone really did this, they would want credit and all the fame for all their hard work and i think we would have spotted them all ready. 
69	It might even make some people turn against their country, but that only goes for the people who are really into politics and voting and things of that nature. People say you can't complain if you don't vote, but if they take that perivlage away, I'm sure you'll be hearing even more complaining than if people have the right to vote, but even so, this up and coming generation isn't really into voting anyways, but it should be avalable regardless. 
70	Other teenagers might think that it is all fun and games 
71	This a one time offer. You don't know how long this opperation will be running. 
72	First off, Mona Lisa is mostly always happy and she wanted to come up with a way to see if a lot of school students are happy or just faking there happiniss and hiding there real emotions. 
73	Students should have the same rights as teachers or any adults. The constitution says that all people are created equal. That should give students the right to bring cell phones to school 
74	i mean yes theres alot of bandwagon fans and people who really have no idea of whats going on in their country 
75	It could be possible but we will have to wait to find out. 
76	In the begin in the story it talks about how she had 83 percent happy and 9 percent digusted smile and 6 percent fearful and 2 percent angry. And that her science teacher had graded her latest lab assignment. And that mona lisa at least according some new computer of showing her emotions. 
77	That cannot be true becasue if the aliens were hidden we would not have such a great picture of the faces. That completly shows that there is proof that this face is just a natural landform. 
78	No ones life should have to be put on the line to explore a diffrent planet. I personally think its a great idea. As said in the passage  Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation.          
79	You have the best food out there too 
80	If the eclectoral college leads to a tie our votes become the tie braker but that method has never been use so why are we even voting? 
81	America was made to give people freedom, so people being able to pick the pesident is a big part of our freedom, and taking that away leaves us with not as much say in big desions such as a presidental election. The people that would probably complain the most is older people because they are use to being able to vote, and taking that away would get them angry I'm sure, and the people complain louder than they do praise. 
82	why i think that we should keep it how it is because is concissed of it concissed of 538 electors and the majority of 270 elector votes is required to elect the president. your state is required to allotment of the electors to equal the number od members in its Congerssional delgation. Under the 23 Amendment the district of columbia is allocated 3 electors. each canidate running for state has the there own group of electors. Electors are genarall choosen by the politial party. you or who ever is voteing helps choose your states electors when you vote. but when you vote for your candidate you ae actually voting for you candidates electors. After the electon there is a Certificate of Ascertainment perpared by the governor listing all of the canidates who ran for President along with the hname sod their electors. 
83	if we go to the second planet from the sun the gravity would be more tense and would have different affects on humans. the gravity on venus would pull them down more than earth because it is closer to the sun by two planets away. but we also need to think about the air and the atmosphere because if we just go there then we might die. the air on venus is un supportive to humans and the water is not there or it might be a type of water that if you drink it it will kill you. the storms on venus are acid storms, the rain is acid. so i think the only reason why the author is saying that venus is a challenge is because not only the facts above. but also that the fact is that on the serface, temperetures average over 800 degrees fahrenheit. and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we humans experience on earth. so he also might be saying that it might be a challenge because if we take a rocket, it might be torn apart if we dont have the right mesurements. 
84	The NASA has only one particularly compeliing to study whats beyond what people dont see or dont know for hummans can travel to other plants 
85	People don't always think that creations like that can be made by a natural landform 
86	Another quote from paragraph one is ¨However, this nickname is misleding since Venus is actually a planet. In our solar system, Venus is the second planet from our sun¨. This quote means that even though Venus looks like a star because it extremely bright, and shows off an extreme amout of light it is a planet. Many people mistake Venus as a star but once they find out it is a planet they are amazed because of the brightness of it 
87	There are so many positive things on why to keep the electoral process and I also make room for the errors of it so dont think im on a one man train,because im not 
88	i would never go and get a computer to help me with my problems because they dont know everything plus why would you want it in the classroom anyway , someone can come steal it or anything you never now a days people is doing all types of stuff 
89	They try to find,(are  SUPPOSED  ) to find a non decided not on any side representative for that state. But that plan has failed. 
90	but when you in the group your work is more ease for you because you have other peoples and thye help you in thing a goods ideas and they can make a good work if you work only you need more time for doing you work and some times we can chese a good things and some times we need others opinions the other peoples. 
91	Can we calculate our emotions like math? Even we don't use this kind of techonology we can tell other people emotions by looking at their face. If we known all about what other people think about us, it didn't good for all of us.  
92	After this decision starts getting enforced, every student will be able to find something they like!  
93	The Electoral College is a process where selected elector come together and vote for President and Vice President. It consist of 538 electors and majority vote (270) is required to elect the presient 
94	Venus has the hottest surface tempature of any planet in our solar system, though Mercury is closer to our sun. Beyond high pressure and heat, Venusian geology and weather present additional impediments like erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning strikes to probes seeking land on it's surface. If our sister planet is so inhospitable, why are scientists even discussing further visits to its surface? Astronmers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system. Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life. Today, Venus still has some features that are analogous to those on Earth. The planet has a surface of a rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains and craters. 
95	If the advocates of this position is correct in arguing that the Electoral College method is not democratic in a modern sense . It is the electers who elect the president, not the people . It is entirely possible that the winner of the electoral vote will not win the national popular vote. yet this has happened very rarely when Gore had more popular votes then Bush . It can be argued that the Electoral college method of selecting the president may turn off selecting the president may turn off potential voters for a canadidate who has no hope of carrying their state . And not having everyone vote mite throw things off too. but of courseno voters  vote swings a national election, and in spite of that about one -half the eligible American population did vote in 2012 's election. 
96	It good to play do activiy but it a lot thing to do outside have fun or some we young sports is fun to but no one want to be and a hot gym half of the day out of energy when you get home you get home you going want to go to bed going to want to eat and sleep that it now activty a lot eat and sleep that it now activty a lot of work some don't like now who want sit after scool to do some work  
97	Most of the time electoral college makes mistakes on who they pick. 
98	In the text it says that  NASA possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientist to float above the fray.  It also says that   not a single spaceship has toched down on venus in more then three decases. No spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours and no one had ever been there.  You could be the first one to land on Venus. This proves that since it is a dangers planet it would still be worthy seeing it. Now, lets talk about why it wouldn't be worthy seeing it. 
99	It's illegal to drive with a phone and its multiple why you can't drive without a phone 
100	I think we should explore venus because venus might have the material that earth has not 
101	So don't force us to do something we don't want to do, or buy something we don't want to buy, or force us to not buy something so we eat with dirty dishes.  
102	that why Venus is whorthy pursuit despite the dangers presents. 
103	When you are using your cell phone while driving, you're doing all three types which are manual, visual, and cognitive. 
104	you wont have to worry about the hassle of having to call parents to come pick up the phone. 
105	This policy may work so students can bring their grade up and stop failing their classes. One way they can bring up their up and be able to participate in sports is by turning in there homework and completing their work in class. 
106	If the congress or whoever was to abolish the electoral congress vote I think we would see numerous of changes in our past history and our future, 
107	I really believe this change in your school's regulation could help your students develop into a fully grade A campus and be even better than before. 
108	If they every change the system to popular votes for the president it would be a honest choice 
109	I have recently read an article by the name of ¨Driverless Cars Are Coming¨, and asked my opinion. 
110	Venus's knickname is sometimes called the  Evening Star  mainly because Venus is simple to see from the distant but safe vantage point of Earth has proved a very challenging place to examine closely.  It is also called the  Evening Star  because Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size, and occasionally the closest in distance too. On Venus, the temperatures average over 800 degrees Farenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than on Earth. 
111	But I feel they should take it a little more exstreme for things like could also have audio and could really help with peoples lives. Not even the bad emotions if you are happy or exicted it can sense that and something good could happen.  
112	I hope you choose to become a seagoing cowboy and help out the people in need.             
113	*they only do it like that at some schools* 
114	luke bomberger wants to be a seagoing cowboy who rides the waves becuase he is used to riding the waves because he crossed the atlantic ocean 16 times and the pacific twice to help people affected by WW 2. he rode on a cattle boat to europe to be a sesgoing cowboy. his friend don reist is going and he knows that luke can surf. and don invited him and luke is working to jobs as a bank accountant and a grouchery store. so he has to decide wether he should go or he should stay at his zenith.  luke decides to go and it was 1945 in WW2 was all over europe many countries were left in ruins.  to help these countries all 44 nations joined together to form UNRRA hired seagoing cowboys such as luke luke and don signed up.  in august 1945 the two boys luke and don recived threir orders the report to new orleans. the ywo boys are doing this so they coud be a sea going cowboy.  the two boys arived august 14. the day the pacific war ended they got their seamans papers and boarded the ss charles w. rooster and they headed for greece.  the cattle boat trips were an unbeleiveable opportunity for a small town boy luke also toured china greece venice and a excavated castle. luke was at the atlantic ocean for two weeks and it took him a month t get to china. 
115	I don't think the landform is an ancient artifact or any alian artifact i just think its a normal landform that happens to look like a human or alian face. 
116	There would be multiple guesses on how her face looks. In paragraph 6, the author says,  The Mona Lisa demonstration is really intended to bring a smile to your face, while it shows just how much this computer can do.  Some people might say that she looks mostly happy, a bit disgusted, somewhat fearful, and a little angry. Or they might say all of them and more. We all have different minds, different thoughts, and a different sights at describing a picture. 
117	For one, it is the second planet closes to the sun so it would be extremely hot. Next, the air pressure would be quite hard for humans to handle as well. In the passage it states,  On the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet.  This clearly gives enough information to say that these conditions are more extreme than what any human can handle. 
118	On my opino i don't consiter them to change to poplaur voted becasue to me its nothing i agree to keeping the electoral college votes  
119	it cause many crisis to happened. 
120	And others may have their opinions on this but it's ok to have your own opinion also different opinions don't hurt nobody it's just that different people believe in different things.    
121	because i don't really care about any of this. But you wanted my opinion so i gave it to you. Also I say to stick with the electoral college is because i don't care enough to give a reason to change your voting to popular vote. I don't really knoe anything about the ellectoral college or populare vot, because you passage is to boring i couldn't get through half of it. 
122	To commence the third reasoning let another question be asked: First, say for example that you work a double-shift, full-time, day and night just to keep food on your childrens' and wifes' plate, clothes on their backs, and a roof over their heads. When the bills roll in, your paycheck isn't won't arrive for weeks and you still haven't enough to pay, so you may have to work overtime if possible or pick up another job. No one gets rich off the government clearly, and yet we work so hard to just make it. Now here's the question: Doesn't it all feel worth it when the paycheck come in? Okay now for the deeper question: What is the sense or feeling you specifically get when you see you happy families' faces? Now for the point: Our work pays off. We work for the government (at least most of us does) together, whether to put bread on the table or otherwise. Now wouldnt it give us that sense of freedom that us hard workers get to make great decisions like these? It would. 
123	peoples reactions emotional expressions are different and people are different some people can have bad emotional expressions and it could be harmful, and it could be painful for others. People can have really great emotional expressions, like being happy all the time. It says in paragraph 1 that Mona Lisa is 83 percent happy, 9 percent discusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry. People can be the complete oppisate of that and it couldn't be good on other people, But people can also be like Mono Lisa and it makes the inviornment a better place knowing people are happy and not sad, discusted and angry. 
124	socializing with their peers. 
125	Like if you wanted to know how your dog or cat felt about you all you had to do was turn on the FACS and see. We could also see if lions kill becaues there mean or becaues they dont know what eals to do. Many things could be uncover thnks to FACS. 
126	Some school offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way online or video conferencing because for some students that's the best way to take their classes but for other student is not the best way because some student have to work after school and they have other responsabilities to do 
127	But over time sand bulid over it gave what it look like in 1976. In the photograph you can see that it maybe face but you can see that it can be a hill. What are the black spot in the photograph that we see here. It could be that is that can be made on mars by wnich it from by.                                      
128	it restores some of the weight that large states loses 
129	Over all i think it a good thing. They learn how to do good in school and sports and to be responsible. 
130	If a student if feeling strong emotions such as saddness or fear; they need to talk to a friend about it, someone they can trust, not a computer. 
131	having a car not only affects your daily life but allso affects your environment. 
132	NASA would be making our living situations a lot easier to handle of Venus by creating all of this new technology today in this age/era 
133	First,Professor. Thomas Huang of the beckman Institute for advanced Science at the University of Illinois working with  Professor. Nicu Sebe of the University of Amsterdam. Dr. Huang and his colleague are developing better ways for humans and computers to communicate which the proces begin when a computer constructs a 3-D computer Model of the Human face that contains all 44 major muscles in the model that must move like Human. 
134	The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational it officail !!!. Also arguments against direct elections are apurious at best. Bob dole was right:abolish the electoral college.  
135	the canidate gains no electoral votes by increasing his plurailty. that is a desirable result because a candidate with only regional appeal will umlikely succed to be a president. 
136	 People in this world always going off on what people say or showing them computers dont always be right 
137	But one the other hand, there saying that they might change it to the election of the popular votes of the president of the United States. I think they should keep using the electoral college because it actually have better benefits or outcomes because you know who you voted for and from what they told you 
138	I think of people need make manny technology because actual computers can be trick 
139	As I read more not all the people were ok with the problem 
140	according to the gallup poll in 2000, 60 precent of voters would prefer a direct election the electoral college is losing the little defenders it has and due to the spurious arguments the electoral college should be abolished 
141	GM has developed drivers seats that vibrates when the vehicle is in danger of backing into an object traffic jam assissant the car handle driving functions at the speed limit of 25 mph but special touch sensrs make sure the drivers keep hold of the wheel. the combination of all this input is necessary for the driverless car to mimic the skill of a human at the wheel.  The car read the positive and negative polarity as messages in binary code. these smart road systems worked surprisingly well, but they required massive upgrades to existing roads, something that was too expensive to be practical. 
142	Yes that's right they do have to make it to the candidate first they just can't walk up there first you got to be president by the pesident frist if you not by him or here then you messe dup for goood 
143	The people who don't like the idea usually become pessimists who hate everything, 
144	There are many veiw points of the Electoral College, but most would decied that its unfair, outdated, and irrational. The best arguments in favor of it are mostly assertions whithout much basis in reality. 
145	Secondly, the average temperatures of Venus is over 800 degrees Fahrenheit. 
146	That is the reasoning behind the fact that I agree with both sides here 
147	To them the president isn't their president. The winner/ the president gets all the awards and receive the most infromation. 
148	Why are scientist wasting their time trying to explore it and how would we know what is actually in Venus if we haven't yet explored it. 
149	lets just say u live in texas and wanted to vote for for john kerry youd vote for a slate of 34 democratic electors pledged to kerry. On the off chance that those electors won the state wide election,they would go to congress and kerry would get 34 electoral votes. Who are the electors? They can be anyone not holding public office. 
150	some scientist still today though study the plant. And trying to find a way to go there but the tests that there getting back isnt good 
151	You can work at a soup kitchen at lunch or set up fund raisers for people with special needs. 
152	Example like what happen to Colorado. It use to have a river but after years the water started to evaperate and it started forming big giant rocks 
153	Basic precepts are being adopted around the world in attempts to make suburbs more compact and more accessible to public transportation, with less space for parking. In this new approach, stores are being placed a walk away, on a main street, rather than in malls along some distant highway. 
154	And mostly because if we were to change it then the most of the former US Presidents would'nt even be President because of there rivals 
155	you have more ideas 
156	It can be good for them because they might enjoy it 
157	The gorveners and presitdent are trying to bane cars for good. 
158	Next, Authors reasoned these images would be a great way to engage Mars and the other people; it did. The  face of mars' became a huge icon for twenty five years. Soon it dtarred in films, was seen in books and magizines and most favored in grocery store lines. Photographing Cydonia beame a priorty for Nasa when MGS, Mars Global Surveyor arrived agian in September of 1997 which was a long eighteen years after. 
159	Things are changing fast we have to change with them.  This is why this technology is so valuable, we can use it in many ways even if its not important.  We can still get use out of it, so why not make it a thing? In the article it says  She is 83 percent happy, 9 percent digusted, 6 percent fearful and 2 percent angry  talking about the Mona Lisa painting.  Now you cant tell me that that is not cool at all. 
160	After Luke Bomberger graduation, he had two jobs he worked ar a grocery store and a bank. so when his friend ask him to go to europe on a cattle boat. in the passage luke said that he could not say no. It also includes that it was an opportuity of a lifetime.  In the passage i said that unrra hired  Seagoing Cowboys'' to take care of horeses, young cows, and mules that were shiped overseas. and Luke and Don sighned up. I think luke sighned up because he was helping out on his aunt farm. So he knew alot about helping with animals. 
161	This icon have became very popular. For example in pargargraph 5 its says   its starred in Hollywood Films, appeared in books, magazines, and is in radio talk shows. This shows that the icon is really popular and many people know and talk about the icon. 
162	The Popular States says that the electoral College system is out of date and lame , 
163	I think students should wait to get a cell phone because they not going to get nowhere with a cell phone but the same grade over again.  
164	However, some people think that this could be an actule human life form on Mars 
165	The new technology is very helpful showing about whats more to a picture or a frame. 
166	i mean what i can say so far about this artical yeah okay i understand where there coming from and all but its just i cant foucus on the part where i have to sit here an explain to yall that the women mona lisa demonstration is really to bring a smile to your face . The process begins whe the computer constructs3-d computers model to the faces . she also was also 83 percent happy 9 percent disgusted 6 percent fealful 2 percent angry . she was peaceful young lady to be honest . But while it shows as much as this computer can . imagine whst a computer that knows when your happy or sad . By the way making a happy face experiments also make you feel slighty happy . According to the feedback theory of emotion, moving your facial muscles not onlt the expresses emotion, btu also mau even help produce them 
167	Policy 2 is not the best choice because a lot of children are stubborn and not allowing phones to be on campus is just going to make them want to bring them even more 
168	in the article the the author said NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions o the surface of venus would allow scientitis to float above the fray. Imagine a blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the roiling venusian landscape. Ths quotes means thta venus is pursuit because is halping people wiht the electronic such as vehicule. 
169	Principal I will be part of this program and i will help those elementary school students. 
170	The reason is that the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College is because it eceeds the presidents votes. Most states have a winner take all method to figure out who represents your state. It would work but it would be very different then our old presidentual voting. 
171	the Robot can study the plant while the astromistes stay on earth and they can egt data about venus thanks to the Robot. The Author says that NASA is always inventing new ways to get information from space and plants without doing it in person. 
172	Say if i were to buy a big pizza ,and it was cut into 4 big pices and 8 small. The 8 people ate there pizza but it didnt really matter but when the the other 4 people ate there pizza it did . ok say if i weree to have a even pizza  4/4  . one half where the people and the other half was the big people in charge so u can say....no matter what the people say its only going to have like 25/100 effect.  After reading a text its says  when you vote for a presidential candidate you're actually vothing for a slate of electors' 
173	Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, the U.S Chamber of Commerce, and the AFL-CIO, in their time , agreed on? Abolishing the electoral college. Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for the slate of electors, who in turn elect the president.  Who picks the electors? It depends on the state. Sometimes state conventions, sometimes the state party's central comittee, sometimes the presidentail canidates themselves. Voters can't controls whom their electors vote for. Well not always .Voters sometimes get very confused about the votes in vote for the wrong canidate.  The best arguement against the electoral college is called Disater Factor. The Americans should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election in a century. Back in 1960, segregations in Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratics with new electors that would oppose John F. Kennedy.  The Electoral College is widely regarded as an anachronism, a non-democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be overruled by declaring the canidates who recieve the most votes. A dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is possible, it happened in 2000, but it's less likely than a dispute over popular vote.  The Electoral College requires a presidential Canidate to have trans-regional appeal. No other region ( South, Northwest, etc.) has enough electoral votes to elect a president. The winner takes all method of awarding electoral votes. The electoral College avoids the problems of elections in which no canidate recieves a majority of the votes cast. For an example, nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992 both had only a 43 percent plurality of the popular votes.           
174	Anybodyvoted on who you wanted to win it go can cheat the number of votes to change the president they are voting for. With the Electoral College you can't do that because,  once you voted who you want to win, it get sent out tothe electors. Who from that point on count how many voted for both of them and decide a winner. 
175	People can asume it is a human's face because it look likes it. Another thing is that there is human's face on it, can mean life on the planet, Mars. Also the rock or the artifact does have an Egyptian Pharoah, it could mean a human was at one point up there. It probably is possible to have civilization on Mars. 
176	I reconsider that are principal should let us eight graders bring are cell phones to school and allow us to use them at all time except during class. 
177	maby when i right this all down he will change his mind. i hope so. 
178	Under the 23rd Amendment of the Constitution, the district of Columbia is allocated 3 electors and treated like a state for purpose of the Electoral College. The electors are generally chosen by the candidates political party, but state laws vary on how the electors are selected and what their responsibilities are. The president only haves four years, it is held every four years on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. When you vote for your state they have a thing called winner-take-all system that awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate. However, Maine and Nebraska each have a variation of proportional representation. When the election is done they have a thing they do called Certificated of Ascertainment it lists all of the candidates who ran for president in your state along with the names of their respective electors. The Ascertainments are then sent to the Congress and then to the National Archives as part of the official records of the presidential election. 
179	it should be what the people feel most comfortable choosing 
180	In coclusion a computer are able to read your face. The computer are developing to a human understand themself. The first moment of your face can be good or bad. Well sametime are deficult ourself to able smeli or cry. To have affect is a great emotion to feel.      
181	The founding fathers established it in the Constitution as acompromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by popular vote of quilified citizens. Your state's entitled allotment of electors equals the number of members in its Congressional delegation, one for each member in the House of Representatives plus  two for your Senators. The presidential election is held every four years on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. You help choose your state's electors when you vote for your candidate you are actually voting for your candidate's electors. The Certificate of Ascertainment also declares the winning presidential candidate in your state and shows which electors will represent your state at the meeting of the electors in December of the election year. Your state's Certificates of Ascertainments are sent to the Congress and the National Archives as part of the official records of the presidential election. At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winner-take-all system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states the know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on thje tight  races in the  swing  sates. During the 2000 camaign, seventeen states din't see the candidates at all, inckuding Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters inn 25 of the largest media markets didn't get to see a single campaign ad. If anyone has a good argument for putting the fate of the presidency in the hands of a few swing voters in Ohio, they have yet to make it. The electoral College requires a presindential candidates to have trans-regional appeal. No region (South, Northeast, etc.) has enough electoral votes to elect a president. So a solid regional favorite, such as Rommey was in the South, has no incentive to campaing heavily in those states, for he gains no electoral votes by increasing his plurality in states that he knows he will win. This is a desirable result because a candidate with only regional appeal is unlikely to be a succesful president. The residents of the other regions are likely to feel disenfranchised, to feel that their votes do not count, that the new president will have no regard for their interests, that he really isn't their president.    
182	In paragraph one the author give us some little facts about Venus such has how we can see Venus from Earth itself and another name for Venus that many people may have never heard of Evening Star . 
183	The technology in 2018 is getting bigger and smarter. The technology is taking over jobs and everything. 
184	The electoral college is a process that the founding fathers established in the constition. The electoral college consits of 538 electors and a majority of 278 votes. 
185	30 minutes to our self we barely have enough time to eat its insane that we really have no social time.  But yet teachers wonder why we are so talkative in class this is my conclusion to this solution to the talking in class solution to the texting in class solution. 
186	I would say i am on both sides. 
187	The new hit  the face,  has made its way through tv, and articles all across the world. This phenonim is about a small land form on the suface of Mars that takes the look of a face. There a million hypothesis of what it could be, but we have found what it really is. With research we found a logical reson to how we are correct. Some think its from aliens, and some think its just a natural land form but what is it? 
188	I think if you are failing a class you should focus on that grade and bringing it up and getting it to at least a C or B . I also think that kids that get in trouble shouldnt be allowed to because they didnt listen or did something they wasnt suppose to . Why give a kid this if they dont listen, they dont deserve to do something like this is they are being disrespectful or not listening. Students that do get good grades above a  D ad F and arent disrespectful should be able to do this if they wanted to. 
189	freedom 
190	Also, if the person does make a mistake they should be able to unelect them also cause people need what is best for are country. 
191	This shows that with the Electoral College, not every region is going to have electoral votes. Therefore, it would not be fair for those regions. Perhaps their votes would not count and basically the chosen president would not pay attention to them. 
192	Electoral college have different ways and similar ways from changing to the election by the popular for the president of United States.For example states in source one  The Electoral College consists of the 538 electors . A Majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the president.  
193	First the unimaginable heat on Venus can make metal boil in a snap 
194	Striving to meet Venus is challenging But one challenge were willin to take 
195	They use video imagery the software tracks the facial movements. The painted face of mona lisa by tweaking diffrent units the computer can identify mixed emotions. every expression is compared against a face, The demonstration could bring a smile to your face, for example. If you smile when a AD appears on your screen the computer will bring up another AD that is similar to the AD your looking at right now. But if you frown the next AD won't be the same. According to the facial feedback using your facial mucsles doesn't only express human emotion they also help produce them. 
196	congress should consider the thoughts and opinions that us voters have. If they wish to not do so the candidate with the popular votes could potentially lose presidency. 
197	In the article it states The 'face on Mars' has since become a pop icon.  The news is everywhere in places you might not expect! I think the scientists are excited about what they found. Did you enjoy hearing all the news about the Face on Mars? 
198	By keeping it everyone is happy and will accept things easier. But if we were to abolish it the towns and cities would go and rampage with families borken and friendships being torn apart. And we can prevent that by just keeping the electoral college.    
199	It just makes it more easier for people to not do anything. 
200	You should not make it required to stay after school because we might have a job,parents that are divorced,wont have much time to chill, and our siblings might have to walk there house by them self.  
201	B' s are considered above average. What about the average people, who really are trying? Can't they still do what they want to do? C' s are considered average 
202	if we were to drive less 
203	Because if we give this country over to the wrong president our country could fall and we could go under. One of the reasons that our country is still standing today is because we as a nation have pick a great president, without hessition. Back in the old days we didnt have a right to vote. We are blessed to be able to vote and a system like the electrol college today. If we lose the electrol college we lose hope and faith that our country we be still standing.  
204	Now if for some reason the majority voted in a really crazy man into office that would completely corupt the government then it would be good too have something else that can change teh vote so that America does not get anymore corrupted. 
205	ansd that will be the next year so useing the electoral collage  will allow u to be able to vote on time and mnot miss be ing able to vote becaus evoting is im portant to the county or the contonet to be counted on not only you but others around so u can have a choice of what you want to have as a presedent of the united states 
206	i would make cars to use for transportion but i would not let everybody paid 500 for the car notes. then telvison have a long been fascinated cause it been there longer so when i get done i would make my cars and telvison. we got make alot drive way and it going be alot traffic. some people dont crash that mean it alot people can drives. Some people can't drive because they didnt pay attienion on the road because text and drive then they crash. people like us we follow the direction on the road so we wont get crash or ran over anything so the car wont get hit by any thing. but we can get together on the road some people like to text and die i dont wont nobdy to see that. Some people dont pay attenion to the light on the street oor not in the right lane or turn when u suppose to turn that why we got lot driverless. Then alot people dont got they driver liences. Then people dont be in the lane right turn when u suppose to turn. some people can't park right because they dont pay attetions. that why we dont get caught. if you can't find what you want then u can get a navigating so you can be on your way to whatever your you go. that why driverless are coming. 
207	In the article  The challenge of Exploring Venus,  the author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy to go explore from the dangers that Venus has. 
208	We have to find out and learn.  
209	If a human gets hurt then the emotion and the expression would be squinting there eyes being loud or holding whatever got hurt. 
210	According to the Facial feed back theory of emotion which is moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotion they may also even help produce them Constanin had his actors carfully reproduce smiling and frowning as a way of creating these emotions on stage 
211	Sometime out can not get your grades all up to passing in time. also i am not good at school but i still try.  I think i should get the right to play sport because sports can be job when you get older and it will also keep you in shape just not that but aliened.  So based on behavior i think they could not be able to play but just not because of bad grades. 
212	I would like to put my opinion about students being required to perform community service. 
213	NASA believed to be coming up with multiple ways for humans to set foot on the planet without any complications, at the moment NASA's only way of getting near the planet with stable temperatures and pressure is by having a  blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the roiling Venusian landscape.  
214	There is also no completely proof that it is alien proof, and making a face on a planet would not be the best way to comunicate with humans. 
215	And its also called the Earth's twin, becues the closest plant to shape like earth in tearms of density and size, and its the closeset plant to earth, somtimes its vence that closest to earth and somtimes its Mars, humans tried sending space crafts to land on venus, but none of them manged to servive the landing for more then few hours and that explains why no speaceship manged to go there yet for more then three decades. 
216	the people vote for who they think is right for the job not just random people vote its unanimus decison to who wins. There is no reason to change the way things are going it has always been the same way the whole time ever since the united states was made in the first place. the people elect that is the advantage of a democracy which we have and in a democracy we vote by majority and thats how it most likley will stay in the united states no matter who the goverment is trying to vote in who they want but the united states is the power to vote in who goes into the office not the goverment so there is no chane of rigging all the votes so the unites states should not change to a popularity vote. power to the people is an old metaphor that indicates that we have the power to vote unlike in other countries where one man rules and the people have no power to vote for the best man to take over so in an electoral college we have all mighty power to make our own decisons to our future. 
217	Accordig to the facial feedback ''theory of emotion movig your facial muscles not only expresses emotions but also may even help produce them''. 
218	Introducing driverless cars to today's society would be a very big step in technology. 
219	On May 24,2001 NASA sent Viking 1 in to outer space but what it found were still trying to figure out could there be life on Mars. The Viking sent back pictures of mars carved into it was a illusion of eyes nose and mouth so let me say again can there be life not just on earth but on Mars the question is still to be answerd. NASA says the have witness alot of things up that we dont know or could even imagin there could be life on every plant and if there is I know we all want to witness it one day. I know I am not the only one who would want to explore through out the box through out the earth but may I say the question is still out there for me for you for the future. So let that be known that you and me and what ever is out there are alike curious to seek and craving for advanture. You and me both will fly out of here hand by hand sister to brother to find whats on mars in the future qustion that is waiting to be answerd will be seen head smelled by the ones who are seeking that adventure to answer that qustion that we all what to know. Is there life on mars.   
220	Every people have different types of emotions. It's true that they have different kinds of emotions but what if it is fake? 
221	The author suggest that studying venus is a worthy pursuit 
222	We should explore venus 
223	The only problem is how many times would you vote for a crazy person who you know will affect you in a very major way? My guess is not very often.  
224	The students should follow Policy 1 , so they can have a time just to themselves and chill. 
225	And marketing would sky rocket. 
226	YES THEY SHOULD KEEP THE VOTERS AND THAT THEY SHOULD KEEP THE VOTERS JUST INCASE THE VOTERS DONT NEED TO COMPARE THE ELECTIONS AND THATS HOW THEY WOULD MAKE THERE FINAL DECISION AND THEN THEY WOULD MAKE THE FINAL DECISION WHO TO VOTE FOR AND IT COMES UP BETWEEN THE STATES.YES THEY SHOULD DO A FINAL VOTE DECISION AT THE END OF IT. 
227	The passage  Drivless Cars are Coming  have negative and positives. 
228	Paris enforced a partical driving ban to clear the airr of the global ci ty. If they didnt leave their cars at home they would have been fined for $31.  Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five-years of intensifying smog. China is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world . But paris typically has more smog than other European capitals.. Last week paris had 147 micrograms of particulate matter (PM) per cubic meter .  President Obama's ambitious goals to curb the United States' greenhouse gasemissions, unveiled last week will get a fortuitous assist from an incipient shift in American behavior.  With all these changes, people who stopped car commuting asa result of the recession may find less reasons to resume the habit    
229	Not everyone has cars or uses cars for that matter. 
230	those may be boring, nasty etc, but just always know you're doing something by helping your community. 
231	They talk about what they going to bring and how far it is and what they are going to be doing. in the passage he talked about what happen in the war and how did it affect . and maybe having electronics up there too. 
232	But before they could see the face they had to go thorght wispy clouds and they had to wait for winter to be over. But after all that on a cloudless summer day they finally got to see the face. 
233	The governor has to prepare the Certificate of Ascertainment.  What the Certificate of Ascertainment do is that it declares the winning presindential of the state and it doesn't just declares who is  the winning presidential it additionaly shows you will electors are going to represent your state atr the meeting of the electors  in December of the election Year. Finally your state's Certificates of Ascertainment they are sent to the Congress of your country and the National archives it as part of the official  records of the presidential election. 
234	First, I would like to say that this is a really good topic the author brings forth to the table, 
235	In paragraph 4 the author tells us even though Venus's surface had conditions five times more extreme than what we see on Earth, long ago it was covered with large oceans, rocky sediment and craters. If Venus's conditions used to be so similar to Earth then could it possibly have supported life? 
236	These facts lead to the evidence is many ways 
237	They are making technology to read the emotional expressions and that it knowns when your lieing. 
238	With all the crashes maybe we should drive without our phones but with the increments in technology we mind as well just use them cars are able to call people just like phones, so if you can call people in your car and be distracted anyways when your calling whom ever 
239	In paragraph 6 the author uses the exmple of how we could use this new technology during school for example he wrote,  If you smile when a web ad appears on you screen a similar ad might follow. But if you frown, th next ad might be different.  
240	because it's a place where we vote on President and Vice President 
241	It's quite simply one vote makes one person win the presidentcy. 
242	The Electoral College consists of 538 electors the majority only 270 votes is required for the final dessision. Each candidate running for the president has his or her own group of electors but the state law varys how many are selected. The presidential election is held every four yearson the tuesday after the first monday of november.  The states are called districts for example the word state also refers to the disrict of Columbia. 
243	Make them get more involved 
244	And sense that day everyone it's okay with stuff that they don't understand, because they know that is just something new. 
245	By doing a Facial Action Coding to a classroom full of students would be different and interesring 
246	This means that the larger the state (in population, not size), the more their overall vote weighs 
247	By keeping the Electoral College, we will be able to express our different political references. 
248	Connected to, served by, or available through a system and especially a computer or telecommunications system as the internet also done while connected to a system, online shopping. 
249	if they are old they can choose what they want, they have to think very careful 
250	In conclusion people should be able to vote because then we'd be able to choose,so they could feel better about knowing who is passing laws and fixing their country. I may be under age but, I know if I were allowed to vote I'd want to vote for who runs my country and who helps run it. 
251	but i personally believe that it should be for those who want to 
252	my friend its nspire me the want to study in my home because i want being architect but i need to strain. 
253	in the u. s. it is a law that you have to have your phone down from your hands while driving or at least have a Bluetooth device that can connect to your phone to your car so you don't have to look at your phone to call or answer a call while your driving a car 
254	I think i like the new technology that the person invented it can detect your emotins and feelings. And i doubt others can invent something like that 
255	Thats why all the states should have the same number of votes so the candidates would go there to try to win them over 
256	So i would pick policy 1 but if their using it in class then i would take policy 2 to teach them a lesson. I wouldn't care if they got mad serve them right. So remember always be fair especially if it's about phones everyone again I'm going to say everyone loves their phones. I would take in to consideration that you would select policy 1  
257	the challenge of exploring venus is one of the brightest points of light in the night sky, making it simple for even an amateur stargazer to spot. however, this nickname, is misleading since venus is actually a planet. In a solar system, venus is the second planet from our sun.  they call venus like the earth twin..  Venus is the closest to Earth in terms of density and size, and occasionally the closest in distance too. Earth, venus, and mars,our other planetary neighbor, orbit the sun at different speeds. While venus is simple to see from the distant but safe ventage pointof Earth, it has proved a very challenging place to examine more closely.  MY ESSAY.  The callenge of exploring venus is one of the biggest points of light in the night sky, these differences is speed mean that sometimes we are closer to mars and others times to venus. Because venus is sometimes right aroundthe corner in space terms humans have sent numerous spacecraft to land on this cloud draped world A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent dioxide blankets venus. Also notable, venus has the hottest surface temperature af any planet in our solar system, even though mercury is closer to our sun. astronomers are fascinated by venus because it may well once have been the most Earth like planet in our solar system. long ago, venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth. Today, venus still has some features that are analogous to those on Earth. The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such ass valleys, mountains, and craters. Imagine a blimp like behicle hovering 30 or so miles above the roiling venusian landscape. However, peering at venus from a ship orbiying or hovering safely far above the planet can provide only limited insight on ground conditions bacuse most forms of light cannot penetrate the dense atmosphere, rendiring standard forms of photography and videography ineffective. A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent dioxide blankets venus. 
258	The Bridges, if the bridges are week, then it will break, so don;t drive on the week bridges. Another thing is that people like to drive fast and they just drive in the red light. One more thing is traffic jam, in traffic jam people like to hurry, so they hit on another cars. 
259	The Driverless people can cause problems. 
260	The Electoral College has a consist selection of the electors, the meeting of electors where they can vote for President and Vice President, and counting electoral votes by congress.  The Electoral College has 538 electors, and majority of 270 electoral votes that is required to elect the presedent. Also, under the 23rd amendment of the constitution, the distric of columbia is allocated 3 electors and treated like a state for this reason, the word  state  also refers to district of columbia.  Plus, the presidential election is held every 4 years on a Tuesday after the first Monday of in November, and when you choose your states electors when you vote for president, you also are actually voting for your candidates electors. After the presidential election, the governor of your state prepares a listing of all the candidates who ran for President in your state along with the names of their respective electors called,  Certificate of Ascertainment .  Your state also sends a Certificates of ascertainment to the Congress and National Archives as part of the official records of thee presidential election. The Electoral College is also a widely regarded as an anachronoism, which is a non-democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be overruled by the candidates who recieved the most popular votes the winner.  This positions are correct in arguing that the Electroal College method is not democratic in modern sense, but it is the electors who elect the president, not the people. When people vote for the president they are actually voting for a state of electors. 
261	Furthermore, I believe we should keep the Electoral College for the president of the  United States because everything is label right. 
262	The American people thought they were lucky that 2000 fiaso was the biggest crisis in a century. The state legislatures are responsible for the picking electors. So maybe it was there fault, all I'll tell you this, they were not very lucky 
263	striving to meet the challenge presented by venus has value. because human curiosty will likely lead us into many equally intimidating enveavors. travelers on earth and beyond should not be limited by danger to explore venus more. venus should be expanded to help meet the edges of imagination and inovation.  
264	but if they think about it instead of waisting your time just guessing what their emotions are you would know if they use the proper techonology. They had made a process that began when the computer constructed a 3-D computer model of the face and it showed that all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles. 
265	but, either way the method of selecting the president may turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state anyways. 
266	The tem relalized that there were no aliens after all. 
267	It would also be better because the kid can talk their friends on the other side of the building. 
268	The  Face on Mars  has become popular. 
269	The one thing it didn't mention in the artical was his family where were they the whole time Luke was on board.  The artical never mentioned a mom or dad.  Was Luke alone with no communication skills. 
270	simplified electronics 
271	eventually i got a call from NASA they wanted me to join them. They said my work was outstanding and they would love to work with me, my immediate answer was yes. My immediate answer was yes because NASA was my dream job even when i was younger i wanted to be in NASA.  
272	they will make friends 
273	we shouldn't be held to that by other people and their threats. We should be the ones to care for our grade ,and if it gets too low we should take responsibility and take ourselves out of sports. 
274	Now if it was for an expermint to see how you are really feeling then go ahead 
275	Studying venus would be really interesting but venus is hard to study because it´s dangerous and it has really high pressure.  
276	, and you can tell by thier face exprestion or by the actions they do through out the day..In paragraph three it's showing us by saying    raise your eyebrows when you're suprise ; your orbicularis oris (around your mouth)tighten your lips to show anger  every person that i know off knows that . 
277	please go find a passion because you cant keep doing this and wasting your life away. Go water some plants, and make your bed, or make another persons bed. Just do somethign else other that sit here and read a bunch of essays that a essentially meaning less. You need something more in life and i do as well 
278	I honestly think it has been made up by an illusion. 
279	Which is not every fair some people are'nt as rih as others so they sould'nt descrimate people by the way they look or dress. Because for all you know they look gurst so your not going to try and listen or understand where they came from. But they could be President material they just dont have the outter look, that everyones looking for. Don't judge a book by it cover.  
280	If they dont get to choose there leader than there is no point in doing this stuff at all. This should be a real democracy and let the people vote. 
281	Venus is some times closer to Earth the Mars is humans have send spacecafts to land on Venus but one thing about the dangers no human shoukd go it would be something to look in too. 
282	If we used democracy, only 51% of voters would be needed. But with Electoral Votes, it keeps little states from having too much power and say. 
283	Then their parents could be proud of them for how good they did on that sport. 
284	I will like to argue about the Electoral College. 
285	Studnets, should go schools this is not matter do you want go home school or normal school. 
286	Each candidate running for president in your state has his or her own group of electors. The electors are generally chosen by the candidate's political party, but state laws vary on how the electors are selected and what their responsiblities are.... (office of the federal register, source 1). 
287	that would be unseen for there to be a computer of any such to even exist. 
288	wrecks would be less common if the mechanics work on the cars they provide. Companies think to much of money so that would be the only problem. I mean sure they wold not make as much money as they would like to but people would be a lot more safe then they are. The money they make should go to the coverage of peoples cars.  
289	I just heard that you are trying to decide on a very big topic. I thought i would wright you a letter to let you know what I think. 
290	If you are willing to vote, choose carefully and be percise with your answer. Don't let others get in your way, it's your choice and time, so express a political preference rather than deciding an election. 
291	Candidate what do you think of when I say that word well If I had to guess a said president. President that when  each party selects a president that the people  trust to help this Nation. 
292	Students know what to do so, If they want to take their time, online class is one of the best way to take their time. If I start taking online class I will save my time on the other hand I develop my knowledge. Fixing The way of i'm studying before. Most students are hated studying at home. They don't want to studying at home. Instead of studying they prefer to play games. But, If they have online class they starting study and they will fix their problem. That is better way to improve skills. Students become work hard and study hard. They will get good job. 
293	A dispute over the outcome of an electoral college vote is possible it happened in 2000 but its less likely than a dispute over the popular vote the reason is that the winning candidates share of the electoral college invairably exceeds his share of the popular vote in 2012's election for example Obama received 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to 51.3 percent of the popular votes cast for him and Romney .  . . . because almost all states award electoral votes on a winner take all basis even a very slight plurality in a state creates a landslide electoral vote victory in that state A tie in the nationwide electoral vote is possible because the total number of votes 538 is an even number but it is higly unlikely .....  
294	I love being able to go out on the sea and have fun will helpping people with there problems make me super happy and I wouldn't have this job if my friend didn't tell me about it. For example (the world war11) I got to go to many places like China, Europe, and Italy.  I was happy to help all this people with there problems and when we got to go on a ship, we had the opportunity to take turns to watch over the animals at night to feed them and to make sure that nothing bad is happening like fighting our the bottom of the ship is being filled up with water.  So I signed up to watch them and so I got the job. I had to stay up super late to watch them and to I went to tell the captin that every thing was okay and so on my way I slipped on some water and I fell.  I had almost fell overboared but I didn't, thanks to a peice of meatel on the side of the boat and i was happy that I didnt die. I am thankful that I am still alive after breaking my ribs, and slidding down a latter. I soon recovered and was back to the job and so we took all the animals back to were they were.  So we made a game place were they were. We played a whole bunch of games and we did are ruiten, until we had another jod were we had to go get animals and watch over them. I am thankful to be able to do this job with people who care about me and support me well this job.  I wonder what are next job will be? Will I break another bone in my body? Can I survie another animal watch? Will I survie breaking another bone in my body? I don't know if i can survie another bone in my boby that can be broken?  After about a month we get a call to go get some animals and so we went to go get them and I have to say it was a long ride to go to Teaxs and it was close to were my uncle lived and so we got there and there was a huge sand storm and so we had to go get alll the horses, and take them to the sea and then I relized that my uncle had this one horse and it did not like me at all. As we were getting the horses around I seen that horse. The captin asked me if I wanted to watch the animals that week and I said  , Yes I will'. So I was up all night watching all the horses and so I had to feed them. I was feed the one horse that hated me the most and it kicked me right in the neck as I was feeding him. I was out for a really long time and my best friend came down there and found me on the floor  sleeping . 
295	The Electoral college process consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for President and Vice President, and the counting of electorals votes by Congress. The Electoral College consists of 538 electors. A majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the President. Under the 23rd Amendmentof the Constitution, the District of Columbia is allocated 3 electors and treated like a state for purposesof the Electoral College.  Each candidate running for President in your state has his or her own group of Electors.I know the electors are generally chosen by the candidate's politicail party, but state law vary on how the electors are selected and what their responsibilities are .. Also the Presidential election is geld every four years on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. 
296	Some people may think this new technology may be an awesome technology 
297	its a good process and it keeps us from having the problem of elections in which no candidates receives a majority of the votes cast. 
298	The things that are wrong with use the electoral college is that is the person gets their votes for thir state the might just win because, the more the people that live there more of the votes that they might get. 
299	When I get a good grade on my test and it is above 76 I am so happy that  I got a good grade on a test.  The reason I try to make good grades so I can go an stay at my friends house that is another reason I try to make good grades.  Another reason I like to keep my grades up is to be able to go to my moms house and that is one of my favorite places to go and stay. The other reasons I like to keep my grades up is so I don't get intruble so I do not have to do so much at the house and not being able to go fishing with my dad and that is another reason I like to get good grades. Another reason I like to get my grades up is so I can get to go to college. 
300	I have to tell that the idea of tell us about this cange and for give us the opportunity to let us tell you, our opinion is good. 
301	once in a while ytheir are times when popluar vote wins but electoral loses 
302	Taking care of the animals was a great way for me to pass the time and helping my aunt Katie's farm made it alot easier. We arrived in Europe right after the pacific war. After Europe we packed our animals and headed up to Greece. I turned 18 before reaching greece so i was old enough to get drafted into the millitary, But they told me that i should just keep doing what im doing. The sea cowboys program is a great way to do millitary service to. . 
303	if it's gonna lead to a riot or people rising up to the company because of the computers,  we want regular computers back not the stupid emotional ones anymore!  u know... i would do the same thing as well.            
304	To me I like it if you all would let it be the popular vote not by some college. 
305	then i feel lik that would seperte our world even moe ut this time is seperate from eachother from our closest friends and family because they would become our friends and they will become our family. i think if you want to end bulling and family problems etc. then is still not a good idea. like i said this still leads to segragation within ourseleves 
306	Most people that I have seen have got into something just to say that they are in not because they want to help they, just want to make their self look good and thats not OK. We can't always force someone to do something they dont want to do. 
307	I think that fellow citizens should have the advantages to car usage, because not everyone would feel comfortable ridding around in a bus or a train with lots of other people 
308	Driverless cars could be the next common technology among the human population like computers or phones.  From this, humanity will continue evolving and strive through conflicts similar to this subject.  However, another choice for us, individually is whether or not to accept change.        
309	The best arguments in favor is the popular vote, but some canidates still lose from the presidency. 
310	By not letting kids play sports they will change school to a school that lets them play sports with a c average. 
311	Policy 2 is an unfair unlike Policy 1 which give us a choice. 
312	Either one is wrong nor right. If I were to see it myself then I would say it looks like an alien's face. If there was some type of other evdience then thats when we know what it is. One clue isnt gonna help as much, unless we were to have more edvidence/ clues 
313	The bad thing of this emotion recognition is that students with medical issues that affects their learning because of it affecting them from using technology. 
314	People might agree with Car-free day. But i disagree with it. Now i will tell you three why I disagree. 
315	Different people have different answers depending on what they mean. one example would be if you asked for a science question, the easiest answer would be... the perpendicularity of the potosytithsis crosses the bisector witch then the kinetic energy will bounce off the radios and hit the diameter witch then will colaps on the pythagerm therom,So now the genetic energy will explode like if it was uranium 232 witch then the servers will connect and create millions of nitros and million of galaxies will explode, all of these thing combined will make the Mississippi river,BUT I'M NOT DONE YET, after that is done the microwaves fusses and make the chemical reaction witch is using thermal energy ,so then the protons,electrons,neutrons,and the nukul s combines witch then you use length times wight and also height. So that brings us back to the question, when people ask for advice they sometimes talk to more then one person.  So you see that the potato has nine lives and the cat has 1 what is the difference between the two. that one cannot die and the other one can 
316	A large state gets more attention from Presidential candidates in a campaign then a small state does. 
317	Most  counterclaims to my explanation is swing states 
318	It also helps the U.S by giving us a president. 
319	Also, it is possible for worker of the Electoral College to make a mistake in countung the counting the votes and to cause a big confussion in the votes but that is very highly impossible, if not impossible. 
320	''THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE IS A PROCESS NOT A PLACE THE FOUNDING FATHERS ESTABLISHED IT IN THE CONSTITUTION AS A COMPRIMISE BETWEEN ELECTION OF THE PRESIDENT BY VOTE IN CONGRESS AND ELECTIION OF THE PRESIDENT  BY A POPULAR  VOTE OF QUALIFIED CITIZENS''.THIS PROCESS CONSISTS OF 538 ELECTORS. ALSO EACH CANDIDATE RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT IN YOUR STATEHAS HIS OR HER OWN GROUP OF ELECTORS. 
321	There was no technology back when the Mona Lisa was made. They had pictures and the picture showed emotion. There are some people that can see the emotions of people and some are herd to see then others. 
322	some people can not do some thing like some people can not do sports like working want people some work just there self some teacher don't do activity the principal don't why should the student do some just not that good what. 
323	I'm a scientist and there are some explanation to why this face exsict on both sides 
324	think about i kid who like to play sports would only have to do the minimal amount of work to do what they love if u put it up to a B kids who play sports would have to try harder to do what they love that would improve test scores for the school and help a lot of things.  and look at how many kid play sport u could make more sports so more kids would want to join the sports and then more kids would have to try to get better grades to do the sport they love it would also help no child left behind law by improving test scores so u can get better funding for your school and the funds could go to the sports so more people would want to play them so more people would have to get there grades up witch would improve more test scores so u could aford good things for the sch 
325	The challenge of exploring venus is so one knows what is there. Pluse no one knows anything about it soneone would have to go. Then agian it would take forver to get there and there whould be no air maybe bc its in space. 
326	It keeps a steady stream when it comes time to vote because aslong as someone had 270 votes you know thats who will get picked. so why try changing that and have a whole new system put in and then not know what to do when it comes time to vote. And what if the new system dosent work, what if the new way of the voting process messes with the tallys and they come out wrong and no one will get picked, unlike the other way when u know everything will come out right and u know that we will have a president. I think its fair that they have it set at 270 for voting that way everyone havs a chance to vote instead of it being so low that only a few people get to vote before they shut it down because they have reached there number of tallys that they need.  So if they change the number of tallys that a president needs to become president that will be stupid and people will act out on it because they wont think its right, and because the people who didnt vote will not like the fact that they didnt get to put there vote f in before they stoped the voting and because they meet the number that they needed. Its a vote why do they need to title it as a the vote of a president or a popular vote of a president. Why not just vote for there just electors instead of saying vote for your candidate when really you are just voting for the electors. If you are voting for a certin thing there is no reason that u have to re-word it just to vote, if you are voting for something do it the right way instead of changing stuff and making it seem one way when really its the other way. Why should the electoral get just as much as the winning presindent? They are not doing as much as the president  and who is helping him out.. so they should not get the same reword.    
327	because this nation called the united sates is a democracy it is ruled for the people and by the people, when the government descides to go by the electoral college votes thats not ruling by the people because our nation dosent only consists of 538 electors we each have our own voices. we consists of 50 states all together if the government cant conduct electoral colleges in each state then it shouldnt be around in the first, we the people all have different opinions and outlooks on the universe it shouldnt only be counted for about 538 electors it unfair. and god knows where the electoral colleges are held and if they are being completely fair to everyone their are their all ethnicities from all over the nation, is it normal people that have nine to five jobs so they understand the struggles of an average person making 60,000 dollars a year, or are they picking business men and housewives that live in suburben neighborhoods. The nation have been completely blind sided by these things its just a scapegoat on picking the right president in their eyes and not in the peoples eyes. 
328	Luke wants to be a segoing cowboy because he likes to travel the seas and he also likes to be a cowboy. Another reason is because he wants to have fun as a cowboy and he really wants to go travel the seas. He wants to have fun because he never has fun at his house so that is why he wants to have some fun. His house is probably boring so that is also why he wants to go outside and have some fun at the program because he wants to get out of his house and have fun. He wants to go outside and do the program so he can be a cowboy and have fun. 
329	why make them do something that they wont even enjoy . I f the students don't enjoy what their doing then they wont understand the lesson that they are suppose to learn from the experience. 
330	Im all for the values of using this new emotion technology because you tell if people are faking a smile. You can tell because when you fake it you dont use the same muscles as when you really smile. When you fake smile the muscles you use are zygomatic major that make your mouth stretche sideways and the risori. But when you really smile you use the muscles called zygomatic major that begin at your cheek bones and life the corners of your mouth. The other muscle you use is called orbicularis oculi pars palpabraeus which makes crow's-feet around your eyes.  
331	The software is the latest innovation from prof,Thomas Huang if the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science at the University OF  lllinois. Some day I want be like him,He is my idol from now. Also If someone ask me who would I want to meet right now,I would say  I want to meet with Dr. Huang . 
332	aliens could be on Mars and we would of never knew but they took a photo on the wrong night so they had to go back and see it again 
333	Driverless Cars can help people life more easier. Even if it can make the environment much better than before. Because now we have many cars drive on the street and they will have some bad thing to make the environment be bad.  A lot of people, they are smart. They think that in one day, we maybe making computer-diven cars. In fact, this is a smart way to make people llife easier. But this make more and more people to make smarter than this way to make people life easier.  Then they find a new way to developed driver's seats and they have lights. It can help them drive on the road at night and make people to be safety. 
334	parents wants there kids to go to school because they want there kids to have a better education then, them when there were kids and have a better life. so they don't have to do or find there way around things. parents want there kids to have a easier life. if students don't go to school this there is no reason to even have schools in the first place and just clean the community every day like its a job and don't get paid at all. its better to go to school because when you get to you are paid to go to school. not like its free and you want or you don't want. now this days students, will do anything to get out of class and out of school. students would fly school because they want to give away there one and only chance to find a good job. they would even try to get in trouble and get sent home and there parents don't care if they do that or even if the teacher calls them and say that ur kid however some may say that community is better because it keeps the community a better places to live but some teachers and parents disagree with this because teachers are like your second parents and they want u to go to school then do community service. 
335	Some people don't really agree with the electoral college process because they belive that if you vote you are voting for electors of your state that eventually vote for you at the end 
336	I think students can be benefit 
337	I'm not going to lie and say that none of the people who do get to vote are all voting because they know their stuff about the candidates, but some of us who do know about the candidates and how they are working should not lose the right to vote for who ever we would like. If we dont get to vote for who we like and believe is better then what type of country are we.  
338	Sometimes studying things can be real helpful because you can learn so many things about it. The article states, ¨These differences in the speed mean that sometimes we are closer to Mars and other times we are closer to  Venus.¨ 
339	Everything that is rong with the electoral collage 
340	The one thing I like about the voting system is that people can pick who would be the best candidate for our nation. For example, I find it a terrible mistake that people picked Obama and all the stuff he had promised in the pass and still haven't kept his words. In my opinion, I think Obama daughter can build a better system than him. It whatever though, it the people choice that they want Obama to be president of the United States. I just think he just a liar to our nation. 
341	Humans perfom the same amount of emotions everyday. 
342	Plan:A photo from 1998,is a pciture of a mask. So why they  MGS  claims is not a face? We don't,be we do know is that a high-resolution images and 3D altimetry takes picture from outer space. It says that  NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft was circling the planet,snapping photo possible landing sites for it's sister ship . 
343	Also the negatives of the electoral college are not really a big deal that coud cause a fixing or a inbalenced vote towards one side over another 
344	What people thought who they picked was all for change, and just makes their own rules that not helping,but hurting everyone is why the smaller states are up set about it. 
345	That's why it isnt a good idea to be making driverless cars. 
346	Most of 270 electoral votes are required to elect the president. The number of members in its Congressional delegation is equal to the entitled allotment of electors in your state, one is for each member in the house of Representatives plus two for the Senators. For the purposes of Electoral College, Columbia District is allowed 3 electors and is treat like a state. and when i say  state  for this topic i mean the District of Columbia. 
347	According to Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother, when she had a car, she was always tense. Now that she told it, Walter seemed to be much happier. In Freiburg, Vurban's streets are  care-free . But, once you go to the main thoroughfare, cars will be sworming down the road. Most people may think,  I need a car to get to where I need to go faster.   I can't live without a car.   In 2006, trend in Europe grew... No cars or anything. Automobiles are the linchpin of suburbs where middle class families from Chicago to Shanghai make their homes. Passanger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions. 50 percent in some car intensive area in US. Home to 5,500 residents within a rectangular square mile, may be the most advanced experiment in low car suburban life.  Levittown and Scarsdale, New York suburbs with enormous rich people homes with private garages were dream towns back in the 1950s. The US is promoting  car reduced  communities, and legislators are starting to act. 
348	It should be on the peoples votes since they are the ones being affected by the changes. Not by the Electoral College.  The winner-take-all system is not fair what so ever. If there are more votes foe whatever president in that state then the electors will go for that president. This is like bandwagoning for football teams. If they go to the national championship they will change to that team. This voting shopuld change to the peoples votes instead of this winner-take-all system. It is more fair and balanced.  Think of it this way in 2012 that more people voted for Mitt Romney but the electors didnt think so that is unfair. Right? The voting needs to be changed once and for all to a popular vote system instead of the Electoral College. This is the best way for the United States to deal with this madness. One solution and you are one step forward to a better Nation.  
349	the author did support his story with facts that if we dont do it now then human curiosity will do it later 
350	No voting especailly in swing states can make your party, or your wanted candiadate loose the election.  Every year some of the swing states change so everyone should vote especially those in the swing states to insure your party or your candidate win. 
351	A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets venus. if our sister planet is so inhospitable why are scientists even discussing futher visits to its surface 
352	The National Aeronautics and Space Administration has one particularly compelling idea for sending humans to study Venus. NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditiond on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray. If you image blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or more miles above the roiling Venusian landscap, it would be a shocker. Temperatures would still be tasty at around 170 degrees Fahrenheit, but the air pressure would ber close to the level of the sea and Earth.

354	More than half of the entire world is obese, the number of obese citizens is growing larger and larger. The use of technology plays a very large role in obesity. Young children and people of all ages for that fact grow addicted to social media, video games, and many other things. The use of cell phones, which many people can not go anywhere without, harms the brain and kills the cells in your brain along with exposing your body to unneeded radiation. 
355	Your principal has decided that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity . For example , students could participate in sports ,  work on the yearbook ,  or serve on the student council .  
356	each canidate running for president in your state has his or her own group of electors .  
357	Example; like the elections a President can't be a President with out votes, the country pick their own candidates and the citizens give the vote to the person they pick best for their country  Most likely everything have a vote in our community fuction nothing move with out a vote to people is fair to vote, that how it works  
358	NASA was looking for Viking 2 so they could find Viking 1's sister 
359	In each state the cadinate that is running for that paticular has their own group of electors that in safe hands 
360	Venus has a thick atmoshpere, so it makes it harder to breathe. 
361	In the article The End Of Car Culture  Elisabeth Rosenthal says:But America's love affair with its vehicles seems to be cooling. When adjusted for population growth,the number of miles driven in the United States peaked in 2005 and dropped steadily thereafter,according to an analysis by Doug Short of Advisor Perspectives,an ivestment research company. As of April 2013, the number of miles driven per person was nearly 9 percent below the peak and equal to where the country was in January 1995. A study last year found that driving by young people decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009....  Also in the article: Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota the author,Andrew Selsky says: In a program that's set to spread to other countries,millions of Colombians hiked,biked,skated or took buses to work during a car-free day yesterday,leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams.  
362	Another last reason why i dont beiieve it should be in the classrooms because just as i said in the other paragraph that peoplemight notlike it or might now want people to know how they feel becuase it might be personal. 
363	Some people dont like tovote in fear of their party not winning due to its unpopularity. 
364	I am the few students who are in the middle 
365	You can learn who was the first to land on Venus and who was the last and how long you can stay on Venus until you have to come back down to Earth for more food and supples 
366	Elisabeth Rosenthal believes it to be  The End of Car Culture . What do you believe? Are you happy with the life you are living now?  Has America passed peak driving? .            
367	With the Electoral collage it allows for us to make there a set number on the amount of votes we can get. That being said the Electoral collaeg wpuld make it alot easier so the states adn national governmant to get the right amount of votes. 
368	We need to look at the prons and cons cause a person can tell if a person is showing any emotion is how they are useing their mouth's muscular actions such as smiling or frowning. Telling a force one a real smile can be que trickey but a computer can tell the differences. 
369	Knowing your faults is one thing, but acting upon them is important. Many students, when given a choice in their work, will choose not to work hard or procrastinate upon them. I can attest to this myself, as I set many self projects for myself that I do not complete. Students who are hard working and care about their grade will complete their goals. 
370	Therefore those are my reasons for wanting to change the system of electoral voting to be changed to popular voteing. 
371	My conclusion is that if you think that havind an unshaped car is bad or even if it looks weird dont think that its a bad car because technology its changing our daily lifes and how we see the un expected about it. 
372	Dr. Huang even knew individuals showed degrees of exprssions 
373	Third, The Electoral College has each canididate running for president in your stare has his or her own group of electors  said In Defense of the Electoral College: Five Reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the president. 
374	In a worst case scenario the school could get sued by a student getting a white slip, detention, ISS, suspended, or expelled and disagree about doing the wrong thing they did or if they where given it through  hard feelings  between a teacher and a student. 
375	 Luke heart race as he shot feet first toward and opening on the side of the ship. Luke was happy to beon board, especially when he return trips after the animals had been unloaded. He was happy to be alive, but he coudn't work for a couple of days because of his cracked ribs. 
376	In a nutshell, electoral college has its upsides and downsides and is still up today. I beileve its an easy thing to say it all depends on opinion and beilefs.    
377	That may put people in danger sending the crew up there. We can only think and hope that the artifact was created by aliens. The face on Mars is an icon for magazines and movies like  The Martian  and books like  The Lunar Chronicles . A single dicovered thing can turn sellers into money-makers easliy. All these fanatsy in books and movies, really can make us believe what we believe. 
378	After school at least 3 times a week we can help a family or person in need. 
379	I learned that doing activity's can bring you together with so many people its basicly changing how we act around or with others.  
380	By looking at A computer it can indicate what your truely felling. When someone doesnt have A facial expression on thier face the Facial Action Coding System can identify what they are truely felling. 
381	they also would not learn the amount of information as they would in school. 
382	Driverless cars need a whole lot of sensors. Radar was a device on a hiltop that cost two hundred million dollars. We should be investing that money on things that are important. For example help people in need, feed the hungry ect 
383	Dr. Huang stated that his computer can identify a persons feeling just by scaning them. By the way it look the computer can verify a person experssions by the way that they look even thou some poeple in this world can understand expressions but techology is change and now it can nearly tell human emotion. But yet the differences here are that the computer can see emotions or no emotions at all. 
384	in Vauban, Germany a residents of this upscale community aew suburban pioneers, where people have given up their cars. Automobiles are the linchpin of suburbs, where middle-class families from chicago to Shanghai tend to make their homes.  The residents are trying to make cities denser, and better for walking for the past two decades, so Vauban, home to 4,400 residents within a rectangularsquare mile, may be the most advanced experiment in low-car suburban life. In United States, the Environmental protection Agency is promoting  car reduced  communities, and legislators are starting to act, if cautiously. 
385	They always go to people who decide weather or not they should be approved, wich abviously the should if their whole or majority of the state voted for him/her. But thats not what the the feel, they feel like they need to aprove the runners.  why? , you ask? I'm not sure. If they need to do all that, why dont the people of the House Of Representatives just make their decisions? Since it always come down to them, then there's no point of the U.S Citizens voting for president. But then agian, I feel like why should they choose who is the president? If the whole USA are the one's who need to worry about the president. 
386	Online school would be the best choice to many students that just have it the ruff way and not easy. 
387	The reason why people go out to vote, is because they have a specific person in mind. Although throughout election time, many people are brought to different conclusions that one candidate is better then the other, or they both have their flaws yet, they strongly represent one thing the other candidate dispises. Either way, there are those types of people who just cannot decide. They may be left undecided, and have changed their minds by the time it's ready to vote 
388	I mean if we're going to be judged be our peers shouldnt we be elected by them to. When it comes down to it who exactle is voting for us and can we control who we'er voting for and from the evedence shown in  What's wrong with the electoral college  no we can't. And no matter who are what we vote for all were doing is expressing a political preference it dosent matter at all to them what we want all they care about is what they want and what they think is best. When it my be best for them but not for the rest of us. 
389	Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break . Should these summer projects be teacher designed or student designed ? 
390	For example, if you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a similar add might follow. Dr. Huang predict that   A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored.  Another prediction that Dr. Huang did was that  Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor.  Every human or most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication. 
391	There is a new software the has been developed that improves accuracy in perceiving the emotions of other. The Facial Action Coding System. They put a imagine of Mona Lisa Smile. In the applications called FACS knows how she is like how happy you are or angry. But with her they got a 83 percent happy, 9 percent disguested, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry. In the software is the latest innovation from prof. There is Thomas Huang, of the beckman institute for Advanced Science at the University of illinois, working in collaboration with prof. Also they actually calculate emotions like math homework and how a computer recognize the subtle facial movements we humans use to express , and how we feel. The computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the faces. And the facil expressions for each emotion are universal, observes Dr. Huang. Even though individuals often show varying degrees of expression like not smiling as broadly. With Mona Lisa demonstration is really intended to bring a smile to your face, while it shows just how much the computer can do. They are 3 things while you are looking in the mirror 1 is raise your lips at the comers of your mouth, 2 is squinting yours eyes slightly, to produce wrinkling at the comers of your eyes and 3 is holding that raise the outer parts of your cheeks up. Towars your eyes. The facial feedback theory of emotion, moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions, but also may even help produce them. Empathy feeling someone else's emotional state may happen because we unconsciously imitate another person's facial expressions. All that is about science or technology. 
392	In the second sentance of the fourth paragraph it explains that astronomers are curious because it may have been the most Earth like planet in our solar system. The planet resembles a surface with rocky sediment and includes things such as valleys, mountains, and craters.  In the fifth paragraph it states that NASA is coming up with possible solutions to avoid most of these issues. One of them is inventing is a small vehical that resembles a blimp floating 30 miles above Venus's landscape.  
393	opinions, 
394	I feel like people think it good to have for them self i feel like we should get it because a lot of human perform this impressive  calclulation  everyday because you can probably tell how friend is feeling simply by look on her face. 
395	The single best argument against the electoral collage is what might be what we (the american people) might call the disastor factor, We should consdier ourselves lucky that in the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a centry; the system can allow much worse. Back in 1960, segregationists in the Lousiana legislature nearly succeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy. (So that a popular vote for kennedy would not have actually gone to Kennedy)   Faithless  electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party's canidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please. Perhaps most worrying is the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote, In that case, the election would be thrown to the House of Representives. Where state deleations vote on the president, and the senate would choose the vice-president. At the most basic level, he electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winner-take-all system in each state.  Canidates dont spend time in states they know they have no chance of winnning, focusing only on the tight races in the  swing  states. During the 2000 campain, seventeen sates didnt see the canidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didnt get to see a campain ad. If anyone has a good argument for putting the fate of the presidency in the hands of a few swing voters in Ohio, they have yet to make it... Originally the founding fathers estabished the electoral college in the Constitutuin as a compromise between election of the president by a vote in congress but i believe that the electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational! Some of the best arguments in favor of it are mostly assertions without much basis in reality 
396	but that doesn't mean that also doesn't mean that it might do a lot of things right either. 
397	I am truely appreciative of what you have done for my state, our city, and to help the country in so many ways that can not be explained. 
398	For example, if one thing in the electoral college is gone, then the whole thing may be affected by it. Also if theres no Electoral College then they wouldn't be any electors to select from and no counting of the electoral votes by congress. 
399	if we Electoral College vote it would be harder for us to vote. 
400	i know that i am very highly over them in academics and especially all sports. I bet i will go to a d1 university hopefully at NOTRE DAME for a starting wide receiver or cornerback position. In order to go to that prestigious d1 university you have to have a 4.2 gpa and a hell of a top football player in the country. 
401	the single best argument against the electrol collages.  they would call it the disaster factor the reason for that is the american people should consider them self lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century ; the system allows much worse, consider that states legislaturs are technically responsible for picking electors, and that those electors i   could always defy the will of the people.  proving my point making the peoples votes useless. 
402	The reason I think that the voting regulations is broken is that smaller states like Rhoad Island is a state that gets 3-10 votes and Claifonia gets 55 votes. If the only thing that make people happy is to be heard by the bigger people in life. If you where a 18 year old kid in a small state trying to make a  new product that could help millions but your in that state that wont let you be heard by the rest of the country.    
403	Advantages include 
404	The Electoral college is one by far the best things, It dont need to be taken from us. Many good things the college does. 
405	As you can see the Electoral College is really selfish. 
406	On the other hand i think making us students do community service because if the high school students or maybe middle school student decide to tutor elementary , the education will MOST LIKELY make progress 
407	So please think about this opportunity and please let this be aloud. 
408	Do you remember a time you hated cleaning you house?  Well if people hate doing that imagine them doing community service and how that don't have air conditioning like a house do its outside in the hot sunny day and just have water to drink sweet coming down your face. 
409	Five reasons why the Electora College should be restained despite its lack of democratic.  The winners takes all bases . What is that, why would we use that. In 2012 President Obama received 61.7% of the electoral votes compared to only 51.3% of the popular votes cast for him and Romney, says in source 3: In defence of the Electoral College. My point here is that we  DO NOT  need the Elecoral College. The voters in presidential elections are people who wants to express a  political preference rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election. 
410	Another big one is the people you talk to about your decisions. 
411	If we are being logical here we know that the pyrimads were created by humans them selves but do really think an alien could have done this? We do not think so because they are just not as smart and and not as equpit as a human is. We think that it was a land form God decided to give the planet. 
412	Why have so much going on when you can peacefully just count the votes of the voters and electors together? 
413	The dont need away getting nowhere if its online classes. 
414	The last source for the story talks about the defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President. Electoral College is widely regared as an anachronism and a non-democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be [overruled] by declasring the candidate who receives the most popular votes the winner. The advocatesos this postion are coorect in arguing that the Electoral College method is not democratic in a modern sense ... it is the electors who elect the president, not the people. Your votes for a presidential candidate your're actually voting for a slate of electors. There are a selects of parties that a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee.         
415	So then again maybe we should do community service. 
416	I believe that we American citizens should be able to vote. Our votes should all matter. We as a nation are one. One vote we all should be able to vote. 
417	The Mona lisa demonstration really intended to bring a smile to your face this while just imagine how a computer knows when you're happy or sad thats crazy. For example, if you smile as soon as a web ad appears on the screen another ad will follow. Lets say that you frown the next ad will be different from the one you smiled on. Another thing a classroom computer can know when students are becoming to be confused or bored.  How the start of the porcess is when the computer contracts a 3-D computer model of the face all of the 44 major muscles on the model must have move like human muscles. Eckamn has classified six emotions for example anger, surprise, fear, sadness and happiness. Movement for more than one muscle is called a unit.  In fact us human perfrom this impressive called calculation we use it everyday. For example, you could tell how your friend is feeling by looking at his or her face. most us would have trouble describing each others facial trit that makes us happy or worried. Yet Dr. Huang observes artist like Leonardo Da Vinci he studied human anatomy to help them paint facial muscles to have enough convey specific type of emoitions. 
418	Second of all people who favored the seperation of race. 
419	The Electoral College in the other hand, allows votes from states to be made. It is an easier method to get the states to vote for the president, and it takes less time. 
420	Many people also agree with me because according to source 2 it says that in case of the election it will be thrown to the House of Representatives where the delegations vote on the president. This way the delegation people can pick who's good for president. 
421	Al Gore won the popular vote but lost the presidency, over sixty percent would perfer a direct vote than have the elctoral college vote also. The vote could be very close even if one candidate wins by much in the popular vote due to the presidency vote. If there was a tie in the electoral vote the election would be thrown to the House of Represenstatives. Instead of all that work if there was only a popular vote it would be quick and simple. 
422	They probly ask more than 1 person becuase they want to see what different answer they can get. They also may becuase they might have a problem going on and don't know what to do and ask for help and advice. They also may be in a serious siuwation and need advice badly to make their next more. 
423	I feel like if you take an online class you have a greater chance of pasting to the next grade than me. I have an good and bad response to online classes. In an online class you have no consequences like student's in school have. Online classes is unique because you do what you want when you want. 
424	Luke crossed the Atlantic Ocean sixteen times and the Pacific Ocean twice, to help countries recover their food supplies, animals, and much more as it says in paragraph two. Even though it was a long journey across the oceans and the waters were rough 
425	because a computer that can read all 44 major muscles, and also this is where FACS will come in (Facial Action Coding System.) 
426	Well once again here is why i do agree and don't agree. i agree becuase it make scence that out of nowhere there is an unkown figure of a face on mars, but at the same time we do not know who did it. So we jump top conclusions that it ahd to be an ailen . But we have nop prrof that an alien is rwal and we have no proof that any of thid is real. 
427	Each passage has its own main part about Venus, however, it will tallk about the challenge that are face in Venus 
428	First and foremost the Electoral College is very old. 
429	People always seem to argue about this Electoral College, we calll it a disastor factor. 
430	and now there making technology that reads emotional expressions. 
431	The electoral college makes sure that no canidate recieves a maajority of the votes cast 
432	For projects with the intentions to keep students learning while on summer break the first issue would be students making projects on subjects that have no relevance to school, this would be very inefficient in the efforts made by school boards to keep students learning. 
433	But some students don't have phones, so don't think to hard about this 
434	this invention could fix so many problems that we have today. 
435	I feel like this type of technology has no purpose what so ever.  
436	not alot of people wanna know why she was sad this isnt from the artlicle nobody cares about why she was sad or happy leave her be what kind of test is this who the heck is gunna ask you what the heck happened in the passed its the passed it should stay there nobody in the world is gunna ask you what mood was mona lisa in in the picture who the heck cares its in the passed i didnt have to go into the artlicle to know this is stupid make fun of me if you please if someones reading this sure if its the computer when what the heck computer slide me a dub on this test me and you both know this isnt something will be asked in the future honestly tho who cares this is nonsense whos to really know if u were happy or sad or the picture was actually there to make u smile thats like me saying im here to be loyal then say im gunna cheat instead. you were not there to say that it was there for that one certin purpose no personal information but me and my girl arent together so that isnt my girl so i could lie and say she cheated or i can tell the truth n say she left cus i wasnt making her happy 
437	You might see students walking around school thinking about sports or other activities ,and that will be the only thing that they will be having on their mind. 
438	 Each candidate running for President is your state has his or her own group of electors  (5).  The electors are generally chosen by the candidate's political party, but state laws vary on how the electors are selected and what their responsibilities are...  (5). 
439	With kids having to have a B average and over all these years you would just have to have a C average, it would just mess everything up 
440	The advantages of limiting car usage 
441	This is what i think Lukes point of view for convincing people to come. 
442	Secondly, the Electoral College is very confusing for a voter who doesnt know how it works.   
443	the author want to show you all the data he picked up good and bad. 
444	Okay to end my letter, my con conclustion is that this is my letter to my state seator 
445	different perspectives 
446	That would be bad so the there are PROS and CONS about having phones at schools. 
447	the reason why i dont belive aliens are real beacuse i never heard one i never saw one with my own eyes and i also said the face dont look nothing like a alien. 
448	At the end of the artcle, the author finally mentions his viewpoint on the subject.  But during the actual article, it is not once mentioned that we should go to Venus. 
449	what if someone is fake smiling. is your technology going to be able to tell if your really happy or not? I think it not a good idea because one it doesnt tell you all the emotions that the person is feeling and what if the person doesnt want one or doesnt like it and they aloud ti get rid of it or do they have to keep it. I know i wouldnt want someone else to tell me my emotions so i surely dont want some technology telling me how i feel . 
450	i think he was like showing people and telling people about its so fun 
451	you go travel on the boat ride home and back but, you don't have to go sit around and watch from the boat. When you get off the boat you have a reward. If you like to see stuff like Europe, Italy, China, Greece then you'll love it. If you don't believe me ask Luke he's the one whos been to all those places. He said that the boat trips were so unbelievable for a small town boy like him.  
452	it would beneficial to them because people would be giving more money to them to try and find the aliens. this is yet another reason why it's not aliens 
453	Phones can interrupt many thing like dinner with family or study time for a big test that is coming up. 
454	Well I really think you should give us a try and see if it works but if it do it could or maybe stay that way. but I really think you should give us students a try and see if we can listen to the rules that u provided to us about our cell phones. and I know some of these students listen and some don't but if u try maybe something will work out for you and us students. 
455	When people ask for advice is because they want to know what things are better like to buy. 
456	ONE OF THE TINGS THAT IS WRONG WITH IT IS  UNDER THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE SYSTEM , VOTERS VOT NOT FOR PRESIDENT, BUT FOR A SLATE OF ELECTOERS, WHO IT Turn elect the president.  
457	And those kids with disorders might love sports or other activities, and you are keeping them away from that. Wouldn't you feel bad knowing you would be taking away something that other people love to do. 
458	The new software can make 3-D models based off your face, to be able to do this software need to have fine accuracy. the software could identify humans emotions, but should be used in some cases. As in making computer-animated faces more expressive for video games or video surgery. 
459	Because if aliens were to make that face on Mars then that means they seen NASA's cameras circling their planet so they would've found a way to get them down. But I think it's a big pain in the butt to the people that think thier is alien life on a planet in our Solier System 
460	Using this tecnology is valuable because anatomy to allowed them paint facial muscles precisely enough to convey specific emotions. to how it's going to work on the compter. It's valuable because it can tell how Mona Lisa demontrates is really intended to bring a smile. 
461	Sometimes on the news there is either an accident or a suicide. It might involve someone not looking where they're going or tweet that someone sent. It either injury or death. If a mysterious number says I'm going to kill you and they know where you live but you don't know the person's contact ,It makes you puzzled and make you start to freak out. Which can end up really badly. 
462	Having good guidelines and being told what the expectations are will give students a better chance at success. 
463	The face on mars was a pictures that the vikings took from 1976. When vikings were snapping pictures of possible landing sites for its sister ship viking two. So we already know that there were pepole on mars before so they might of built the face on mars. 
464	The text explain correcthy each factor that Venus has, it also explain with details what are the dangers that being on Venus presents. 
465	After voting in the election the governor makes a  Certificate of Ascertainment,  which is the list of the candidates who ran for presidant. Also, it shows who the winning candidate is in each state. Lastly the certificate is sent to the states congress to keep for records. 
466	Popular vote don't seem to matter, The Peoples vote don't seem to matter. 
467	Plus what would it hurt ? its not a painless unnoticable process that helps the students get a better education 
468	Another reason is  Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication.  
469	But if I'm the scientist trying to figured out all this work,and see who's the human face or a alien face because humans on earth an aliens in Mars or more planets. But afterwards after that happening, it saids how some people think the Face is bona fide evidence of life on Mars evidence that NASA would rather hide, say conspiracy theorists. Meanwhile the defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an acient civilization on Mars. Also, although few scientists believed the Face was an alien artifact photographing Cydonia became a prioprity for NASA when Global Surveyor arrived at the Red Planet in September. 1997, eighteen long years ago after the Viking missions ended. 
470	I'm stil shocked that people think they're real. I've never seen one before 
471	i can connect this by simply looking at the picture and back couple years and to now how scientist reported no life for is on mars you will be boiled to death because it's also no oxygen so how can an alien create a face when no life form have been found yet. 
472	By students getting the chance to try new things they could step out of their comfort zone and get the chance to explore new talents. Within students exploring new things they gain knowlege and gain more expreince on ther project. 
473	i think if they were to put a cerfui on driving out at night time less bad stuff would happen let me explain my self. If i somthing were to happen to me like getting kid naped  and i dont retuen home by 3;30 yor gona knoe somthing is wrong and maybe it might even save my life.  then our goverment could make money by giving us tickets but hopefully its not a lot because ufortuanetly not every one has a little cash in there pockets like some of us do.  If in case it past the curfui and u need to get home you could just walk home or have the cops take you home beause all cops are free taxis. If you didnt know. its aslo totaly free. cops arnt just here to give you tickets. 
474	Venus a friend to earth and the closest to earth than any other planet. The density ,size are mostly the same, Venus,Mars is earth neightbor, orbit the sun at different,hottest planet. 
475	It shows you how much a computer can do. The computer knows when you are sad and happy. It's like a dog knowing when you are upset or happy. 
476	Venus has conditions that are far more extreme than anything humans can encounter on Earth 
477	Human curiosity is leading us to find more knowledge of our sister planet.   
478	it is chosen by a better educated person. 
479	Now that they Electoral votes are being distubuted evenly there is a smaller problem we face. Electors are the people who actully vote for our presidential canidate. Very rarely do these electors not choose the canidate based on the amount of votes they have been given, but it does happen. The electors are in a way chosen randomly but most of the time are chosen by the presidential canidate. Often these canidates do the right thing and vote based on votes gifen to him by the public 
480	i think we can help this community by helping,clean,stop littering and start helping everyone so that this world can live longer then the outher worlds did 
481	The Electoral College is widely regareded as an anachronism. but each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vte for he party's nominee. certainty of outcome is like percentage . the winner takes all basically.  
482	Finally, yes the technology is worth a big margin but its worth to have the help we can all get to help us know many. 
483	There are many things that can benefit from community service, there are also many things that can not be beneficial. 
484	I will be talking to you about how scientist's are thinking of putting things on the planet Venus and i wll also talk to you the fasinated thing our planet Venus has to offer. 
485	Paris enforces a driving ban to clear the air of the global city. Motorist with numbered licensed plates were ordered to leave their cars at there house or pay a fine of 31$. For this enforces over 4,000 drivers were fined. More than 20 peoplae got theit cars impounded for their reaction to the fine of paris. Diesel fuel company was blamed since France has a tax policy that favors diesel  over gasoline. Diesel fuel company makes up 67% of vehicles in France. For this kind of behavior Delivery companies complained for loss of buisness.  
486	in the text it states- twenty five years ago something funny happened around Mars. 
487	Everyone needs assistance every now and then. Like when you fall and someone helps you up, they are assisting you. One time I was on a board at my house and I fell off and broke my leg, but my friend was there and he carried me to the house. He assisted me by helping me to the house. 
488	Some students in the Twenty-First Century are not willing to learn about certain topics in school because of all the other amazing internet resources and games they think are part of computer freedom, but inspite of Three- Dimentinal vision, Mona Lisa could have been much angrier than what she might have seemed like in her face, and she might have been fearful because of her hair style and her looks  in the dark!  Maybe, there was a possibility that a demostration of Mona Lisa could test how well with a(n) computer with  2020 Vision Software , or have a(n) emotional sensor flashdrive to attach to your PC Engine when you want there to be certain conducting over feelings from your computer technology 
489	Being kicked out of school can be good or bad. 
490	Even when these children are done with their homework they have free time and have the choice on what to do, which usually leads to T.V., video games, eating, computer... exedra. I think if these few extra hours lead to sports, it would be okay. If kids take the time and put in the effort to fit in sports and schooling in one schedule, I think that everything would be great 
491	As the author talks about in paragaph 8 it says, Been tested in a chamber simulation the chaos of Venus.   This meaning to this is how many things had been tested and seen. Therefore they are dicovering new stuff in this century 
492	Selecting the Electors,the meeting for the president and vice president,and the counting of electoral votes by congress is a better idea than 60 percent of voters  prefering a direct election to kind we have now. I understand that under the  Electoral College system,voters vote not for the president but for a slate of electors,who turn elect the president. If you lived in texas for instance and wanted to vote for john kerry you'd vote for a slate of 34 democratic electors pledged to kerry,On the off-chance that those electors won the statewide election they would go to congress and kerry would get 34 lectoral votes. Each candidate running for president in your state has his or her own group of electors. The electors are generally chosen by the candidates,s political party, but state laws vary on how the electors are selected and what their reponsibilities are. At the most basic level the  Electoral College is unfair to voters because of the winner take all system in each state,canidatdes dont spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning.  Election by popular vote for the president of the  United States  Obama received 61.7 percent of the electoral votes compared to only 51.3 percent of the popular votes cast for him and romney becausw almost all states award electoral votes on a winner take all basis even a very slight plurality in a state creates a landslide electoral vote victory in that state. A tie in a nationwide electoral vote is possible because the total number of votes 538 is an even number,but it is highly unlikely but each party selcts a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee it is entirely possible that the winner of the electoral vote will not win the national popular vote. Yet that has happened very rarely. It happened in 2000, when Gore had more popular votes than bush yet fewer electoral votes,but that was the first time since 1888 thats happened. there are five reasons for reraining the electoral college despite its lackof democratic pedigree all practical reasons not liberal or conservative reasons. A disput ove routcome of an electoral college vote is possible it happened in 2000 but it's less likley than a dispute over the popular vote. 
493	Now it is possible for somebody to secretly change the names that way but it is a higher stake, or risk to take not having the Electoral College. 
494	No one knows how the face changes, maybe it's aliens, maybe it's natrual to change, maybe it's getting older. 
495	Sometimes the votes get overulled by the popular vote. The electors really only focus on the swing states. That`s just not right at all. 
496	It's kind of like when you're at a crossroads.  You and someone else get there at the same time.  They're to your right, so they have the right of way and can go first.  It doesn't matter that you got there at the same exact time, or even if you're going somewhere more important than where they're going.  It's like that with the election.  The Electoral College and the state may both be voting, but the Electoral College has the  right of way  and has more importance over us, whether they care who they're voting for or not. 
497	Sightseeing is something that can make you glad you toke up the job. The things you could see are things that you probably won't see at home. These sights can also teach you something about the country 
498	It's really sad when you think about it, people have developed skills and strategies to make it look like they're not on the phone. 
499	children in our school have the knowledge to know when community service should be done
