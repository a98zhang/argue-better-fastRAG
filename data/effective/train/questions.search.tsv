0	though some say that life on Mars does exist, I think that there is no life on Mars. 
1	"The process begins when the computer puts together a 3-D digital model. There are 44 major muscles in your face that the computer has to detect. Eckman classified six emotions happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. He then "" associated each with characteristic movements of facial muscles.""  For example the frontalis pars lateralis muscle is above your eye which shows your surpried when it is raised.  Us humans alone can identify facial expressions on peoples faces. If you look at a friend you can tell how they are feeling at that moment. Da Vinci studied human anatomy to help paint the facial muscles percisely on the Mona Lisa painting. Dr. Huangs has new computer software it stores similar info as electronic code. He thinks there could be a different type of code to the painting.  "
2	Ads can be good for promotion of products, but i think we all know when your playing a game on your electronic device that you want to keep playing or watching and not the ad. 
3	well it is not. 
4	Well to start off the technology has decoded the Mona Lisa smile 
5	You know they one the smile that seams somewhat omanis when you look at it. well this program has determend that the paintings famous smile is mostly happy. The spcifics of the smile are as follows she's 83 precent happy, 9 precent disgusted, 6 precent fearful, and 2 precent angry. This computer software known as the FACS looks adn all 44 major mussles and then makes a decison based on that. How can this be helpfull to schools. 
6	NASA on the other hand and says there is likelyness of a human face. They also believe it is an alien artifac 
7	According to the picture they say because of the shadows it portraies eyes, nose and mouth. They say that in the years that they took the picture it has developed more and more over the spands of years.  
8	There are many sides to people giving up their cars. Some people are truly happy and some are not. It may not be that bad, i mean how did people manige before cars were even invented 
9	President Obama has done nothing to improve our society.Â  If anything, he has created the worst society this world has ever seen.  
10	After reading the article I really could'nt decide. When reading about the FACS the first thing that came to my mind was to use this technology on the faces of celeberties. 
11	Sure the teacher could use this technology to teach students about how advanced the humans have become but.. 
12	This reminds me of disecting frogs in biology. Some students think it's useful for your education while some other students think it's a waste of time, a waste of life for the frogs and that disecting them in the first place is already digusting. But do they do this for fun. NO they don't. They do it to learn about the oragns of the frogs and the purpose of each organ. But is disecting frogs valuable? Yes in my opinion. 
13	"The study the ability of humans to read subatle changesin facial expressions, thast they appiled reverse correlation technique to reveal visual features that mediate understanding of emotion expressed by the face. Suprising finding were that (1) the noise added to test face image had profound effect on the facail expression and (2) in most every istance the new expression was meaningful.  All 44 major muscles in the mode must move like human muslces. Movemment of one or more mucles is called an ""action unit"" Then Dr. Pual Eckam, creator of (FACS) Ekman has classified six basic emotions- happeniess, suprise, anger, disgust, feat and sadness. In the text it states,""The soft wear is the latest innovatiobn from Prof. Thomas Huang, of the Beckman Institiute for Advance Science at the University of  Illinois."" Dr. Huag and colleague are experts at developing better ways fo humans and computers to communicate. The faical expressions for each emotion are univeral, observers Dr. Huang, even thought individuals often show varying degrees of expression (like smiling broadly). Using video imagery, the new emotion-recqizing softwear facture these movements.  The study the ability of humans to read subatle changesin facial expressions, thast they appiled reverse correlation technique to reveal visual features that mediate understanding of emotion expressed by the face. The process begins whwne the computer constructs a 3-D comupter Model. "
14	The Mona lisa demonstration really intended to bring a smile to your face this while just imagine how a computer knows when you're happy or sad thats crazy. For example, if you smile as soon as a web ad appears on the screen another ad will follow. Lets say that you frown the next ad will be different from the one you smiled on. Another thing a classroom computer can know when students are becoming to be confused or bored.  How the start of the porcess is when the computer contracts a 3-D computer model of the face all of the 44 major muscles on the model must have move like human muscles. Eckamn has classified six emotions for example anger, surprise, fear, sadness and happiness. Movement for more than one muscle is called a unit.  In fact us human perfrom this impressive called calculation we use it everyday. For example, you could tell how your friend is feeling by looking at his or her face. most us would have trouble describing each others facial trit that makes us happy or worried. Yet Dr. Huang observes artist like Leonardo Da Vinci he studied human anatomy to help them paint facial muscles to have enough convey specific type of emoitions. 
15	"In the article ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"", it tals about how scientest are working on new technology to overcome the chalanges of Venus and its complications. "
16	In the begining of the artical it talks abou how Venus isthe second closest planet from the sun and how it is one of the two most similar planets to Earth. Since it has similarities to Earths' size and density scientest have sentunmanded spacecrafts to Venus to investigate.  Unfortunatlly no space craft has survived acording to the last two sentances of paragraph two. In the beginning of paragraph three it states how a thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent of carbon dioxide engulfs Venus. The clouds on this planet are also highly currosive with sulfuric acid in them. The planets surface averages about 800 degrees Fahrenheit and the atmospheric presure is 90 times greater than on Earth. This concludes that Venus has the hotest surface tempreature of any planet in our solar system. Venus also has obsticals like erupting valcanos, earthquakes, and frequent lightning stikes on the planets surface. 
17	In the second sentance of the fourth paragraph it explains that astronomers are curious because it may have been the most Earth like planet in our solar system. The planet resembles a surface with rocky sediment and includes things such as valleys, mountains, and craters.  In the fifth paragraph it states that NASA is coming up with possible solutions to avoid most of these issues. One of them is inventing is a small vehical that resembles a blimp floating 30 miles above Venus's landscape.  
18	Now this doesn't get the scientest what they want exactly what they want 
19	because due to the planets atmospher light doesn't peneatrate very well making it difficult to observe ground conditions. It also limits the amount that you would see in pictures and vidoes of the planet. Many researchers are working on new inventions so macheines will last longer on the harsh planet.  For example in the seventh paragraph NASA states that it has been working on electronics made of silicon carbon and they have even tested it a chamber concluding that it lasted in the harsh conditions for three weeks. They are also recyclaling old ideas from the 1800's, they are trying to use a computor that does calculations,but theinvention uses gears and levers, meaning that it doesn't require any electricity to work. 
20	Scientest are working hard to accheve this goal to explore this harsh mystery planet. They accept the challanges that come with it and they strive to succeed not only to gain insight but to quench their curiosity that all humans have about this planet and the possibilities that it could lead to.  
21	I think that the principal should not decided that every single gosh darn student should do an extracurricular activity. 
22	And you get to see how this world changed from a war. And how people are doing in their new home that was maybe was distroed. And when you do help you see how the people are happy and so thankful for you help with supplies. So they can now live again with some comfort.           
23	When you are using your cell phone while driving, you're doing all three types which are manual, visual, and cognitive. 
24	Teens and adults spend most of their time on their cellular devices. They are either on social media or texting. Nobody gets on the phone anymore its all about texting now 
25	so students can study and understand how the artist felt when he or she painted on the canvis. 
26	"paragraph 1 said ""She's 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry."";and how we know that? you may ask. The FACS ""Dr. Huang relies on the work of psychologists, such as Dr. Paul Eckman, creator of FACS"" witch was stated in paragrah 3; they said all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles and when moving of one or more muscles is called an action unit. "
27	"Paragraph 4 said ""The facial expressions for each emotion are universal"" and that means every you move your expressions change. They also gave an example they said like not smiling as broadly. They can move and mix emotions in da vinci's masterpiece witch the Mona Lisa useing the FACS. Dr. Huang's new computer software cantanes similar anatomical information as electronic code. "
28	"In the passage it says,"" According to Facial Feedback Theory of Emotion, moving your facial muscles not only expreess emotions, but also may even help produce them. (""Putting on a happy face"" actually works!)"". This proves that it has been proven by experts that this system could help spread positive vibes. ""Whoever thought that making faces could receal so much about the science of emotions!"". "
29	Which further proves his point how valuable it is to study Venus. 
30	There are many issues going on in the world, much worse than trying to figure our expressions. So, why aren't we using this tchnology, and these smart people to work on something more important? Imagine a computer that knows when you're happy or sad, what would you need it for 
31	Venus is a very dangrus planet its ben proven, not one human has lasted more than a few hours floating above the fray,its been more than three decades since a space ship has tuched venus but 
32	scientist are till working on the planert wonderingthe same question as you why are we still working on this dangerus planet 
33	well scientist come to notice that venus has some familiar featurs alike earth it has vallys, mountains,and craters, scientist have come to think that long time ago, venus was probably coverd with oceans and could have suppoted various forms of life, just like earth today., thats why scientists are not giving up on figuring out venus witch is why they are still trying to go back to venus safe and scientificly productive following the safe orders that NASA gave the scientist, NASA gave sicentist permission to go to venus with some conditions,they will only be allowed to be floating above the fry, scientist will have to invent a stronger space ship, and they will have to study not just the planet but the people more so it can be safer and they dont have any risks. not to mention venusis the closest to earth in terms of desity and size, and occasionatly the closest to didtance too its the second planet from our sun known as erths twin. 
34	There are many limiting car usage, through out the world, 
35	Attention !!! to all the residents of this community are Bendz and Suburban going were all the extoic cars and muscle cars at all i see bendz and suburban, Its few foreigen cars out there in the street. when I riding on the highway I like to see Mustangs and And Lamborginis ride aside if me because its excited other people it make them want to buy Mustangs and Lamborginis.  Yes Bendz are nice but i want to see some foreiegn cars Like Bugati and RoyalRoce 50% you will see foreiegn ride around in the city I like to take a trip to see al type of cars with nice paint job and nice looking skirt. You will not see that much cars riding around because people sell them to live in beautyful homes. In 2007 all the streets was full with muscle cars because the rapper Rick Ross was the first person drive a drop top mustang so many people was so excited thats i seen the whole streets with differnt type of mustangs and drop tops.  In the early 90's thats when automobile was invented,Â  they really was made for middle-class families and Miami to Tallahassee Because it was alot of people thst need gas and lights when the hurricane came through.12 percents of huge houses gas emission in Chicago... and up 72 percent cars-invented area in the united states while they building cars some people has catch buses.  It has been efforts in the past two years to make denser and better for walking in 2010 that's when stationwagins was invented so people really did have to walk anymore or catch buses but some catch buses because it save gas and money. In the united states the protection agency is promoting car reduced communities and legislators are starting to act.  every since world war I alot of cars was getting destroy lets stop destory cars because thats our transportation said Martin Luther King jr, a fast growing of hundreds in the united states was getting larger and the car population more foreiegn cars and mucle cars was hitting the streets.       Â        Â     
36	they will be involved in their school 
37	they will make friends 
38	they could enjoy it. 
39	Students should always feel involved in their school. 
40	Another issue is what if parents can't pick up their child? 
41	Knowing that Venus is a whole planet the size of earth and only getting to see just a tiny bit of it is like starting at one side of the United States and then driving only a few hours to see how far you get, If you are trying to go all the way around the world to get back to the same spot but only have a few hours to do so, you don't cover much of anything to have any real say of how the world looks in different areas if you haven't seen it all yet. 
42	Do you think it would be valuble to use the Facial Action Coding System is a technolgy that read your emotions and read it off with a percentige here is an example as it says in th first pargraph she is 83 percent happy.9 percent disguested,6 percent fearfull,and 2 percent angry. The process of the FACS is th computer constructs a 3-D model of the face all 44 major muscles in the model must move like hummans muscle's. 
43	"Dr. Huang relies on his work for pschologist such as Dr. Paul Eckman creator of FACS Eckman has classiflied 6 basic emotions such as happpnies,surpise,anger,disgust,fear, and sadness. Anf then associted with characteristic's movemnet's for ecample your frontails pars latrerails muscle's raises your eyebrows when you're surpirsed your'r orbiuclas oris tight your lips up show anger.  ""The Facial expression for each are univesal""' obsevers Dr. Huang ""even ttrough indivduals ofeten show carry's degree of expression like not smiling as brodly well using a video, in a real life face or in a paiting by weighinh the diffent units the software can even identfy mixed emotions as in Da vincis master pice each expression is compared to a neutral face. "
44	The challeange of exploring venus  Study venus is a pursuit to dangers, Venus is the challenging planet to humans because of the diffculties. 
45	we can also make this planet our planetary,  
46	venus is one of the most challenging exploring planet on the slolar system.  if we can find a way to overcome this challenges we should be able to over come all other planet on the solar system challegings this we dont have to worry about this earth twin to affect our own earth. 
47	"Another reason that the author wrote in the text was in paragraph 2 it states, ""Ofter reffered to as Earth's 'Twin,' Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size, and occasionally the closest in distance too. "
48	In the future the facial recognizer might be able to replace teachers. 
49	The idea is still to far off because the system , still doesn't understand that most human comunications are none verbal. The system could help solve crimes and other things it would be able to recognize if a person is lying or not by their facial expresions. 
50	Humans perfom the same amount of emotions everyday. 
51	but that's not the question,the question was do I agree with it? No I don't. 
52	it'll help people avdanced experiment in low-car suburban life but its basic precepts are being adopted around the world 
53	attempts to make suburbs more compact and more accessible to public transportation with less parking space in this new approach stores are far away to walk to on a main street rather than in small malls around some distant highway 
54	Though they have tested many new products in chambler ith simlar climate to venus finding new ways to hopefully find more out about Venus. 
55	lastly the author also talks about how Venus most likely had life on the planet similar to that of earths 
56	scientist are interested in finding out more about this even though many dangers are included in this task. Finding new ways to make sysems in which can be sent to Venus is difficult but found early computers with physical componets might be the key to their succsess in finding out avout Venus past.  
57	Some people might think it should be teacher based 
58	This will also give them a chance on choosing what style of what of project they want. They could do it on paper or poster or power point and many more. Students coud also base it off of the schedule they have or the days that are free. 
59	"Luke joined the program. He decided to because his freiend offered it to him.  Also it was a once and a lifetime opportunity for him. He kenw he couldn't past up the opportunity. Luke also joined because he wanted to help people after World War ll.  Some evidence that Luke want to go to the program is? Luke want to go on the ship back and forth from the oceans. Also Luke could be drafted in the miliatry service because he turned 18. Luke said ""The cattle-boat trip were an unbelievable opportunity for a small-town boy."" Also it took about two weeks to cross the Atlantic Ocean from the eastern coast of the united states and a month to get to China.  The conclussion to the story is? Luke want to join the program. Some evidence that Luke said is ""I'm grateful for the opportunity."" Also Luke said ""It made me more aware of people of there countries and their needs.""  Finally Luke said that the awareness stayed with him. Which help leading his family to host a number of international students and exchange visitors for many years. "
60	They are sayin how to detect other people feeling. How other people feel. The software of some new computer that recognize emotions. Can they like calculate emotions like math homework 
61	i think they can not calculate emotions like a math homework. 
62	Your frontalis pars lateralis muscle above your eyes raises your eyebrows when you're surpised your orbicularis oris around your mouth tightens your lip to show anger. The facial expressions for each emotion are universal. They would have trouble actually describing each facial trait that conveys happy worried etc.  Computers know when your happy or sad if you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen a similar ad might follow but if you frown the next ad will be different. Most human communication is nonverbal inculding emotional communication so computers need to know that to. You can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face. A computer animated faces more expressive for video games or video surgery.  According to the facial feedback theory of Emotion moving your facial emotions, but also may even help produce them. Putting on a happy face actually works a renowned drama coach had his actors carefully reproduce smiling and frowning as a way of creating these emotions on stage. Whoever thought that making faces could reveal so much about the science of emotions. 
63	How would you feel if you had to be on the basketballÂ team but you don't even like basketball? 
64	Students want to get out of stressful school, and go home, but the extracurricular activitie abolishes that opportunity.  
65	and it wouldn't be facing towards the sky, it would be like a statue, plus it would have been a really fantastic descovery and we would try to make contact with the martians and see how they live and survive on the planet so we could possibly live there one day. NASA would send space crafts and rovers to Mars so we could study the creatures. Finding out how to survive on mars and the other planets is important and is something humans should learn how to do just in case if something happens to earth and we aren't able to go back to it. 
66	Many people at NASA want wanted that to be a statue or something that a living creaturs has made, but as you see in the pictures it starts to look more like a natural cause of natural cause. 
67	I'm Luke Bomberger I am part of the Seagoing Cowboys program. 
68	you do a lot of activities such as baseball, vollyball, table-tennis, fencing, boxing, reading and, whittling on the way back. You play the games where the animals used to be. 
69	It's a life changing opportunity. I'm very gratefull I have that opportunity. It made me more aware of the countries in need and that awareness has always sayed with me. 
70	That is why I think you should join the Seagoing Cowboys program. 
71	Theory of Emotion, moving your facial muscles not only expresses emothins, but it also may help produce them 
72	You can feel other peoples emotional. it may happen becasue they unconsciously imitate another person's facial expression 
73	A extracurricular activity is a great way to kill time. 
74	the author article about studying venus is good. My opnion is that we should study Venus because that can be a good thing for us 
75	So if im angry im most likely will have a negative vibe and if you put something up that is close to be negative its not going to make me happy. If I am in a good mood more than likely I would not want to see no Ad. Then there expression is compared against a neutral face, some people just look naturally mad. If some one regular face looks mad then how would it read ther face then, that person could be happy. 
76	"It says ""moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions, but also may even help produce them''. I think that is very true and hopefully it would make people more happy and not feel like they are nothing.  "
77	You try to make the other person try to guess your emotion and the computer would tell you if they got it right or not 
78	Disagree 
79	some people can not do some thing like some people can not do sports like working want people some work just there self some teacher don't do activity the principal don't why should the student do some just not that good what. 
80	It good to play do activiy but it a lot thing to do outside have fun or some we young sports is fun to but no one want to be and a hot gym half of the day out of energy when you get home you get home you going want to go to bed going to want to eat and sleep that it now activty a lot eat and sleep that it now activty a lot of work some don't like now who want sit after scool to do some workÂ  
81	I support Lukes claims because they are very useful for the activty that he is duing 
82	"Mona Lisa Smile she is 83 percent happy,9 percent disgusted,6 percent fearful, and 2 percent anger. Mona Lisan Smile her emotional is less because here happy is hight and not low. She have being sad but she have being mad. Her anger was 2 percent that is less. She have more emotional smiling. But she have a little fearful. Mona Lisa Smile at last according to the some new computer software that can recognize her emotions. Thomas Huang, ge tge beckmqn institute for Advanced Science at the University of lllinois, working in collaboration with the Prof. Nicu sebe he are the Universitycof tge Amsterdam. Dr. Huang and his colleague are experts at the developing vetter ways for the human and computers to communicate. And they was talking about the calulate emotions like a math homework? and how can they computers the recongnize of the subtle facial movements. And they have the humans use to express how we feel. And they was staring making comuter constructs a 3-D computer nodel of the face; all the 44 major muscles in the model must move like a human muscles. And movement of the one more muscles is called an""action unit."" Than Dr. Huang relies on the work of psychologists, as Dr. Paul Eckman, creator of tge FACS ( Facial Action Coding System). And theory of Emotion, moving your facial muscles not only Expresses emotions, but also the may even help produce them. May happen because they unconsciously imitata another person of the facial expressions. And whoever thought of that making faces could reveal so much abouf the scepience of the emotions. "
83	In difference in the situation students can't understand someone's expression. 
84	Finally, yes the technology is worth a big margin but its worth to have the help we can all get to help us know many. 
85	Here in the United States, we have a problem of obesity 
86	That the author did good job at explan the evidences like he saws, 
87	"""Just as our jet airplanes travel at a higher altitude to fly over many storms, a veicle hovering over venus would avoid the unfriendly ground conditition by staying up and ount of their way"" That it is imported to study Venus even if it dangers. "
88	In paragraph 4 the author tells us even though Venus's surface had conditions five times more extreme than what we see on Earth, long ago it was covered with large oceans, rocky sediment and craters. If Venus's conditions used to be so similar to Earth then could it possibly have supported life? 
89	In paragraph 7 the author goes to tell us that scientists over at NASA have some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating Venus like conditions.  
90	the most important part of this is that we have to be safe. and do things the right way 
91	Dr. Huang stated that his computer can identify a persons feeling just by scaning them. By the way it look the computer can verify a person experssions by the way that they look even thou some poeple in this world can understand expressions but techology is change and now it can nearly tell human emotion. But yet the differences here are that the computer can see emotions or no emotions at all. 
92	Well the step to take in order to see if a person is showing emotions it would muscular action units. For the instruction 1&2 will determin that techology can tell which from which like a smile canbe tested by a computer or a real person. A machine can tell the difference. 
93	We need to look at the prons and cons cause a person can tell if a person is showing any emotion is how they are useing their mouth's muscular actions such as smiling or frowning. Telling a force one a real smile can be que trickey but a computer can tell the differences. 
94	Trust us there might be a lot of people who need it.  
95	The Alantic Ocean, Pacific Ocean, and others! You might get seasick, but we have some ginger for you that might help.  
96	In the begin in the story it talks about how she had 83 percent happy and 9 percent digusted smile and 6 percent fearful and 2 percent angry. And that her science teacher had graded her latest lab assignment. And that mona lisa at least according some new computer of showing her emotions. 
97	In the body paragraph it talks about how that you have to show your emotions. And the neutral face showing no of there emotions. I wonder why the neutral face does want to show emotions. It will be good if they show emotions. But I think that the neutral face does want to show emotions. Becuase some people might look at them.  
98	In the conclusion part it talks about how you are suppose to smile. And putting on happy face works. If you make a happy face you are showing your emotions to other people. I think that a lot people should put on there happy face. Becuase they will be showing there emotions to people. I think that some people don't want to smile becuase they don't like to smile. Or they hate to smile in front of people. I wonder why some people don't want to smile. I think that some people don't want to smile in front people. Becuasue they are afraid to smile in front of people. 
99	Would you like to be forced to choose an extracurricular activity that you don't like? 
100	I think Luke's point of view of convincing people to go on a Seagoing Cowboy trip. 
101	"The text states  Luke joined the program is it was a once in a lifetime opporortunity. The text states,Luke said why would I pass this up this is anopporortunity of a lifetime. The text alo states, he said being a Seagoing Cowboy was much more than an adventure for him it opened up the world to him. Another thing Luke said is. ""It makes people moreof the other countries in need.  The text states,the cattle boat trip is an unbeliveable opportnity for a small town boy. The text also states,Luke said that awareness stayed with him leading his familly to host a numberofinternational students and exchange visitors for many years. The text also states,Luke found time to have fun on board, especially on the return trips after the animals had been unloaded. Another thing Luke said is he was so grateful for the opportunity.  The text states,Luke got to see all these different countries like china,and Europe. The text also states that Luke got to tour an excavated castle in Crete. Another thing that Luke said is sometimes you won't no when it will happen       "
102	First off, we perform these calcutions everyday, as we can tell if our friend is happy or sad by looking at their face most of the time. Also, video imagery tells us that the facial emotions for each emotion are universal. 
103	Another big reason is that we really don't know just how much computers can do, it can be where computers detect whether you're happy or sad. 
104	"In the ""German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"", there is a new district that has forbidden street parking, driveways, garages. The residents of this upscale community are suburbans poineers.  In france, there is one street that has a tram that runs to downtown. The tram is only thing that drives on the road. there are 2 places to park, one is you park at a large garage at the end of the development , two isÂ  to buy a space for 40,000 dallors and also a home. 70% of vauban do not own cars and 57% sold there cars. I say they should all have cars and drive on then roads because its easier to get around and faster. they should make deals with everyone because so everyone has a chance to drive. "
105	In school can be used for give a lesson,because it will give examples of muscles on your face, 
106	for example on of them can be orbiculris. It can teach the kids that good to show they emotions and how they show them and how they muscles act when they do them. Fothermore it can show the students that they muscles not only express emotions they can make them to. 
107	This experiment it can be help in differents part of the country no only in schools, it can help for example in hospitals 
108	to see how the people that can't move they face or have a muscles problems can tell how they feeling 
109	A idea for the NASA from me to send people to study the planet, is implement a new jetplane more security for thr austronomers for they can survival and can study the planet. And a new uniform most special for the can have the capacity to survival that dangers problems at Venus. 
110	With that work we can explain and understand better about the problems with that planet and have ideas to a better study. 
111	By the author of this topic is really persauding by true facts where it makes u think. 
112	During all this time all the best and expert sciencetist are working together to test a method nd see if we can live on that planet without dying or not producing food or water or even shelter. 
113	While testing we figured out that Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system, even though Mercury is closer to our sun. Beyond high pressure and heat, Venusian geology and weather present additional impediments like erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning strikes to probes seeking to land on its surface. 
114	So that is why I think during the proccess on living venus or in the future testing methods if we could live pn venus or see if we can grow crops or bring like equiment to test samples on we can evole on this planet near us. 
115	Even the thought of going to a new planet is a big turn of events because we dont know how its atmosphere works or gravity or air/oxygen or weather climate change or anything but we are learning about it really fast where we have to make a high expert group of people to risk their lives to see if we can produce our species or our tech,food,citys, or even animal life 
116	in conculsion to make sure that we sure we dont make the smallest mistake to screw up the plans for us to live or visit venus in future but in mean time we have people training to become the best of the best for this secret peoject if it happens. So that is all i gotta say and i hope it does happen to make history on the board for people to live on a new generation. So our main goal is all about Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors. Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation. Even NASA is working on other approaches to studying Venus. For example, some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of VenusÂs surface and have lasted for three weeks in such conditions. Another project is looking back to an old technology called mechanical computers 
117	which has great gass mileage and keeps the enviorment clean. Now some people are atill going to drive there big gas sputering cars around but only a few percent of people change how long you drive or what you drive it can really make a differnce on the world to day you could possiable be saving the next generation  So to all those who agree with me buy a green car or stick with your but drive less often there are other ways to get around without use of a car or motercycle there are bicycles roller scates scooters just to name a few and they also help you get in shape. 
118	First of all, I feel like it's pretty reliable, 
119	"BUT one of the parts that threw me off was when Professer Nicu Sebe said that shes ""83% happy, 9% disgusted, 6% fearful, and 2% angry."" "
120	"Professer Nibu said the process begins when the computer construts a 3-D computer model of the face; all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles. Movement of one or more muscles is called an ""action unit. Then his friend Dr. Huang relies on the work of psychologists such as Dr. Paul Eckman, the creator of FAC (Facial Action Coding). Dr Huang then observed that ""The facial expressions for each emotion are universal, even though individuals often show varying degrees of expression."" "
121	By using video imagery, the new emotion recognition software tracks the facial movements in either or real face or painted picture of Mona Lisa. By weighting the different units, the software can even identify mixed emotions, each expression is compared against a neutral face. In fact, Dr. Huang said that we humans perform the same impressive calculation everyday, like for instance, me going to one of my close friends and seeing them frowning I will assume that they're upset about something. 
122	According to the machine if you frown at it, the next ad will be different. 
123	And lastly, no, the expirement didn't really make me happy, I tried smiling and it felt awkward. 
124	which was very shocking to me because I never knew anything could work like that. Reading this article made me feel smarter in a way, learning something I've never heard or seen before 
125	But in conclusion I feel as if this article is helpful and should be seen to my peers. 
126	They caluclate Mona Lisa emotional they said that she has 83 percent of happyness, 9 percent of disgusted, 6 percent of fearful and 2 percent angry. The computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face; all 44 major muscels in the model must move like human muscles then Dr. Hung relies on the work of psychologists such as Dr. Paul Eckman creator of FACS ( facial action coding system).  For example your frontails parslterails muscle ( above your eye) raises your eyebrows when you're suprised; your orbicularis oris ( around your mouth) tightens your lips to show anger. In a classroom computer could recognize when student is becoming confused or bored at the same time technology can make computer-animated faces more expressive for video games or video surgery.  When feeling down look in the mirror and do these falling steps 1. rasie your lips at the corners of your mouth. 2. then squit your eyes slightly to prduce wrinkling ( crow's feet) at the corners of your eyes. 3. holding that rasie the outer parts of your cheeks up toward your eyes that you smiling as a reowned drama coach constantin stanislvsky had his actors carefully reproduce smiling and frowning as a way of creating these emtions on stage and watching your loves one die will make you cry its the same way watching a movie of someone dieing. 
127	The facial action coding system is not totaly offical. 
128	In the story it says that it uses you face to tell what going on or something. They say that they can tell if it is a real smile or a fake one by your muscules. The muscles called orbicularis make croe's feet around your eyes, but then a fake smile, the mouth is streched sidesways using the zygomatic major and a different muscle called the risorius. Then is said that if an ad pops up and you are happy then the facial action coding system is going to think you like it then more and more are going to be poping up. Sense it said that it can tell eveything just by four face. The rusults won't be right. For people that wear makeup the facial action coding system is not going to get the right results. You might have a facial problem or something wrong with you muscles. That you wouldn'd be able to simle perfectly. Then it will give you wrong results 
129	I do not belive it is true. I will believe it when I see it. 
130	"Luke wanted to be a Seagoing Cowboy. A cattle boat came up and gave him the opportunity to be in the Seagoing Cowboy program. Luke's friend inited him to go on the cattle boat because his friend knew he wanted to be on one. Luke's life changed right after graduation.  Luke did not know his life would change soon. It was 1945, World War ll was over in Europe, and many counties were left in the ruins. UNRRA hired "" Seagoing Cowboys"" to take care of the horses, young cows, and mules that wereshipped over seas. It says that Luke and Don signed up.  He crossed the Antlantic Ocean 16 times and the Pacific Ocean twice to help people affected by World War ll. Luke also found time on board, especially on return trips after the animals had been unloaded.  Luke said "" It made more aware of people of other countries and their needs."" Then awareness stayed with him. The cowboys played beseball and volleyball games on board when Luke was on. There was plenty of games they played on board.  Helping at his aunt Katie's farm as a boy had prepared him is what the paragrph said so what it is saying is when he was little then he went to his aunt Katie's farm and played around and it helped him with his future with animals.        "
131	You could do a 3-D model of the face and put in all of the muscles just like a human has on their face.  You could understand if their happy, suprised, or even sad. Your frontalis pars lateralis muscles ( above the eyes ) raises your eyebrows when your suprised or scared.  Your emotions could be all over the place.  You could have certian facial expressions.  For an example, you could have your fear look. You could've saw something that you're afraid of and have a fear look. The software could even identify mixed emotions. Each expression is compared against a neutral face.  I know that everyone has different facial features, but some people have the same facial expressions.  I personally think that we should all have different facial features because no one can be the same and no one is perfect. 
132	This technology could observe how our face is formed in the future.  
133	"This new technologyis the same technology for making computer-animated faces more expressive for video games or surgery. "" Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication "" that Dr. Huang had. Computured need to understand that, too "" said Dr. Huang.  Your personal computer can't handle the complex of the algorithms used to decode Mona Lisa's smile. "
134	"You sometimes has to ask yourself  "" Does your expression in the mirror suggest an emotion?"" and "" Can your lab partner recognize which one? "" So I think that this technology is a good idea.        "
135	"Venus is the sister planet to Earth but the surface of Venus presents a challange to any living thing. Venus is also called the ""Evening Star"" despite it being a planet.  Venus is a planet that the most like Earth but we bearly studied it because we'll have to get on the planet to do so. Venus has around the same density and size as the Earth but Venus' surface is 800 degrees fahrenheit. Venus' Atmosphere is dangrous as well with 97% of it being carbon dioxide and the clouds made out of highly corrosive sulfuric acid. Many people may be wondering "" If our sister planet is so in hospitable, why are scientists even thinking about any further visits? Astronomers are really fascinated by our sister planet because how close to Earth it really is, Venus even has valleys, mountains, and craters just like our Earth.  For future visits NASA has came up with an idea to has hover crafth that floats 30 or so miles so we wouldn't have to step on the boiling planet. "
136	Venus is a worthy pursuit because the more we know about our sister planet the more things we get to do with it. 
137	because thats like saying our land forms were made by aliens and thats why we have mountains, valleys, and plains. 
138	"In paragraph 6 it says ""although few scientists belived the face was an alien artifact photographing Cydonia bacame a priority fo NASA whe Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) arrived at the Red Planet in Sept1997, eighteen long years after the Viking missions ended."" "
139	A big example is The subject of Leonardo da Vinci's, Mona lisa. Da vinci studied anatomy to thelp them paint facial muscles for paint special emotions 
140	"This subject is really intented to bring a smile to your face, while it shows just how this can computer can do. Your PC can't handle the use to decode Mona lisa smile. But this invent can write down simple instructions that ""encode"" differet emotions. For example, if you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen a similar ad might follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be different. "
141	It can indicate the difference between a genuinie smile and a forced one. To finish with some cientifics conclusions and understand better your boddy. According to the Facial  Feedback Theory of Emotion, moving your facial muscles not ont only express emotions, but also may help produce them. A example is when a drama coach tells to his actor carefully reproduce smiling and frowning as a way of creating these emotions on stage because empath might happen when you see someone else expressions. 
142	"May 19,1950 9:30 A.M.  ""Wow, I Just had a dreamed about when I started to become a seagoing cowboy, man those were the doy days."" ""Well time for breakfast"" I said. Then Like went downstairs and ate some bread. Then I went outside and went to the store and buy some food. Then he went to his family's house to talk to some of the visitors.  May 20, 1950 11:00 A.M.  the next day I got up and did the some the same thing as yesterday but today was a bit different because today My friend Don was trying to find me. Don was able to find me at the ice shop and said that we need to go the Seagoing cowboys program today to teach any of the people who has signed up.  1:34 P.M.  When got there, the place when they held the program was different becaue no one was there. Then we was a sign that said"" ANY EXPERIENCED SEAGOING BOYBOYS COME IN."" ""Ok then"" said Don. Then we When inside there were some old Seagoing Cowboy I remenber.  1:40 P.M. 1950  Then an old man got up and said, "" Thank you you all for coming, I am her to tell you than we need your help."" ""What kind of help?"" asked some Seagoing Cowboy. Well we need you all to go on a little trip back to Europe to help some People out over there becuase some the Students over there needs some adive about some of the jobs you did back in 1945. ""Ok, sure thing"" said most of the Seagoing cowboys. but some of the rest asked 'what, why??"" Well the ship leaves the next day so pack some of your things you well need.  May 21, 1950 Noon  Don and I got on the Ship and into a bunk room. ""Well just like old times"" said Don  ""yup"" I said back. ""Well I am going to explore the ship do you come?"" I asked. ""How about we unpack out things."" Don said ""Ok"" I said.  June 2, 1950 9:00  ""there is a thunder storm out side I wonder if lighing is going to hit the ship?"" I asked. The odds of that .. BOOOM!!! Then the alarm came one and said everyone to get to the life boats. Don and I tried to pack our thing but we only pack hlaf of our things and that fell over board while we got in to the life boats.  June ? 1950 ?:??  Don and I woke up one the beach of a nearby city with a few Seagoing Cowboys. ""Where are we??"" asked Don ""I don't know"" I said.      "
143	because In the text it states that venus is actually a planet and venus is the second planet from the sun. The text also states that venus is simple to see from a far distant. Finally, it says that numerous factors contribute to venus's reputation as a challenging planet for humans to study in etc. If you look back in paragraph 1& 2 that's where I got all the information from to support my answer. 
144	In conclusion studying venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents because if you just reread everything in this passage it's basically telling you alot of information about venus. If you look back in the passage in read paragraph 8 it's giving you information about venus it says that venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors. The last in final thing is that our travels on earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation. So that basically tells you everything about why studying is a worthy pursuit despite for venus. 
145	intro: Today ill be telling you the pros and cons about having this technology in our schools from counslers being able to tell whats with the student to invading the privacy of what we humans have to preventng suicide and to be able to maybe stop someone from commiting suicide or knowing someone is going through depression. 
146	espically for consoulers so say someone is really sad and depressed but they are to scared to open up about how they feel or whats going so you put the computer on there face and it shows they are depressed sad and scared well now you know how your student is feeling 
147	so then you cheer them up and work to make things better you dont know it but you just saved a life because who knows weather or not that student was about to comit suicide or say someone was threatned and they will not tell you that so they act like there fine but you put the computer on them and it shows that they are scared now you know they are scared and can try to work with them to open up 
148	conclusion: inconclusion i think it would be some great technology to have in our schools just think about how many lives we can change or how many lives we can save by just knowing how the person next to you is feeling it would save a lot of time trying to get the person to tell you whats wrong when you can just take a picture of there face so yes i do think it would be great because itll make life better, you would save more time, and you could change alot of lives and save alot of lives with this type of technology. 
149	because if more people sign up for the yearbooks the pictures can be done faster. 
150	the advantages of limiting car usage are very rare 
151	some people own cars some dont some take bus but some work so they can own there own car. there has been a large drop in the percentage 16-to 39 year olds getting there license and other people who already have there license are renewing them, kids get jobs so that when there more older there able to get there own car without asking there parents to take them places . 
152	car ownership is allowed but there are only two places to park large garages at the edge of the development where a car owner buys a spance for the amount of 40,000 with the home 
153	passenger cars are respinsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in europe and up to 50 percent in some car intensive ares in the united states in the new approach stores are placed a walk way on a main street rather than in malls along some distant high way. almost 4,000 drivers wee fined. 53.3 percent average of diesel engines in the rest of western europe 
154	The fact that there is a possiblity of there once being life on that planets surface, that is amazing. 
155	the planet venis is rearly near our earth. it is in the orbit in our solar system so yes it is close by to the earth. Just about anything in the salor system of our is close to us. 
156	"After Luke Bomberger graduation, he had two jobs he worked ar a grocery store and a bank. so when his friend ask him to go to europe on a cattle boat. in the passage luke said that he could not say no. It also includes that it was an opportuity of a lifetime.  In the passage i said that unrra hired ""Seagoing Cowboys'' to take care of horeses, young cows, and mules that were shiped overseas. and Luke and Don sighned up. I think luke sighned up because he was helping out on his aunt farm. So he knew alot about helping with animals. "
157	Taking care of the animals was a great way for me to pass the time and helping my aunt Katie's farm made it alot easier. We arrived in Europe right after the pacific war. After Europe we packed our animals and headed up to Greece. I turned 18 before reaching greece so i was old enough to get drafted into the millitary, But they told me that i should just keep doing what im doing. The sea cowboys program is a great way to do millitary service to. . 
158	''I always say life is not always about what you feel the world consist of others or dose Albert Eistine say that I can not reamember anymore'' ''I know life is not seved to you on a silver plater you have to work for it BUUUT for a hourse it is toutilyey not fair I mean why do they get it all and we have to give it to them. SOOOO sorry I got of tipice waaaaaayyyyyy off topic.'' 
159	What the author was suggesting when he was saying venus is dangerous but a worthy pursuit. 
160	Was that no spacecraft survived more that a couple of hours on venus. 
161	The atmosphere was dangerous to people. 
162	It has the hottest surface temperature. 
163	you cant go onto Venus 
164	Some say that the scientists used a digital three image camera. 
165	"People made a huge deal out of it.  The ""Face on Mars"" appeared in books, magazines, and radio talk shows.  Some people even say it appeared in haunted grocery store checkouts.  "
166	but there is always both sides to a situation like this. 
167	I'm a scientist and there are some explanation to why this face exsict on both sides 
168	and there is many wierd things on this planet with weird shapes, it cant always be martians or aliens. 
169	So to start this off it could be a alien but there is a strong possibility that its not either. 
170	First the face is way to larg to be an actual face, it say it the artical the it is measured in meters, thats almost impossible 
171	It is a real debate on whether the face is real or not. There is also strong evidence on both sides, but NASA has alot of proof that it isn't an alien, they could be hiding it or they can be wrong.        
172	Limiting car usage is a discrase 
173	Why stop making cars when thats what we need the most in this world, with out a car we cant go no where. What they should do is cut down the price to a lower price cause not everyone in this world is a multi millioner. For example on paragraph 12 it says almost 4,000 drivers were fine,according to Reuters ... Twenty seven people had their cars imounded for their reactions to the fine, thats just crazy how they take cars away from people just because of their actions against the fine.  Thats easier to imagine than a car-free Champs Elysees. Congestion was down 60% in the capital of France, after five-days of intensifying smog. Diesel fuel was blamed, sinced Franced has. . . a tax policy that favors diesel over gasoline. Diesels make up to 67% of vehicles in france, compared to a 53.3% average of diesel engnes in the rest of Western Europe, according to Reuters.  Paris typically has more smog than other European capitals... Last week Paris had 147 micrograms of particulate matter (PM) per cubic meter compared with 114 in Brussels and 79.7 in London,Â Reuters found.  The smog cleared enough Monday for the ruling French party to rescind the ban for odd-numbered plates on Tuesday.  In a program thats set to spraed to other countries millions of Colombians hiked,biked skated or took buses to work during a car-free day yesterday, leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffics.  It was the third year cars have been banned with only buses and taxis permmitted for the Day with out cars in the capital city of 7 million. The goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. Vialators faced $25 fines.  
174	And some even have lasted longer then they expected.  
175	Venus is a plant that everyone have Challeng. But some ever close to getting there. The author haved suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers for humans,the risk and approaching it's presents. Never stopping them from doing so. 
176	You can plat baseball and volleyball games in the emty holds where the animals were. You also can play table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, and whittling. The games helped pass the time when you're on the ship. 
177	You could help the countries recover their food supply, animals, and more. It could be fun caring for an animal like it was your own pet. 
178	Venus is the second planet. Sometime, NASA called venus the Evening Star, because it's one of the brightest light in the night sky 
179	Venus is closest to earth, and earth has a twin. The differences between mars and venus is that sometimes we are esloser to mars and sometimes we are colser to venus, because venus is sometimes around the corner in space and human are sent to numerous spacecraft. No spacesraft has survived more than a few hours not a single spaceship has touched down on venus's more than three decades. When the spacesship trys to land it can't because venus is almost 97 percent caron dioxide blankets venus and the most challenging is that venus have clouds that are highly corrosive sulfuric acid in venuss atmosphere. Venus temperatures average is over 800 degrees fahenheit. Not many people has land on venus because how hot the planet is and if they are up thirty plus miles above the surface it's still going to be toasty at around 170 degrees. The most importsntly, researchers cannot take samples of rock gas, or anything elae from a distance. The scientists to see the conduct to thorough mission is to understand venus they need to get close and personal despite the risks. A old technology called mechanical computers the devices were first envisioned in the 1800s and it played an important role in 1940s during the world war 2. It's danger to be on venus it's so hot we won't survived by trying to land on it it's 800 degrees on the planet. Venus might be the second to the sun but mercury is closer to our sun and venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system, but merury is closer to the sun. The high pressure and heat vennusian geology and weather presen is like erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes and the frequent lighting strikes to probes of seeking to the land on its surface. NACA try to challenge them self they been trying to find a way to land on venus and makes sure that the spaceship can land on venus. NASA are still working on a spaceship to land more than a few hours so they can see more things about venus that we don't know about. 
180	"In 2006 the united states and other areas started to try these things and they called it ""smart planning"". car ownership is allowed but there are only two parking areas-large garages at the edge of the development where a car-owner buys a space for $40,000, along with a home. vauban, home to 5,500 residents within a rectangular square mile, is the most advanced experiment in low car suburban life. ""All of our development since World War II has been centered on the car, and that will have to change,"" said david goldberg.    "
181	"Evening star""is what they call Venus. The nickname gaive the rung idea of Venus. Peolpe where misstaking that Venus is a star. Venus it's a own plant. In the text says ""Venus is the second plant from our sun."" In phragraph one. Reserchers study Venus becouse backthen is was closer to earth. Dispise of Venus bing dangers. Reserchers what to fide out if it still hase some earth fechers. "
182	NASA whats to get information about Venus. 
183	"One of the idea of NASA is to seand peolpe to Venus. People will hover throw space. In the text says""our jet airplanes travel at higher altitude to fly over may storms.""In phragraph five. Flying aroud Venus is not placent. Dispice that Venuse is very hot,bing above is about 170 degrees Fahrenheit. The air pressure is lower like the sea leveal. Resiving infromation in venus is limited becouse of how much lights it gives. We can not take anying from mars frome a distance. NASA have not founed a way to get far in to Venus. With this problem NASA takes it risky or as a challeng.  "
184	Anuther way to resive infromation is by sending elatronics to Venus. 
185	"NASA had sent mutuple objets to mars. The objet semes to only servive fore some few three weeks. In oder to make somthing beter to sent in Venus is lookng at obld technology. Looking at phragraph siven it tells us that ""Another project is looking back to an old technology called mechanical computers."". NASA uesd newer technology but it has not over three weeks. Sending mechens that are made with meatel it will mealt or over heat because of the heat in Venus. With the old mechens and with the newer we will fined a more resestent salustion that can healp us with information. "
186	One day we will have the limets to go in Venus. NASA has not gavie up Venus. Venus is valuble to us not olny because it's just a nuther resuers but because it will let us have the lemits to explore other plants. I do balive that we should know other plants. We shouled tot be limited with awer inmagination. 
187	"The software is the latest innovation fro professer. Thomas Huang,of the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science at the Universiy of illinos,working in collaboation with Professer Nicu. Sebe of the University. Dr. Huang and his colleague are experts at developing better way for human and coumputers to communicate.  The process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face;all 44 major muscles in the the model must move like humans muscels. Movement of one or more muscles is called an ""action unit."" Then Dr. Huang relies on the work of pyschologists such as Dr. Paul Eckman,creator of FACS.  They want to use this technology to help in a classroom to see when a kid is confused or boerd to help them to plan lesson that the kids will learn from. Eckman has claaified six basic emotions happiness,surprise,anger,disgust,fear,and sadness and then associated each with characteristic movements of facial muscles "
188	because I think I will become dectration to kids because they will want to play with it to see her they feel. This type of technology should be use for treapist to help read patient when they are talk about their life so the treapist know how they felt about that part in there life. 
189	"It will help the video game industry with the evidence from paragraph 6 ""The same technology can make computer-animated faces more expressive-for video games or video surgery."" "
190	i gess its a good idea but on the other hand nah i mean lookif pepal want to ruin the world with gas thats there choce man 
191	"Three out of four children and teens spend more than seven hours on their phone or watching television. These devises put out blue light into the the eye which is bad because, this can cause straining in the eye or even total blindness. when you are on your phone most of the time you have acess to the internet which means you can get on social media websites. When on websites like snapchat and instagram teens tend to compare their selves to others, and if they aren't up to par to look like ""pretty"" people they can get sad and form some type of depression. "
192	"The computer will construct a 3-D model of the face; all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles. Movement of one or more muscles is called an ""action unit."" Dr. Paul Eckman has classified six basic emotions- happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness- and then associated each with characteristic movements of the facial muscles. All of humans show the same facial expressions but maybe some at different times. The Mona Lisa demonstration is intened to bring a smile to our face, while it shows just how much this computer can do. "
193	muscles in the face just act naturally 
194	the encoding is complex 
195	The Scientests have a whole process. 
196	Having good guidelines and being told what the expectations are will give students a better chance at success. 
197	discovering more about their interests 
198	socializing with their peers. 
199	Many years ago scientist believed that Venus use to have Oceans and Valleys.  
200	This subject today is still a pop icon. It has starred in a Hollywood film , appeared in books and magazines , radio talk shows and it even haunted grocery stores checkout lines for 25 years.  
201	After that , everyone was not satisfied. The face on mars is located at 41 degrees north and was winter in april 1998 - a cloudy time of year. The camera had to peer through wispy clouds to see the face. 
202	"In the article ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" the author gives us reasons why exploring Venus would be very difficult. But, at the same time, the author gives us reasons why it's important to explore Venus. It's because Venus is Earth like, and so we might be able to visit it one day. "
203	This means that even though it's dangerouse to go to Venus, we shouldn't help us hold it back, space is a very dangerous place, and if we let us hold us back, we won't get anywhere, and Fast. 
204	"Did you know that there are car-free cities? In the German suburbs, life goes on without cars and vehicles to use as transportataion. In the outskirts of Freiburg, a lot of things that envolve car use are forbidden. Driving in Paris is also banned because of smog. In Bogoto, Columbia, they decided to spead the Day Without Cars to local countries.  Near the French and Swiss borders, on the outskirts of Freiburg, street parking, driveways, and home garages are forbidden in the new district. On Vauban's streets, it is almost a car-free area. The only vehicle on the streets is the tram that travels to downtown Freiburg and few streets on one edge on the community. It's not like the whole idea of cars are forbidden. People are allowed to own cars but, there are only two places to park. ""They are allowed to park in large garages at the end of the development, where a car-owner buys a space, for $40,000, along with a home"", paragraph 2 states. "
205	After reading this article, I am not fascinated by Venus and what the future intails for us humans.   
206	Everyone has a hobby or something they enjoy doing at home why not just do it at school with your friends. 
207	According to the article people are able to tell if you are having a bad day. 
208	First off, Mona Lisa is mostly always happy and she wanted to come up with a way to see if a lot of school students are happy or just faking there happiniss and hiding there real emotions. 
209	there is this three D computer that can take calculations on your emotions and tell you if you are truly happy or hiding your real emotions.  
210	i think you shoukd try this if you ever get a chance. 
211	First, how does this new technology work 
212	First, how would the new technology detect the emotions? The Facial Action Coding System is how 
213	Aliens aren't realistic 
214	"As we come to unmask the face on Mars the gravitational pull has formed the ""face"" on Mars by waste build up. Aliens are fictional creatures that live in movies and tv shows, not in the real world. "
215	They even indicate the difference between a genuine smlie and a forced one. In the real smile, the zygomatic major (muscles taht begin at your cheek bones) lift the corner of your mouth. (That's our instruction #1.) Muscles are called orbicularis oculi pars palpabraeus make crow's-feet around your eyes.(That's instruction #2.) 
216	The Author supports this idea because he or she says Venus is too dangerous for astronuts to go to and study. 
217	the Robot can study the plant while the astromistes stay on earth and they can egt data about venus thanks to the Robot. The Author says that NASA is always inventing new ways to get information from space and plants without doing it in person. 
218	I fell like the author is correct about these staements because Space and the other plants are not safe for humans to even step foot on. 
219	When the Author says that technolgy will be your best friends for ching out space and the other plants and get information for you the auther is correct.  
220	Sometimes something happens like sometime their computer act up or they need to be replaced so sometimes they are not reciving information from the robots and it makes it very diffcault to see what is happing in Space, and what is happing on the Plants. So sometimes the astronuts would have to go into space and retreve the robots themselfs and bring them back to earth so they can fix them if the robot is broken 
221	also a lot of schools do a horrible almost a illegal jobs and reading kids emotions and helping there students 
222	Citizens cars are good to have but all the fines and stress they are putting on us makes us not wont to buy a car. 
223	they are talking about fining and impounding our cars the ones (Cars) we paid full cash for. 
224	We should learn more not only on the outter shell, but more deeply in the inside. 
225	Venus is the second planet in the our solar system(Milkyway). Also ot is one of the brightest points in the sky at night. As the closest plant to Earth in terms of size, density, and distane. The surface of it is full with valleys, mountains, and craters. Not even one single spacecraft have reached to it before. 97 percent of the atmosphere is carbon dioxide, forming a blanket for the planet. This planet has the highest temperature in the whole entire Milkyway. NASA(National Aeronautics and Space Administration) have not stop sending spacecraft to land on Venus.  
226	If we could lend on Venus later on in the generation, could there be any living organisum that lives on that plante? There could be a possible chance since Earth is not the only planet in space. There are more things tha we need to discover. 
227	You would never know if there are creatures like ous that have a abiliy to explore space. We should keep trying even if there is only a 0.0000001 chance. 
228	There are many advantages of limiting car usage 
229	"In Vauban, Germany, residents of this upscale comunnity are surburban pioneers, going where few soccer moms or commuting executives have ever gone before: they have given up their cars. ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,"" said Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two, as she walked verdant streets where the swish of bicycles and the chatter of wandering children drown out the occasional distant motor "
230	Basic precepts are being adopted around the world in attempts to make suburbs more compact and more accessible to public transportation, with less space for parking. In this new approach, stores are being placed a walk away, on a main street, rather than in malls along some distant highway. 
231	"After days of near record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city. Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five-days of intensifying smog. The smog rivaled Bejing, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world.  In Bogota, Columbua, there is a program that's set to spread to other countries, millions of Columbians hikes, biked, skated or took buses to work during a car-free day, leaving the streets of this capital city eerily deviod of traffic jams. ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,"" said businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza as he rode a two-seat bicycle with his wife. "
232	in greece which i thought was reallt speacial was seeing the Acropolis. I also went to venice Italy, a city with streets of water 
233	I hope you choose to become a seagoing cowboy and help out the people in need.             
234	I feel like it should and here's why. 
235	"My evidence why I wrote that satatment is the passage it said ""she's 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted,6 percent fearful,and 2 percent angry"" I think everyone should have this because it could save a lot of people lives because so many people take their lives away so fast and young because of depresion and lot are teens if high schools and jr high haves these i feel like it would change the world for the better "
236	The vehicle can be totaled which means that the vehicle can no longer be driven 
237	I think technology reading people emotional expressions is valuable but then again i don't think is is valuable 
238	being able to know how people feel can actually help the enviornment but then it can't 
239	peoples reactions emotional expressions are different and people are different some people can have bad emotional expressions and it could be harmful, and it could be painful for others. People can have really great emotional expressions, like being happy all the time. It says in paragraph 1 that Mona Lisa is 83 percent happy, 9 percent discusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry. People can be the complete oppisate of that and it couldn't be good on other people, But people can also be like Mono Lisa and it makes the inviornment a better place knowing people are happy and not sad, discusted and angry. 
240	"Many countries all over the world are starting making either a ""car free day"" or on certain days, making people pay fines for driving.  "
241	So next time your about to get in your car think about if you really need to take your car.  
242	"In the first story it is talking about how cars aren't really drivin near the French and Swiss. Though theyallow the cars they just allow them to be parked in only two places: the car-owner buys a space or it to, $40,000 along with the home, or large garages at the edge of the development.  David Goldberg said "" All of our development since World War ll has been centered on the car, and that will have to change.""  Paris, France has enforeced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the gobal city. Diesel fuel was blamed, since diesels make up 67 percent of vehicles in France, compared to a 53.3 percent average of diesel engines in the Western Europe.  In Bogota, Colombia they ban cars altogether. they go rid of the roads and made them into sidwalks. Now that people have to walk to get to their final destination a lot of people now go to the parks and to the sports centers that they have there.  President Obama's goals are to curb the United States ' greenhouse gas emissions will get a fortuitous assit from the incipient shift in American behavior. Obama said that if we Americans buy less cars then there would be less drivers lisenes each year and fewer driving altoether.    "
243	You can identify which studnet needs help and can go and talk to that student . 
244	Im both with and against this . 
245	Some schools are requiring students to do a summer projects to assure that they are learning during their break. Do you think that this project should be designed by the teachers or students? 
246	The mona lisa demonstration is one of the paintings that showes how someone felt 
247	Accordig to the facial feedback ''theory of emotion movig your facial muscles not only expresses emotions but also may even help produce them''. 
248	Dr. Huang even knew individuals showed degrees of exprssions 
249	he used video imagaery to track the new facal movements on a real face. this software tracks all the facial movments and mixed emotions every face they get is compared to a neutral face.  Dr. Huang is a colleage expert at developing better ways for humans and computers to communicate. 
250	My evidence i got out the article is imagine being able to detect exactly how other person feeling i got that out the article to help me withmy answer. Thats how i found out my answer cause i got it out the article.  The main point of me saying my opion is because how the lady looking in this picture it look like she dont look to happy or less she just making up fake smile to hide her pain.  In article two it says could you calculate your emotions like math my opion of that is no but in the way it seems like people could calculate your emotions like math. 
251	The way the Author was telling us throughout the story was fasanating 
252	he let you know everything the hwole way. he studied about the pmanet Venus to let us all know about it and understand it better so we arent as worried to think aliens are on that planet but if they knew that no life forms live on that planet and people get a relief. They steady study about the the way Venus is what if thier is a living form okn the planet but just is hiding like no one would ever know but they are still trying to find things out and thier are things we do know about but are going to find out alot more about. They are trying to improve thier computers the way they do thinhgs just to get to where they need to be to be able to research what they want to research but we just have to eaiot and see wjat other things we have to go through and face with the earth we have right now is getting worse and worse people try and justify others when in order to judge someone you have to of went what they have went through and its hard but we try and move as a team to get to where we should be going. The better we get technology wise the farther we can look and just do things it would be amazing and just progress and everybodyu would be good. 
253	"Some people don't believe in alien lifeforms on other planets; they would say, other planets can't support life there due to multiple things: no oxygen, water, food, etc. We scientist respond to this with, ""We have all those things here, there has to be some other planet like us."" "
254	Humans need food, water, and air to live, but that doesn't mean that aliens do. They could be like plants and create their own food inside their bodies. As for water, NASA has discovered that there used to be water on the moon, so what is there to believe there couldn't be any water anywhere else.  People can be very religious and about the Bible and God, but other people can be all about evolution and not creation. If humans evolved from animals, then we might not be the only ones. Which means that if humans can evolve into humans, then other organisms can evolve, also. 
255	The Face on Mars might be a butte or mesa, but that doesn't mean other organisms don't live outside of the Solar System. 
256	We can't leave here, so we won't ever be able to know. Life beyond Earth may be just a myth, but it also may be something truly amazing. 
257	"""The process begins when the computer costructs a 3-D computer model of the face,"" to me that just sounds like something may go wrong for the fact we have the same kind of camrea for the Iphone and people have trouble with that. "
258	"Another problem for his idea is, ""That facial expressions for each emotion are universal,"" I really don't know about the meaning of this but it doesn't sound good to me either. "
259	Plus they say that technology is going to take over the world, this just might be another reason for this to may be happen. 
260	There would never be a dull moment in front of the computer though.  
261	Maybe you are just sitting around and you get bored and have nothing better to do so you get up and you make your way to the computer and play with the emotion detector just by making faces at your computer seeing if it can guess how you are feeling.  
262	Technology is advancing quick, it is nothing like it used to be, but either you have to run with it or get ran over. 
263	"Things are changing fast we have to change with them.  This is why this technology is so valuable, we can use it in many ways even if its not important.  We can still get use out of it, so why not make it a thing? In the article it says ""She is 83 percent happy, 9 percent digusted, 6 percent fearful and 2 percent angry"" talking about the Mona Lisa painting.  Now you cant tell me that that is not cool at all. "
264	Does computer even have emotional?  I don't think so but they can't tell people emotinal . 
265	At the end of the artcle, the author finally mentions his viewpoint on the subject.  But during the actual article, it is not once mentioned that we should go to Venus. 
266	Instead of making someone look happy people should talk to the person that is upset, trying to be there for them maybe thats all they need or tell them soemthing postive to brighten there day. 
267	Dr. Huang's invention is very interesting 
268	It's so crazy to think that a computer can tell if your sad or happy 
269	i think this idea is pretty cool 
270	"Dr. Paul Eckman has classified six basic emotions happiness,surprise,anger,disgust ,fear and sadness. they are controlled by facial muscles above your eyes. People can tell when u are fake smiling or making a fake facial exspression. There is a new technology called the facial Action coding system enables computers to identify humans emotions. They also exsplain how people can tell what your emotion is by your facial exspressions. They can tell if you are happy or sad just by looking at you also when u fake smile specialist can tell because it streches your mouth sideways using the zygomatic major and a different muscle. A muscle called orbicularis oculi pars palpabraesus makes crow's feet around your eyes which is also a sign that u have a fake smile. They also explain the steps you can do to show what they are talking about with having ""crows feet"" when you are fake smiling. moving your facial muscles not only exspressses emotion, but also helps produce them and putting on a happy face eventaully works. some actors have to use these emotions and facial expressions when they are on stage. "
271	its crazy how making faces could show so much about emotions. 
272	car culture. 
273	there are advantages to limited car usage because of Car Culture 
274	In the Challenge of the Exploring Venus, the auther suggests that studying venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers I think he I right, but i think that the dangers are to much to risk. 
275	In the story the auther calls venus the ''Evening Star'' and said that it was one of the brightest points in the the sky,but it also said ''while venus is simple to see from a good distance, but safe vantage point from eath.'' 
276	Some of the ways that venus is too dangerus to go to is because we know what will happy if we go. 
277	We sent things up befor and each previous mission was unmanned but for good reason, since not one spacecraft survied the landing for more then maybe a few hours. Thats when we saw the issue and stoped sending up sacescrafts. Not one spaceship has touched down on venus in more that three decades.  A thick atmospehere of 97% carbon dioxide covers venus, also to add to that theres even more difficulit clouds of highly corrosive sulfric acid on venus. On the the planet the conditions arfe far more extreme then anything humans encoouter on earth or anywhere so far. The atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we have on earth. besides high presurs and unbareable heats, the weather is bad too. Erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquackes, and very frequent lighting strikes. 
278	In the end, our travels on earth and farther should'nt be limitted but at the same time we are facesed with dangers and things we sould strive to do better in but we should do our best to look at the word without getting to close to danger. 
279	The painting Vinci did was only one of the thing he did he mad more thing in the pass but the whole world knowes him for this one pating he ,ad and everyone from king to people like me and you come and see it 
280	Leonardo da Vinci will be the best man in the world for making this 
281	at his time the detels he put in to this and the paint he put in to was one of the best thing he could of done. 
282	"The Nasa said that ""These condistions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth, but such and environment would crush even a submarine accustomed to diving to the deepest parts of our Oceans and wuld liquefy many matals"". so they mean that if they go there i die soo easly bc of the heat and the imposible because the planet is 97 persent blacket around of the planet. But they trying to send something on the venus but it died it was one of the oldest michanical they mad e for space planets so they can take a photo.   "
283	""" noumerous facters contrirbute to venus's repuaton as a challenging planet for humans to study on."" "
284	Student's most of the time dont like school so these Activity'sÂ can show them that school can be fun. These activity'sÂ will give kids a chance to see the bright side of school and also the true meaning. It will also teach kids that trying new things out with new people can be fun. These programs can really make a kids or teens life a huge impact. 
285	These Activity's can teach kids so many life lessons. It help kids and teens who think they are lazy turn into great students. These Activity's can inspire students to do better in school and lift there grades up. It can help kids/teens find out what they truly love and what they truly dislike. 
286	I disagree, I feel that the Mona Lisa wasnt really expressing 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry, 
287	she looked like she was just posing for a picture or to be drawn, you cannot just look at somebody and tell what kind of emotions their expiriencing even if you do studies, it could just be thats how she is as a person all the time. The author uses facial feedback theory of emotion, saying not only does moving your facial muscles just express emotions , it may also even help produce them. They say that faces dont lie but anyone can fake emotions she was just taking a photo or was posing to be drawn they could have just made a conclusion stating she was 100 percent happy, I mean she was being drawn which means she must have been one of the best looking women around or something was good about her and only her, and her face drawing is now one of the most known pieces of art ever created. In the drawing it looks like shes outside so it could be the lighting or something around her that is causing her face to look like that. Its also hard to tell what kind of emotions shes having because she doesnt have eyebrows, the reason I say that is because most people raise or lower their eyebrows when they are trying to make their emotions noticable, so the main thing people can see about her emotions are her lips they look happy but its like a half smile, but the writer claims she is 83 percent happy, it seems much less than that. Her eyes look like she is staring at someone, not dissapointed. 
288	"In paragraph 4 he says that ""astronomers are fascinated by venus because it may well once have been the most Earth like planet in our solar sytem."" Thats him explaining why venus is worthy of studing and has earth like features. "
289	In paragraph 5 he beins to talk about NASA and them sending humans to study venus. 
290	"The author says that ""NASA's possible solution to the hostile condition on the surface of venus would allow scientist to float above the fray."" He is now explaining how they can make it suitable for people to go study venus. "
291	"how there's life forms on Earth, typicaily Humans, Animals and even Bacteria like Algy and Fungi, In the article ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" In paragraph 4 it says ""Venus could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth "
292	Another reason why Venus is worth studying is, like the Sun its the hottest thing in our solar system 
293	what if it relates to Earth in many ways? 
294	"In the article in paragraph 4 it says ""Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans"" "
295	 By the way, how are you feeling now that I am stating my opinion? I hope you are feeling great because I know I am. 
296	The one thing it didn't mention in the artical was his family where were they the whole time Luke was on board.  The artical never mentioned a mom or dad.  Was Luke alone with no communication skills. 
297	I think you shouldn't join the Seagoing Cowboys 
298	The Author also simply puts in the article that humans have sent numerous spacecraft to land on Venus all unmanned. 
299	"In another quote by the author and in the article ""Astronomers are fascinated by Venus beceause it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system."" the author gives us a reason and it's a reason that makes logical sense. The landscape of Venus is also described in the article as Earth like. "
300	The author suggested studying Venus would be a wirthy pursuit despite the dangers. 
301	How many people die yearly from texting and driving?

303	I don't drive yet but everyone should just know this rule or just follow it at all times watch for police, 
304	It could not be made by aliens because Mars can make land forms such as a face or something. 
305	 We have snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, reaveling. . .a natrual landform.  As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image three times bigger than the pixel size, so if there were objects in the picture like airplanes on the ground of Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks,you could see what they were.  What the picture actual shows is the Matrian equivalent of a butte or mesa- landforms common around the American West. New high-resolution images and 3D altimentry from NASA's Mars Global Survey spacecraft reveal the Face on Mars for what it really is: A messa. l   
306	Today my firend Don Reist inviited me to come with him to the Seagoing Cowboys program he wanted me to go and tought about and Want to go mainly becaues I was 18 and out of school and i can get dafted to the army.  Don telled me that since the war was over we go to this other country and help them out a little sice it was a big mess over.  It was August 14, they reported us at New Orleans. When we got there they were giving out thing to do before the ship got there they said for me go get more peole to do this program and I did. I walked down to the bordwalk got a big line of people the fun thing was that if you get to convince eveyone who does not want to go then they just go some were real nice and just went but they were probalry going to be dafted like me.  August 15 the cattle boat was not there so, they said do the same thing again the same thing happend got a lot of people then they gave another job that it is to see wich man was strong enough to go they said i got to much people so, we get the strongest of the strongest two hour went bye and when eveyone was at lunch the boat was there .  August 16, I guess sleeping in a boat is the same thing as sleeping in a bed room but the bed was always moving but I can't lie about spleeping good last night. tonigth was a big night for me I was a wachtman . It was 11:00 ol'colck and it was raining and the waves sarted to pick up and then i slipped!  down a slide thank god i'm ok but I had to be in bed for a little with a cracked rib.  I was being dafted but they told me to keep doing my servive so, I did and I had the best three years ever I helped over 1 millon people and I visted nine countrys the good thing is that I'm ok  
307	because it is the closest planet to us but defining the risks it will take they are doing research. but they are trying to make a man pod for a human to go there and study it first hand. 
308	the author did support his story with facts that if we dont do it now then human curiosity will do it later 
309	I came here to try to explain how much I loved this trip. It prepared me for life. I hope you will join and become a Seagoing Cowboy. The phone number is below  (555) 444-7774

312	First,Dr Huang and his colleague are experts at developing better ways for human and computers to comunicate. 
313	Dr. Huang think that it won't make a differences by the new techonlogy. Dr. Eckman has classified six basic emotions-happiness,surprise,anger,digust,fear,and sadness-and then associated each charachteristic movements of the facial muscles..Using video imagery,the new emotion recognition software these facial movements in a real face or Mona lisa. If a computer could identity then it should identy all 44 major muscles in the movement like humans. 
314	"Second,""the facial expressions for each emotion are universal,""observes Dr. Huang.""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confued or bored""Dr. Huang predicts.""Then it could modify the lesson,like an effective human instructo.""""Most human communication is nonverbal,including emotional communicaton,""notes Dr. Huang.""So computers need to understand that,too."" "
315	Then,Your home PC can't hanlde the complex algotithms used to decode Mona Lisa's smile. 
316	"But we can wrtie down some simple instruction that""encode""different emotion. In fact,these are the instructions for a face that looks happy. It;s all about those muscular action units. Humans could tell a friend is feeling simply by he look on her or hise face. Of course,most of us would have trouble actually describing each facial trait that convy happy,worried. "
317	Conclusion,The new techgology won't be valuable to read the expressions of students in a classroom because empathy may happen. 
318	"in Vauban, Germany a residents of this upscale community aew suburban pioneers, where people have given up their cars. Automobiles are the linchpin of suburbs, where middle-class families from chicago to Shanghai tend to make their homes.  The residents are trying to make cities denser, and better for walking for the past two decades, so Vauban, home to 4,400 residents within a rectangularsquare mile, may be the most advanced experiment in low-car suburban life. In United States, the Environmental protection Agency is promoting ""car reduced"" communities, and legislators are starting to act, if cautiously. "
319	Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city. It is either leave your cars at home or suffer with a fine of 22-euro on mondays with even-numbered license plates and the same with the odd-numbered plates the following day. Because Paris typically has more smog than other European, delivery companies complained of lost revenue, while exceptions were made for plug-in cars, hybrids, and cars carrying 3 or more passengers. 
320	A lot of Americans are buying less cars, a study last year found out that driving by young people decresed 23 percent betweeen 2001-2009. Executive chairman of the Ford Motor Company, laid out a business plan for a world in which personal vehicle ownership is impractical.    
321	If you joined this program u could do lots of differents. You would not just do one thing all the time. 
322	Venus is one of three planets that orbit the sun at different times and speeds. Venus has a temperature of 800 degrees ferenheit and the atmospheric pressure is about 90 greater than what we get on Earth. 
323	The only thing you can really do is pray for the best to happen and keep living your life. I feel like every driver should be at least 17+ driving because at the age i feel like a little more common sense it should know by now what the rules are. 
324	There are advantages to this way of life 
325	In America people use automobiles for evryday life. 
326	And what if your in a hurry to get to work how are you going to get there in time if your only going at a walking speed. The crowd would slow you down emensly, even at school the crowd can slow a person down by a lot. when the teacher lets us out early I dont have to fight the crowd as much and can get to my parent much faster to go home. 
327	The prompt says to find good things about not having cars but I just cant because the bad is more bad than the good is good. 
328	It doesn't really try to convince you to participate in the program but if you do you can get some details from what he did to what you might do if you joined. 
329	"The process of the software computer begin when the computer constructus a 3-D computer model of the face. it explain that thhe computer jus move muscle and the way faces move like in paragraph 3 describe "" all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles. Movement of one or more muscles is called an action unit "". this mean that they read the muscle in the face to explain what motion humans do. "
330	For an example a person is working and your boss tells he/she to do something and that person doÂ notÂ do it. There is an big chance of that person getting fired because he/she didÂ not do what they we're suppose to do. which can affect what they do in their life and can impacted the way they handle situation. 
331	Second student will be more interested because students are designing the project other than just a teacher telling them what to do 
332	For an example my friend was looking for an expensive pair of shoes that he put somewhere in his closet. But he can't find them in there because his closet is a complete mess. But if he was organized than he would notÂ had lost them in his closet. This shows if your not organized then theirs a possibilities that you might misplace something thats importuning. 
333	If you even had a chance to explore something different and be part of it, would you? 
334	Sometimes its kinda bad driving because the percentage of transportation is getting too high, also theres a whole bunch of drivers that are starting to find according to reuters so that caused to tthe people cars had their cars impounded for their own reaction due to the fine    
335	because he said the sun is more colse from us and mars is more close from the sun but he said tahat venus is actually a planet and hes telling us a lot about the planets and about the ones are more close from us and about the stars he talking to and the planets surface temperatures average over 800 degrees the earth, venus and mars are neighbor orbit the sun at different speeed. these are dfferent on speed and venus is one of the brighest points of light in the night at the sky venus is a planer in our solar system, but i think the earth and venus are likr twings because iif i thinkg they are th same size and i think the same mass and space and in space terms humans have snet numerous spacecraft to land on this almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets venus even more over 800 degrees fahrenheit and the atmospheri pressure is 90 times greater 
336	The scienties are trying to put humans on the planted venus they say its human temp there so we can live there. They say there are dangers stuff in venus they still have to see ow would they grow food and kill animals and take it down there. I think this is a good idea becuase it would make the earth a lot smaller in population and not so packed acrroding to the artical venus is big. Sometimes where closer to mucrey then venus and sometimes were closer to venus, venus is one of our plantes and someday some people will live on them its cool how we never thought these planets would be used and now people are so smart. That they make rockets to see how it looks and deel like on other planet of cours it nothing on there yet one dsay weveryone should be able to go there and live and see how it is but a lot of people will get sick because of water issues not the same water u been drinking waether is gooan not be the same. 
337	The last thing is what are the teachers going to do with the imfomation on how they think their students are feeling based on a facial expression 
338	If an assignment is student-designed then the student will do one of three things: overwork themselves, not fully apply their capabilities, or not do the work at all. 
339	For these reasons, summer assignments should all be teacher-designed. 
340	Mars hasn't stayed the same over the years. Mars has changed a lot over the years. And Mars (aka. the red plant) will continue to changed until the end of time.  
341	"While we were observing Mars on 1976 with Viking 1 we seen a figure that looked like a human face and that strected 2 miles from end to end. At the Jet Propulsion Lab there had to be a great deal of suprise. Peole started to imidiately think this was created by aliens. That was still to be figured out.  Over the next 25 years scientists studied Mars to determine if this was created by aliens or its just a natural landform. Scientist have been using many different spacecrafts to better understand the ""face"". The picture of mars had become a pop icon. its was in a hollywood film, in magazines and books.  Mission Controllers prepared to look again. ""it's not easy to target Cydonia,"" says Garvin. ""in fact, it's hard work."" Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on A JPL website, revealing a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all.           "
342	"Why? becuase some people want to express themselves of their feelings that has been done by others. But not such that. In fact, we humans perform this same impressive ""calculation"" everday. For instance you can probably tell if a friend is feeling simply emotion by looking at thair face. But for some people painting portraits can help them express their feelings through painting. Sometimes people express their emotions through music by singing or making music. Then in the Mona Lisa, no one knows what feeling she is expressing and what is she feeling. For instance, some artists say she is happy but no one really knows what emotion she is feeling "
343	In conclusion, I think classrooms shouldn't use Facial Action Coding System to identify the expression of students an how they are feeling. But some people have hidden talents that they use to express themselves or their emotions. Also not many people icluding students express themselves through painting some use dancing, acting, making music, singing, cooking and their are many ways of expressing your emotions through many things. For instance people express themselves through writing books, but many people can understand their feelings that by reading their life as a book. 
344	He starts off by talking about how Venus is a very similar planet to ours 
345	I think its ok so you can know how the person is feeling 
346	First,Professor. Thomas Huang of the beckman Institute for advanced Science at the University of Illinois working with  Professor. Nicu Sebe of the University of Amsterdam. Dr. Huang and his colleague are developing better ways for humans and computers to communicate which the proces begin when a computer constructs a 3-D computer Model of the Human face that contains all 44 major muscles in the model that must move like Human. 
347	"Second,The Facial Expressions of some individuals often show varying degrees of expression and the new emotion-recognition software tracks facial movements in a real face or in the painted face if Mona Lisa. Each expression of a Human is being compared against a neutral face (showing no emotion). In fact us Humans perform the same impressive ""calculation"" everyday. "
348	Third,Mona Lisa's Demonstration really intended to bring a smile on your face, For example: if you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen a similar ad will follow but if your frown the next ad will be different,which makes the classroom computer recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored then it could modify the lesson like an effective human instructor and with the same technology it can be used to make computer-animated faces more expressive for video games or video surgery. 
349	Last,Our Muscles called Orbicularis oculi pars palpabraeus make crow's feet around your eyes, in a false smile the mouth is stretched sideways using the zygomatic major and a different muscle, the risorious. But, to an expert faces don't lie; the muscle clues are sometimes used to spot when a smiling politician or celebrity isn't being truthful. 
350	", Mona Lisa has 83% of happiness 9% disgust 6% fearful and 2% ssanger. According to some new computer software that can reconize emotion the sofware is the latest innovation from prof. Thomas Huang, of the beckman institute for advanced science at the unversity of amsterdam. The process begins when the computar constructs a 3-D computar model of the face: All 44 mayjor muscles in the model must move like human muscles movement of one or more muscles in the model is called an ""action unit"" then Dr. Huang relies on the work of psychologist, such as Dr. Paul Eckman, creator of FACS. Eckman has classified six basic emotions happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness and then associated each with characteristics movements of the facial muscle "
351	I think i like the new technology that the person invented it can detect your emotins and feelings. And i doubt others can invent something like that 
352	Venus could be suitable for humans 
353	Venus could have to be humanities future if we keep polluting Earth 
354	Venus could be suitable yet harsh, but still needs to be learned about a lot more. We still know only the bare minimum of Venus. 
355	The advantages of limiting car usage 
356	in conclusion i do not the think the author wants to visit venus because it is way to hot to even try to land there if we did land there you would melt it says in paragraph 3 that the enviorment would crush a Submarine that is accustomed to dive in the deepest parts of our oceans. venus has erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequrnt lighting strikes to any thing trying to land on its surface. 
357	"In the passage they gave an example of a real face painted of ""Mona Lisa"" becuase in the picture she has a stright face and she shows ""no emotion"". But it is also made to put a smile on your face.  The computer model of the face technology has to have a 3D face model and has to have ""all 44 muscles in the model must move like human muscles"". Humans ""preform the same impressive calcualtion everday"". everybody had diferent facal expressions. "
358	because it could of bin made by dust and wind or a deid person from milions of years ago also it can be a rock formed as a face . 
359	 first i think that the face could of ben made up of dust and wind along time ago 
360	because we do not know what was in mars for a long period of time untill we invented satelights, rocket ships and space shutls next i say it could of also ben a deid person. one of the resons i say this is because in space a deid bode can not row or reprodus . 
361	last but not lest a rock could of den formed or a medeor crash thes are some of the things why i think it could not be aliens.            
362	"Many people are able to tell when a peer is angry pr sad but some people just have a blank face. The use of the software could help teachers understand their students,which in turn can help elaborate people's triggers and can lead to a better day.""In fact, we humans perform this same impressive ÂcalculationÂ every day.  For instance, you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face.  "
363	The same technology can make computer-animated faces more expressiveÂfor video games or video surgery. ÂMost human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication,Â notes Dr. Huang. ÂSo computers need to understand that, too.ÂEckman has classified six basic emotionsÂhappiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadnessÂand then associated each with characteristic movements of the facial muscles. For example, your frontalis pars lateralis muscle (above your eyes) raises your eyebrows when youÂre surprised; your orbicularis oris (around your mouth) tightens your lips to show anger. 
364	He feels that studying Venus even though its dangerous is valuable 
365	"because of the insight they could gain about the planet itself but also becuase ""human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors."" "
366	"In 2006 a trend began to grow in Europe, United States, and other places around the world to seporate auto use and the suburban life in to a movement called ""smart planning."" Most of the greenhouse gases emissions are up too 12 percent and is climing to greater than 50 percent in the United States and in Europe. Most of our development after World War II has be n centeredÂ  on the car or other means of transport. 80 percoent of laws have to highways and only 20 percent to other transport in the United States.  Many efforts in the past two or three decades have maade cities denser, and better for walking, planners and now taking the concept tho the suburbs. Homes to 5,500 residents within a rectangular square mile have to be advanced experimentin some low-car suburban life. the reason the usages of cars and other transportation would help the world and the the residents around you.  If there only 80 percent of appropriation have by law for highways and only 20 percent on other transport because lager role in a six-year federal tranaportation bills that are being put throw to be checked and aproved. The laws they have on transportantion and other means is to reduse the effects of the greenhouse effects that are happening are the world.  For the third stright year cars have been banned with only buses and taxis alound to dive during the day in countries around the world to reduce smog and greenhouse effects that happen. which if you think about the ideas that ae being share around the world with other countries the world is be comung less likely to be effected by the grren huse effects around the world.    "
367	he's giving us details about our focus, Venus. 
368	He explains that Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any other planet in the solar system even though the one planet being close to the sun is Mercury. This is something unique to say about Venus. 
369	"he says,"" Also notable, Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in the solar system."" "
370	This is something interesting to learn about Venus and thats how well the author supports the idea of studying Venus. 
371	Also the code can be kept for years, and would only need to to updated so we won't need to have multiple people tring to tell others how their facial expressions tells hows they are feeling. 
372	"A esample of this would be the classic of ""put a smile on your face"".  "
373	but that's not the point 
374	In this short story the authoer is sayiing thet it is not woth you time to study venus. it not with the time but it is a star that shines bright inthe sky at nigh time 
375	"The author said ""the value of returning to venus seems indisputable, but what are the opitions for making such a mission both safe and scientifically productive"". it not safe to send to someone int to space to venus becasue they do not know if they will be able to get them back to earth safely. for other reason, "" NASA's possible solution to the hostile condititons on the surface of venus would allow scientists to float above the roiling venusian landscape. with means that venus landscape it not good for people to be up ther on it surface, scientist do jnot know if there is right oxygen on that planet for humans to breath. With that  ""NASA is working on other approaches to study venus"", because they are now thinking that it not safe for them to send humans upp to space to get data for them because they don't know what it like on that planet or how the weather , the surface is for humans to be on it. NASA is goimg to be useing technology with they call "" mechanical computers"" to studdy the planet here on earth. but venus is now called"" the evening star brightest points of light in the night sky"". "
376	Doing this can help you be more aware of the people in need and help you know that you have been great help to them. This program hires men to take care of the horses, cows, and mules that were shipped over seas. This can make you come closer to the animals and let them know that you care very much for them! 
377	It can be on land or sea. You can have an adventure different countries with your free time when your finished your delivery with time to spare. The boat you travel on can even hold the beginning of an adventure. 
378	Sightseeing is something that can make you glad you toke up the job. The things you could see are things that you probably won't see at home. These sights can also teach you something about the country 
379	Exploring countries, towns, and cities is something you definetly should do on this job. You can even explore the ship. While exploring you can bring a friend to experience it with you. 
380	In the article the author taked about how venus is pursuit. 
381	in the article the the author said NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions o the surface of venus would allow scientitis to float above the fray. Imagine a blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the roiling venusian landscape. Ths quotes means thta venus is pursuit because is halping people wiht the electronic such as vehicule. 
382	a picture may be susposed to make you laugh but it only shows what the computer can do. 
383	The Mona Lisa picture is intended to make somebody smile but it only shows what the computer can do 
384	The creater of the picture has made more than one picture . You may not see anything in the picture that shows emotion but there is always something in his paintings . The Mona Lisa picture is 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted , 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry . She has many emotions not just one 
385	Even thought you may think the Mona Lisa may be boring it does show emotion but it is hard to find . New computer software has been made to inhance the picture .   
386	Ill be sumerizing the article over venus and why it is not we can not step foot on this planet. 
387	If Venus is so inhospitable why are scientists even discussing visits to its surface. Astronomers are fasinated by Venus because it may have been much like earth long ago. The planet has a surface of rocky sediments and includes familiar features such as vallies, mountains, and craters.  Striving to meet the challenge presented by venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the the planet itself. also because human curiosity will likelylead us into many equally intimidating endeavors. Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation. 
388	cell phone use can very deadly for teen drivers 
389	Venus is the second planet in line to the sun. Earth's twin is Venus, Venus is the closest planet to Earth in density and the size. Earth, Venus and Mars are neighboring planets they all orbit the sun at different speeds. No man has been on Venus NASA has tried to send spaceships up to Venus but the ships never survived the landing some did but they didn't make it past a few hours. Venus has never been touched by man. 
390	The auther has good pionts he claims the average temperature on Venus is over 800 degrees and that the atmosheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on Earth. 
391	Planets like ours and Mars. Mars is worth all the time, resorces and money to gonout and find more about because later in our life or in the furture Mars could be the next Earth. NASA has aldready claimed before they have found water and grass. Venus has nothing close due to its 800 degrees and the atomspheric is 90 times greater than ours so you can't breathe on Venus 
392	The auther made great claims but I feel we could foucs more on Mars and other planets like ours.  
393	You can learn who was the first to land on Venus and who was the last and how long you can stay on Venus until you have to come back down to Earth for more food and supples 
394	Only one spaceship can go up there because they can't have more than 3 to 4 people on Venus doing the same thing, they don't have that much room on the spaceship for everyone that wants to go on Vensu anyways. Not everyone knows about Venus but if you go to NASA websit and look up information about it you can learn more about the planets around us and see how you can become one of the people to go on the other planets that are around us or just become one of the members on the station.  
395	The average temperature is 800 degrees fahrenheit there so you would need a very high powered suit to keep that from killing you if you go to Venus. 
396	You get to meet new people and you get to try something new. If you think you like something else better you can always join that club. You might even be surprised by how much you like it. 
397	Many poeple are saying it looks as if it's a face or some sort. Some peopel are even saying aliens have put it on Mars to tell us soemthing, but I hilly dout that. 
398	He began to say that ailens put it there! 
399	They may not even be real, we have no evidence to show that soemthing living lives up on Mars. I had began to tell him that's it's not possiable! I even gave facts about how anything livinh like humans or animals couldn't live up there. But he still thought it was true.  
400	The face on Mars had been getting bigger and many poeple hadn't though aliens did it after reading my page. By doing so much research I sort of made a differnce about it and Im proud to say all the hard work turned out to be a amazing thing to do.            
401	Every people have different types of emotions. It's true that they have different kinds of emotions but what if it is fake? 
402	Computers are like robots. Computers can't prefer if someone is smiling or upset. Computers don't understand if someone is really smiling for real or faking smiling. It depends on someone's face. For instance, when a friend talk something fun, I smile but when a friend talk something boring, I smile too so they can be happy. 
403	"Not everybody can read someone's mind. In the last paragraph in the second sentence, it says, ""According to the Facial Feedback Theory of Emotions, moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions, but also may even help produce them"". "
404	It can be true, but it can be false. People don't know what is going to happen next. So people have to figure out on their own. So I disagree that about using of this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable. 
405	The school council is a great program. They all you the make statments for the schools. This is one of many choices to be a leader. School council is a great extracurricluar program for students it makes staments,and is a good choice to be a leader. 
406	So i think if the mom thinks the student needs to go to summer school that's her decion, students stay in school for 9 months a year so that's plenty of time to get everything they need done by summer. that can cause alot of disagreements with the family. Let's say the mom wants you to go to summer school but the dad thinks otherwise because yall already have plans to do somthing different, summer school can cause an arguement. 
407	It should be the parents decions why or why not. But if it was a teacher-designed more students would come and catch up on more work or somthing like that so it could also be good at the same point, for instence let's say your behide on a sol and have to gradute in the summer if you would of just went to summer school in ur highschool days maybe you wouldn't have to gradute in the summer. So it could go both ways i think but if your a student then you should know if you need to go to summer school or not because it won't be fair for your parents to know everything, you got a part in it to. 
408	Teens think it's cool when you drink and smoke and have to drive  Home if you are at a party and your friend drank too much and try to drive home Prevent it  Before she/he gets hurts and maybe die from a car crash.  
409	Hats when its fine but when you are backing backed make sure you look  Both ways left and right, it's like when you walk across the street you look both ways How to  Prevent car crashing, you have to look for children make sure you drive slow by schools or  When you close it's going to say slowly down school ahead. Keep at least one hand on the steel  Wheel. Do not drive with no hands it not cool or safe it can put you and danger, Make sure you  Have your seatbelt you can fly out the window and die just because you didn't put your seatbelt  On. Be courteous to the other drivers no one on the roads. so you should treat people with  Respect.   
410	"The passage alson states that Leonardo used knew how ""Mona Lisa"" felt when he was drawing her. At first he didn't know if she was smiling. But then he just let is go and began to draw. And now we are here, to the future and people wanting to knoww how another perosn feels by using a computer. "
411	Like i've stated before, change can go in a good or bad way. There is no way saying it could be both or could be something completly different. We just got to be careful with what we have now or they may be no future. 
412	This story is really about how many people studying about Mona Lisa and how the way her mood is. 
413	Some people try to study her history from back in the day because of why she dosent smile that often and why is she always angry.  
414	Some people perform an impressive calculation on her feelings by the look of her face. 
415	Conclusion: The whole story is about why people wonder why Mona Lisa never smiles that often. People uses lots of technology to try to figure out the way her mood was before she had 6 different emotions someone calls the person who knows lots of history about the story. Then they figure out that she did finaly smile during a painting class. By the look of her face the first time that someone notist lots of people were impressed it raised your eyebrows when you where surprised. Her smile really did change some back story about her first mood. 
416	I remember that one time I tried to convince some other people to join the program. It didn't go so well. 
417	" ""I don't like the sea air"", ""I hate the ocean"", "" I can't swim"", ""What we get tropedoed? I can't swim"", I have allergies to horses"". These are exuses I get when I try to convince other people to join the progam I am in. I did convince some, but not a lot. Most think that I am a creep. They try to get away from me. I am always sad when I see them walk away, but at least I tried. Eventuly I gave up trying to convince them.  So here I am, on the sea, thinking about the people that I tried to get them to join. Every time that I thought about them, I think about what they are doing right now. When I was discharged, I went off to find every single one of the people and tell about my journys. They always say the same thing. ""I wish I joined the program."" Then we have a good talk about what they did while I was overseas. I feel like that I have more friends than I used to before. "
418	ADD is a big reason too for people have no choice but to get distracted on things which cause crashes. 
419	Although some may disagree that student projects should be designed by teachers, it should be known that this is not true. 
420	"""Long ago, venus was probaly coverd in large oceans and could have supported varouis forms of life, just like earth today"". The planet has a surface temperature of 800 degrees farien height. Also the planet has a much higher atmospheric pressure at over 90 times greater than Earth. "
421	"Venus is closer to our plant than we thought. Even thought its atmosphere contains clouds that are made out of higly corrosive acid. ""The surface has a rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountians, and craters"". The terrian is showen to be ruff but not unbarable for human colonization. Also Venus is one the closest planets to own own planetthan most others. The due to the ground condtions being hostile surveyers would need to be located 30 or more miles above the surface of the planet. "
422	They were heading over to Europe because, many countries over there were ruined. So they were coming over to bring them food supplies, animals, and more 
423	When they unloaded the animals and were heading back there was an empty space. So sometimes the cowboys played games. Like baseball, volleyball, table-tennis, fincing, boxing, and more. Luke always enjoyed that part. 
424	"Mostly the primary car limiting factor is for not to pay for gasolineÂ  and gasolineÂ  taxes. In the United States the Eviromental Protection Agency is promoting ""car reduced"" comunnitiues to limit cars all around the world. The goverment expects buses and taxis to play a much better role on giving trasportation to citizens that cannot afford a car. The goverment says that 80% of the bills payment by them is going to fix highways and that only 20% of the other bills they use it for transport. "
425	Paris enforces a driving ban to clear the air of the global city. Motorist with numbered licensed plates were ordered to leave their cars at there house or pay a fine of 31$. For this enforces over 4,000 drivers were fined. More than 20 peoplae got theit cars impounded for their reaction to the fine of paris. Diesel fuel company was blamed since France has a tax policy that favors dieselÂ  over gasoline. Diesel fuel company makes up 67% of vehicles in France. For this kind of behavior Delivery companies complained for loss of buisness.  
426	Bogota and colombia set out as a program to spread out the car-free day leaving the sreets of this capital city clear of no traffic jams. The goal for this countries is to promote traspotantion and reduce the smog. The violators for these rules are going to be charged with 25% fine. UnevenÂ  sidewalks have been replaced by broad (smooth sidewalks), Rush our restrictions have dramatically cut traffic and new restaurants and upsacleÂ  shopping districsÂ  have croped up.  
427	The end of the car culture president obama ambitious goals is to curb the united states green house gas emmisions. Some recrent studies suggest that americans ar buyinga few more cars than usual, Driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by.Â        Â        Â     
428	The author is sayin sinse venus is basicly another copy of earth will extra extreme features, we should still look into it. 
429	Now people know that venus is not fit for life forms now. Even people who have gotten close anough to venus couldnt get even close to study the surface of venus. They dont get a whole lot of time to look at venus because of its light and how bright it is, if people attempted to take a photo of venus it would not come out how they wanted. They only way we get any idea of venus and its surface is from the human eye. We are never able to get close anough for samples because we would need to get extremely close and we cant because of its heat, gases. Venus could easily burn through most metals from earth, but astronomers think using old technology or a mechanical computer could help figure out more on venus. The mechanical computer actually doesnt involve electronical equipment. Thats how the parts to the mechanical computer is made, is by heat, pressure and other types of forces 
430	- Venus is a cloud draped planet, it is often referred as Earth's twin because Venus is the closest planet to Earth and sometimes Mars, humans sent spacecraft to Venus but unmanned because not one single spaceship has touched down in Venus in three decades, 
431	humans have to study everything about Venus because of Venus's reputation it is a very challenging planet. 
432	I'm stil shocked that people think they're real. I've never seen one before 
433	There would be a little chance of any human or life to live on venus 
434	On venus the planet reamins unliveable to human. In the many times they sent spacecrafts to venus, venus had claimed the lives of the people inside the spacecraft. Since then NASA would not send another space shuttle to venus and it has been like that for 3 decades now. 
435	"The planet venus also known as the ""Evening star"" is one of the brightes in the night sky. Venus is also like a twin of earth the characteristics of this planet is alike except for the speed and the size.  A thick atmosphere of about 97% of carbon dioxide covers the planet venus. When you pass that the surface of the earth is 800 degrees fahrenheit and verry deadly to any creacher that lives on earth. the atmospheric pressure is 90% than what we experience here. So why do scientist still study and figure out how life can form on this planet? well...Scientist want to study this planet because they believe it was similar and an earth-like planet. When the planet was and Earth-like planet it could have supported the life that lives on the actual earth now. On venus there were oceans,rivers,valleys,and ect. could we return to this planet? Scientist say that returning to earth is indisputable. Scients also want to figure out how they can send people there and be successfull? NASA want to design a blimp like vhical that can hover over venus without touching the unbarable ground but would give little insight of the planet. Scientist could not take samples of rock or gas or anything eles. Many researchers are tryin to come up with an idea so that they can get all their information on venus. "
436	In The Challenge of Exploring Venus the pursuit despite the danger the author include that thar are almost 97 percent of carbon dioxide is on venus and the temperes average over 800 dergrees fahrenheit. NASA is telling us like how it not liveabul on venus. venus has the hottest suface temperature of any plantet in our solar system. NASA has been sening thing to Venus but the hostile conditions on the surface of venus is bad so NASA idea for sending thing to venus is having vehicl hovering 30 or so mile above the roiling landscape. having vehicl hovering over the landscape of venus. 
437	The text also state even a vehicl will have so much time to hovering over venus because the light can't penetrate the dense atmosphere. More importantly resher can't take anything because it is dense atmosphere. Fot them to seeking any info thay would have to get up close and personal despite the risks. Having knowledge fo venus meney researcher are working on some simplifed electronice.  The National Aeronautis and space Administration have a idea for sending humans with haveing bad condush. At Venus temperatures would be around 170 degrees fahrenheit. Stat frome the text researchers are working on innvations that would alloe our mechines to last longer enought to contribute meningfully to our knowedge of Venus. NASA is working on other approaches to studying Venus. 
438	It may look like a face 
439	What it really is, is a natural landform that our viking took a picture of on one side of mars. 
440	"Luke was a solider in World War 1 and he was stationed in Europe,during this time war was going on and this wasn't the best time to visit there. But it's a more safe invorment and is known for it's history including the ""World War 1"". When you've had a lot going on at work, just want to do something nice for the kids,or even just tired of the weather a vaction is perfect for many reasons such as the ones I've mentioned. It's also very easy to become stressed and overwheled by work and school;its just best to take a break for it all. You can just go to a beach on an tropical Island or a jungle then come back to a fresh start ready to go,before you know you'll already be planing your next trip back or somewhere esle. You'll also get to meet new people around the world maybe you'll decide to move there. "
441	Why should this summer project should be student designed not teacher designed? If student have a choice of who came up an idea to write about they would most likely choose them self. This summer project due til student go back to school telling that student have lot of time to come up with an idea to write about. Student can come with an idea quickly because they can what they do and write about that they also can write what they do during the break 
442	Would'nt you love to be on a cattle boat and sail to unique places and help people in need? In the passage Luke does exactally that. 
443	I am not saying that when we want to search about emotions through technology there should not be anything on it. 
444	"A danger of ecploring Venus is that the temperature is very high that hummans might not handle, and has the hottest surface. ""On the planets surface, temperatures verage over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet.""  "
445	I like the idea of a havor craft to avoide the hot surface. 
446	Many cause of limited car usage tends to have less people on the streets. Near the French and Swiss borders ; streets and driveways and home garages were not allowed for free parking. It forced people to park in places where it was usually crowded. Most people did not like the parking rules. They either rode their bikes or walked back and forth to get to their destination. Later after that, many people were very upset with the parking rules, that alot of them decided to sell their car so they could park wherever and that had opened spaces for multiple cars to transpass the roads at the same time.  Same thing in Bogota, Columbia but the problem they had, was the pollution in the air. Columbians rode on buses with other people because the believed it was safer than being in a car and getting in an accident. Paris had the same problem, except they were fined to be driving. About 4,000 drivers were fined and others cars were to be impounded for arguing about being fined.  
447	I think the better way for the car problems, is to have all people discuss the problems and explain what is best for other people. 
448	In conclusion, the facial action of recognition is some how bad, because students can act different if they know that there is a digital system recording them all the time, and can be good for them to pay more attention in class. 
449	"Because Venus has all proprties that humans requied to inhabit.  Also, Venus had an extremely temperatures that humans can't survived.  As the author said ""the temperature of Venus pass the 170 degress fahrentheid"", this means that humans can't resist this temperatures.  Years ago scientist fund something interesting in Venus but also dangereous, venus can be inhabit???, how we can travel to Venus???  Also the Nasa do programs to send people to Venus and study the ecosism.  Venus the secund planet of the solar sistem. Scientis fund that Venus maybe can be inhabit, because they fund properties that Earth posees. But now Venus is like pangea, a dangerous planet with dangerous gasees, earthquakes, etc.  and now, the humanity want to know how to lived in Venus.  "
450	Venus is a planet that we can study, survived etc. But also it take a lot of time to do programs and prepare the people, also we are close to put the first step on Venus.  thank you.... 
451	"Tv and other things are what is drawing the attention to the matter andthey are whats broadcasting to the world that it is real. The text states "" It starred in a hollywood film , appeared in books , magazines, radio talk shows..."" "
452	The number of deaths increase everyday do to drinking and driving as well. There is a specific time you can drive after drinking which is 5 hours to sure you're ok to drive without causing a crash. Which makes thousands of people dangerous drivers everyday fights the public!!!  
453	"The ""Face on Mars"" was found during a search for a possible landing site for the sister ship of Viking 1,  Pictures were taken during the search, a showy likeness of a human face was spotted.  An enourmous head close to two miles from end to end, was looking back at the camera.  Scientists believed it was just another Martian mesa, common around a region of Mars called Cydonia. But it had unusual shadows that made it look similar to an Egypt Pharaoh.  The ""Face on Mars"" is a huge rock formation, which resembles a human head.  Shadows gave the illusion of eyes, a nose, and a mouth, and because of this, it caused alot of attention to Mars. People believe that it was an alien monument, but proof showed that it was, just a natural landform. "
454	"Few Scientists believe the Face was an alien artifact.  Photographing Cydonia and the Face became a priorty for NASA.  Eighteen years after the Viking missions ended, Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) arrived at the Red Planet in September, 1997.  On April 5, 1998 Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, Michael Malin, and his Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) team took a photo ten times sharper than the original Viking Photos in 1976.  Thousands of web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site. To no surprise at all, revealed . . . a natural landform. No alien monument after all, Just rocks.  When the photo was taken it was winter in April '98. A cloudy time of year on the Red Planet. The camera on board MGS had to look through wispy clouds to see the Face, skeptics believe that because of this the alien markings were hidden. As said in the article  ""Malin's team captured an extraordinary photo using the camera's absolute maxium resolution.""  The pixels in the 2001 image spans to 1.56 meters.  While the best 1976 Viking photo had 43 meters per pixel.  In a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size, if there were objects on the ground in this picture, you could see what they were just by looking at it.  The picture shows the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa, commonly found around the American West.  ""It reminds me of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho,"" says Garvin ""That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars."" "
455	"In the year 1976, when Viking 1 space craft was taking photographs of possiable landing spots for Viking 2 spacecraft, they found a formation in a rock that looked like a human face. The shadows made the rock look like it had a nose, mouth, and two eyes, like a human. This was found in a region of the Red Planet called Cydonia. The ""Head"" was nearly two miles from end to end, and it seemed to be starring back at the cameras.  The controllers back at the Jet Propulsion Lab were probably quite surprised when this face popped up on their screens, looking them right in the eyes. This sensation was short lived. Scientist figured it was just another Martian mesa, which was common around Cydonia. The only difference with this one is it had unusal shadows that made it seem like an Egyptian Pharaoh. A few days later NASA unveiled the image for the public eye to see. The caption on this picture was ""Huge rock formation... which resembles a human head.... formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes,nose and a mouth."" NASA'S reasoning was that the picture would help engage public attraction to Mars.  This public picture was soon a pop icon. It starred in Hollywood films, was in books, magazines, talk shows on the radio, and even haunted grogery store checkout lines for over 25 years. Some people think that this picture is evidence of life on Mars. Conspiracy theorist say that this is information NASA would rather hide. Defenders of the NASA budget wish that there was life on Mars, as this would make NASA more popular, and even richer, when people use the picture in books, movies, magazines, and more.  Although most scientist believed the face was an alien artifact, photographing Cydonia became a priority to NASA, when Mars Global Surveyor arrived at the Red Planet eighteen long years after the Viking missions ended. Jim Garvin, cheif scientist, said that they felt like it was a right of taxpayers to see photographs of the face as soon as possiable. On April 5, 1998, Michael Malin snapped a photograph ten times sharper then the old one. This became popular with web surfers, as they were waiting for the first photo to show up on a JPL website. Only this picture showed what they were not wanting, a natural landform. This was not an alien momument after all.  While most people were satisfied, others were not. They still think that NASA is still hiding evidence of an alien momument. The Face on Mars is located at 41 degrees north martian latitude where it was winter in April 1998. The camera on board MGS had to peer though whispy clouds to see it. Perhaps, said skeptics, alien markings were hidden behind clouds on purpose, so that humans would not be able to see them. Mission controls planned to take another photograph of it. It is not easy work, and it is not easy to target Cydonia. They just do not pass the face very often.  Nevertheless, on April 8, 2001, a cloudless summer day in Cydonia, MGS drew close enough for a second veiw. They had to roll the spacecraft 25 degrees to center the face in the field of view.  They used the cameras highest resolution. Each pixel in the 2001 image spans at 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Vikings photo.""As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image three times bigger than the pixel size. So if there were objects on the ground such as airplanes or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could have seen what they were"" Said Jim Garvin.  What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa, which are landforms that are common around the American West. ""It reminds me of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho"" Says Garvin. ""Thats a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height of the Face on Mars."" He added. "
456	However, it is highly imposable for it to be an alien momument, as they would have to have oxygen to survive,and they would have to find plenty of food and water to also survive. 
457	"Heres a qoute from the article "" even thought individuals often show varying degrees of expression"" (like not smiling as broadly). Each expression is compared against a neutral face (showing no emotion).    "
458	There is something good to it. It can make them try new stuff. 
459	It can get them interested new jobs they can try. A new future they can try to achieve. it could also make them a more interesting person. More possible people talk to about the topic. But they could despiseÂ the topic. 
460	Than forcing them in to it could make the hate it more. 
461	There could be some personal stuff that do's not let them join a club. some personal trauma that makes them less likely to join a club. it could also be that they just dont want to do it. Being part of a sports team is also very physicallyÂ demanding. 
462	There is always chance they could not make it on the team 
463	Plus there is always a chance of being kicked out of the club or team. Plus if you try a sport out and figure out that you dont like it you can always quit. There is always a chance that the club could not even help you in the real world. There could be no real world implication 
464	It 'll work the same I'm sure. We would have solar powered appliences so we wouldn't have to sorry about the everyday hassal of having to plug in, detangle, of trip over any more cords. This would be a major change for all of us drastic in fact, but still survivable. NASA has had some simpified electronics made of silicon carbide that have been tested in a chamber simulated the Venus's surface and has lasted for three weeks in such harsh and mild conditions 
465	NASA would be making our living situations a lot easier to handle of Venus by creating all of this new technology today in this age/era 
466	so if you ever want to put theses in classroom's give it to one class to try them out and if they like it use but if they don't u can't do anything but make something better or something just like give it a diffenert name and shape, and size stuff like that beacuse you don't want to give it to a person that dose not like the idea of using it. say you have three classroom's and u want to see what's the odds of these classroom's using these so you test them for like 3 weeks see how use it see if they like do they need help using them so i think it would be great to have in classrooms as long as they like them and know's how to use them is the biggest part of this new product. 
467	I thought that was perpostourous but my colleague still believed the theory of aliens existing. 
468	There was no technology back when the Mona Lisa was made. They had pictures and the picture showed emotion. There are some people that can see the emotions of people and some are herd to see then others. 
469	They are making technology to read the emotional expressions and that it knowns when your lieing. 
470	There are pictures that show emotion, 
471	people that see other peoples emotion, 
472	and now there making technology that reads emotional expressions. 
473	First, of there are pictures of people and there always will be. In those pictures you can see someones emotion and how someone is feeling. 
474	Back then they only had pictures to see. From theose pictures most artist and people could see peoples emotions, but it was meanly the artist that could read someones emotion. The artist could see throw someones fake smile or if it was real. That's why there pictures showed how many emotion she had. 
475	Next, there are some people that can read others emotion and for it's hard or they can see them. 
476	Everybody is different most people that read somebody's emotion is because there a love one or a every good friend and they can read your emotion. There is just other people that don't care. Most people should be able to see if your angry, sad or happy. Those emotions are easy to see, kids show it all the time even when there not feeling so good. 
477	Finaly, there is technology being made that reads someones emotion. The technology even know's when it is a lie. 
478	So somebody can just take a picture of somebody and there emotion. There is going to be a person that lie's the technology. Technology isn't going to make you feel better. That person is going to need a love one or a close friend, to help them ou 
479	There always going to be somebody close by that will help you out. Could be throw a picture and that could help you. Or a friends that sees you happy, sad, or mad. The technology might tell them there emotion, but wont help them out. There are pictures that show emotion, people that see other peoples emotion, and now there making technology that reads peoples emotional expressions.         
480	because you make new friends 
481	you help out your school 
482	it creates other opportunities 
483	"Another example that the author used that was included that was good was in paragrah one when it states that ""Shes 83 percent happy, 9percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry. This shows that the author included logos in his paragrah another way of having a valuable short. "
484	Third example has pathos catching peoples feelings or making them think being put into someone els shoes. 
485	"Hold on! can we actually ""calculate""emotions-like math homework? and how can a computer recognize the subtle facial movements we humans use to express how we feel"". The author also gave us examples of looking in the mirror. I think that the author gave details examples for the student to having in the classroom. "
486	Driver good is very important for all people. In the united states' there areÂ  much car and this provoke much accidents in the life of the people. The president Obama's say: in the united states' greenhouse gas emissions, unveiled last week, will get a fortuitous assist from an incipient shift in american behavior: recent studies suggest that americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by.  In the united states peaked in 2005 and dropped steadily thereafter, according to an analysis by doug short of advisor perspectives, an investment research company. As april 2013 the nombers of miles driven per person was nearly 9 percent below the peak and equal to where the country was in January 1995. Part of the explanation certainly lies in the recession,because cash-strapped Americans could not afford new cars, and the unemployed weren't going to work anyway.''I think means something more fundamental is going on''.The transportation is the second largest source of Ameica's emissions, just behind power plants. But it could have negative implications for thr car industry. Diferent things are converging which suggest that we are witnessing a long -term cultural shift, said Mimi Sheller, a sociology professor at drexel university and director of its mobilities research and policy center. She cities various factors:the internet makes telecommuting possible feel more connected without driving to meet friends. The precident Obama is very good with the country because this words what he say ser very important for the all people and the world.    
487	"In paragraph 4 it says ""Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with Oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth.  The author also states that, Today, Venus still has some features hat are analogous to these on Earth. The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, maountains, and craters. They recall that Venus can sometimes be our nearest option for a planetary visit, but a crucial consideration given the long time frames of space travel. In paragraph 5 it informs us that NASA says, that the visit would not have easy conditions, but survuvable for humans.  In paragraph 1 the author tells us that, Venus, sometimes called the ""Evening Star,"" si one of the brightest points of light in the sky, easy even for an amateur stargazer to spot. Although, this nickname is misleading since Venus is actually a planet. The author also claims that Venus is the second planet from our sun. It has proved a very challenging place to examine more closely. Also referred to as Earth's ""twin,"" Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size, occasionally the closest in distance too. The author also says ""Earth, Venus, Mars, our other plaetary neighbor, orbit the sun at different speeds. These differences in speed mean that sometimes we are closer to Mars and other times to Venus."" He also states that Venus is sometimes right arounf the corner, in space terms.  In paragraph 2 the author claims ""Numerous factors contribute to Venus's reputation as a challening planet for humans to study, despite its proximity to us."" He also states that NASA has sent numerous spacecrafts to land on this cloud- draped world. Each previous mission was unmanned, and for a good reason, since no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours. Maybe this issue explains why not a single spacecraft has touched down on Venus more than three decades ago."" But NASA is still studying how they could get a better way to study Venus. "
488	(UNRRA hired seagoing cowboys to take care of the horses,youngcows,and mules that were shipped overseas.) 
489	So there are 3 reasons that I wrote out of why you should be a seagoing cowboy and if your a girl I suppose you could be a seagoing cowgirl. Now I am not forcing you to but just convincing you and I hope that convinced you because all of it is really true. So if you don't want to that's fine but if you do Great I didn't write all of that for nothing! 
490	The way that i see it is that the author put a lot of reseach into venus and study it 
491	some scientist still today though study the plant. And trying to find a way to go there but the tests that there getting back isnt good 
492	So as there doing more tests they find out more things about the plant and try to look for a way to reach venus and to finally land on it . And to find out more stuff about venus up close . 
493	"The other thing is they found out about venus is that "" a thick atomsphere of 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets venus"" according to the article "
494	And so that means that they also have to find out whats wrong with the air and how can they live in it 
495	venus wont really be safe for us .

501	Venus is actually a planet. in our system solar. Venus is the second planet from our sun. Venus is the closest planet planet to Earth in terms of density and size. Venus is sometimes we are closer to  Mars and others time to Venus. On the planet's surface, temperatures averange over 800 degrees fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater. Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system.  Venus was probably covered largely with Oceans and could have supported varios forms of life just like earth, today Venus still has some features that are sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains and craters, furthermore, recal that Venus can some times be our nearest option for aplanetary visit people like visit at planet Venus they want know about the planet. The scientists say tha planet is delete at de solar system because Venus is a little planet in solar system it was delate. approaches to studying Venus. for example, some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of venus's surface and lasted for trhee weeks in souch conditions. human curiosity know more about Venus the little planet in solar system. In planet Venus there not are life, people can live there at the planet Venus, Only in this planet are life. 
502	First of all, about 97 percent of a thick atmosphere blankets Venus are carbon dioxide. 
503	Secondly, the average temperatures of Venus is over 800 degrees Fahrenheit. 
504	Finally, the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what they experience on Earth. 
505	In addition, beyond high pressure and hean, Venusian geography and weather present additional impediments like erupting volcanoes, powerful eathquakes, and frequent lightning strikes to probes seeking to land on its surface. 
506	"""Beyond high pressure and hean, Venusian geography and weather present additional impediments like erupting volcanoes, powerful eathquakes, and frequent lightning strikes to probes seeking to land on its surface""(Paragraph 3).  "
507	"The process begins when the computer constructs a three-dimensional computer model of the face. All forty-four major muscles in the model must move like a human muscle. Movement of one or more muscles is called an ""action unit."" The facial expressions we use for each emotion is universal. The software can identify mixed emotions.  The software is the latest innovation from Professor Thomas Huang. Dr. Huang and his colleague are experts at developing better ways for humans and computers to communicate. He then relies on his pyschologist Dr. Paul Eckman, the creator of Facial Action Coding System. He has classified six basic emotions like happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness.  In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"", it tells us how a new technology called the Facial Action Coding System enables computers to identify human emotions. ""Why would they want this? "
508	I think that the author has a good point her beacuse it teaches the reading that Mars is not the only chicos with this we get to see that ther is other chicos that we can pick if one day we have to leave plant earth. Venus is a instreting plant because its sometimes cloeser to us then mars and it can help understand how to take care of earth. With this we get to see what we can change and what. We dont need to change about our plant Earth and what we do need to chance. Earth is a good plant but Venus is a plant that we dont fully understand as most plants Venus is a plant that is new to the human kind. 
509	What Venus have that we dont which is good that the envioment can cush a submarin and the conditions. That it might not let a human leave in Venus is dangerous. But can be really helpful like if its amosphere is so strange can take some samples and can use it to help the earth be more protective. It can help us understand why its like and if one day and see if some one can live up there. Vensu us the hottest sureface temperture in our whole solors system which is perrt col if you ask me its hooter then the summer on the earth because its cloers to the sun. 
510	We need to watch it closly to send people up there and see if tis right for humans. but yeah i think that Venus is a cool plant to study more cloly because its reaslly insterting to see how a differtn platn works everyday. We need to study it more so we cansee why its called the Evening Stare why its cloer to the sun why we need to talk about more to peepole so they may see how insterting is to study a plant like Venus.   
511	"I love being able to go out on the sea and have fun will helpping people with there problems make me super happy and I wouldn't have this job if my friend didn't tell me about it. For example (the world war11) I got to go to many places like China, Europe, and Italy.  I was happy to help all this people with there problems and when we got to go on a ship, we had the opportunity to take turns to watch over the animals at night to feed them and to make sure that nothing bad is happening like fighting our the bottom of the ship is being filled up with water.  So I signed up to watch them and so I got the job. I had to stay up super late to watch them and to I went to tell the captin that every thing was okay and so on my way I slipped on some water and I fell.  I had almost fell overboared but I didn't, thanks to a peice of meatel on the side of the boat and i was happy that I didnt die. I am thankful that I am still alive after breaking my ribs, and slidding down a latter. I soon recovered and was back to the job and so we took all the animals back to were they were.  So we made a game place were they were. We played a whole bunch of games and we did are ruiten, until we had another jod were we had to go get animals and watch over them. I am thankful to be able to do this job with people who care about me and support me well this job.  I wonder what are next job will be? Will I break another bone in my body? Can I survie another animal watch? Will I survie breaking another bone in my body? I don't know if i can survie another bone in my boby that can be broken?  After about a month we get a call to go get some animals and so we went to go get them and I have to say it was a long ride to go to Teaxs and it was close to were my uncle lived and so we got there and there was a huge sand storm and so we had to go get alll the horses, and take them to the sea and then I relized that my uncle had this one horse and it did not like me at all. As we were getting the horses around I seen that horse. The captin asked me if I wanted to watch the animals that week and I said "", Yes I will'. So I was up all night watching all the horses and so I had to feed them. I was feed the one horse that hated me the most and it kicked me right in the neck as I was feeding him. I was out for a really long time and my best friend came down there and found me on the floor ""sleeping"". "
512	"The author suggests that studying venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it present."" "
513	"vening star is one of the brightest points of light in the night sky, making it simple for even an anmateur stargazer to spot"". this quote is telling us that the eveing star is really bright and its the most beautyfull star of all stars in the sky.  ""often referred to as earths twin venus is the closest plant to Earth in terms of density and size and occasionally the closest in distance too"". this quote is showing us the closest planets to the Earth. venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar sysrem, even though mercury is closer to our sun. The national aeronautice and space administration NASA has one particularry compelling idea for sending humans to study venus. NASA possible solution to the hodtile conditions on the surface of venus would allow scientists to float above the fray. imagine a blimp like vehile hovering 30 or so miles above the roiling venusain landscape. At 30 plus miles above the surface temperatures would still be toasty at around 170 degrees fahrenheit but the air pressure would be close to that sea level on earth. Solar power would be plentiful and radition would not exceed earth levels not easy condition but survivable. "

515	Another reason why computer show be allowed to scan emotions is because the software can identify mix emotion. 
516	"Its said by Dr. Huang,"" The facial expression for each emotion is universal even though individual often show vary degree of expression."" The software uses video imagery, the emtion-recognition software track there facial movement in a real face or a painted face. "
517	Your principal has decided that all student's must participate in at least one extracurricular activity. I would do anything to help out people in need for what ever they want me to here i will be there for there need or whats i will be there in spirit. 
518	There are some flaws to this program.  Its very dangerous. 
519	Personally I am against this because I would love to know what everyone is feeling if they asre my frien oir not and know the real reason why they are acting the way they are no matter if they are sad or happy. 
520	Also NASA has no reason to try to cover up any civilization that we may not know about because they will be benifiting from that with more tax money from the government 
521	The reasons why NASA would not want to cover or hide an ancient civilization on Mars up is because they would clearly benifit from the sitiuation. 
522	"Defenders of the  NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars."" Also part of the reason they even made this picture avalible to the public is to bring attention to mars. "" The authors reasoned it would be a good way to engage the public and attract attention to Mars."" If they wanted to cover this ""Face"" on Mars up there would have never been a photo releasead to the public so every one can look at and study. "
523	After all of that information about NASA and how they would benifit from a ancint civilization on. Mars there is no absalutly no reason NASA would cover this up if they were going to benifit from the possibility of an. Ancient civilization on a planet that does not even have life today. 
524	most of the time if oyu are not careful and don't look oyu could get hurt and the fall off the ship 
525	oyu have to be ready though cause if you are not you might not know what is going on for every body. 
526	In some places, such as Vauban, Germany, have given up their cars 
527	The face is a very mysterious thing 
528	It's not every day you see something resemble a face on a planet. There are many people out there that believe it is just a natural landform. People think that because there are many landforms on Earth that resemble a face so why think that aliens did it just because it is on another planet. Also they might not belive in aliens. 
529	So they start to think what could have created that. Since it is on Mars they instantly think aliens. They think aliens because they can't think of what else could cause that and they think aliens can do crazy things like shape the land. Also people read things from newspaper articles that talk about it and watch movies about aliens and see them do crazy things like shape the land and other crazy things. 
530	People who think the face is just a natural landform probably think the people that believe aliens made it are crazy. 
531	Another example is when I get older I want to be a cosmataligist. 
532	Some people may want to be one also. Others might think the opposite. When I was a kid I use to play with doll's hair and watch YouTube videos on how to die hair, cut hair, and also brush hair the right way. 
533	How i feel about this article talking about having a piece of technology that could show and tell you what people are feeling is pretty crazy.  
534	because if you are Seagoing Cowboy you only have to work a couple hours a day.  
535	Im all for the values of using this new emotion technology because you tell if people are faking a smile. You can tell because when you fake it you dont use the same muscles as when you really smile. When you fake smile the muscles you use are zygomatic major that make your mouth stretche sideways and the risori. But when you really smile you use the muscles called zygomatic major that begin at your cheek bones and life the corners of your mouth. The other muscle you use is called orbicularis oculi pars palpabraeus which makes crow's-feet around your eyes.  
536	venus a very intresting planet to explore so maybe one day we will be able to visit tis place and search for samples and look for unkown elements. 
537	It is sutable to assume that NASA will still try to explore venus. And figure if their is a way to explore it and venture to et samples and find eelements and reduce the dangers in venus. 
538	The Mona Lisa demonstration is really intended to bring a smile to are face, while in the computer it shows it in how much it can do 
539	In the computer imagine know when we are happy or even sad for example, if we smile when a Wed ad appears on are screen, a similar ad might follow. But if we frown, the next ad will be different.  When we are looking in the mirror:  * raise your lips at the corner of your mouth,  * when you squint your eyes slightly, to produce wrinkling at the corner of your eyes,  * when you hold it, rise the outer pars of your cheek up, toward your eyes,  In fact, these are instructionws for a face that looks happy.  In a real smile, the zygomatic major (muscles that begin at yourt cheek bones) lifts the corner of you mouth. (that's out instruction #1.)  Meanwhile, muscles called orbicularis oculi pars palpabraeus make crow's-feet around your eyes. But in a false smile, the mouth is stretched sidways using the zygomstic major and a different muscle, the risorius. 
540	Theoty of Emotion, Moving are facial muscles not only expresses emotions, but also may even help produce them 
541	in what you are feeling that day and how you felt last night, you show emotion at school, work, even at your own house. Emotion are express in how your day was, your emotions is like a tv show in how but act you fell what they feel if they are happy, mad, sad, or even scard.   
542	Secondly, this technology can make video games or video surgery alot more expressive. 
543	student would also have time on their projects. 
544	The National Aeronautics and Space Administration has one particularly compelling idea for sending humans to study Venus. NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditiond on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray. If you image blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or more miles above the roiling Venusian landscap, it would be a shocker. Temperatures would still be tasty at around 170 degrees Fahrenheit, but the air pressure would ber close to the level of the sea and Earth. 
545	I think the autors statement on this is that when the temperature drops its very hard to communitcate with people going up there, but when it cools down its better for them. 
546	The Earth and Beyond it should not be limited by dangers and douts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation.  There devices were the first envisioned in the 1800s an playedan important role in the 1940's during World War ll. The thoughts of computers in those days did caulations for them, which in today's years we know thing about. Many of the reserchers of the NASA is working on other approches to studying Venis. Like some are simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus' surface and have lasted for three weeks in such conditiond. There a lot of projects that there looking back to an old technology called mechanical computers. Using mechanical parts can be made more resistant to pressure, heat, and other forces. 
547	I think the rock that landed in mars was meybe because it had came from a diffrent place or maybe because the rock was to old or to heavy. 
548	The rock may have move to Mars or landed in Mars maybe because something hit it and it just went to a diffrent place and it landed in Mars.  The rock maybe have laded and make or had a face shape from the way it landed. Im not so sure if it had landed like that to make a face shape. That's what I am thinking, is that it was like that from the way it had moved or it had changed. Some pople are surprised that they haved found a human face in the or in a planet. I know its kinda wierd but u never know what could happen.  They say it had a human face. They say it had eyes and it had a nose and it had a mouth in the face. They should be scared because what if it was aliens that did that and that made the face. I would be scared but maybe it wasent the aliens maybe it was just regular. It just could've been Something regular or sothing natural that just happen. 
549	NASA, could just be saying this to get attention, but mabey not. Even if there was alein landform on mars, we will not be able to know for sure 
550	Like any history, we only know through drawings or writing,and the only evidence we have is this face. Hopfully there will be more to find in near future. Or mabey evcen drawings will appear that we can interpit. If not, then all of NASA still has evidence that there could be 
551	I am here because I am giving my opinion on whether students should have to participate in an extracurricular activity 
552	Disigning better stronger drones that survive harder condicions such as Venus is a good thing because there could be other planets that could require that type of drone. 
553	Can you imagine a computer guessing everyones emotions, and tell wether their sad, happy, confused, etc. Well a 3-D computer can model all 44 major muscles. 
554	Dr. Paul Echman the creater of FACS has classified six basic emotions happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. using video imagery the computer can track these facial movements, the software can even recongnise mixed emotions. Inorder to identify all movements of one or more muscles is called an action unit. Using video imagery and recognising the facial movements the software can identify mixed emotions each expression is compared against a nuetral face. Every human can make the same face everyday, but you can probably tell when your friend is sad or happy just by looking at their face. While for somepeople its hard to tell when their friends feel happy, sad, confused etc. Dr. Huang got a picture of the Mona Lisa and made people look at it to tell if a computer can recognize your feelings. They also showed people a web ad that appears on a computer screen, If the person frowned the ad would change and when you smile a similar ad would appear. Dr. Huang predicts that a classroom computer will recognize when a staudent is becoming bored or confused.      
555	I belive this cause how are we ever going to know the truth if we don't go and find it out for ourselfs 
556	What really extist was there once life form on Venus. If so whendid they die or are they still there 
557	We have our theory about other life out in space, of the once vallys, mountains and the carter on the surface of Venus so that we have our theory that once a long long time ago there once were a form of life on Venus 
558	Now we have to think about how they lived, how they got their food, how they did all the thing sthat we as humans do but on a planet that has low gravit pulling you down. On Earth we have a greater about of gravit pull us down to the ground than Venus does. Earth has also more water than Venus does now, but what if that was to change . What if the planet Venus had more water than Earth. What if Venus and better things than Earth does. Then why did Venus died what had to happen to whipe out and whgole plant that had maybe life form of some sort and that we know had water and enough oxygen to have the livingh life form of some kind to kive there. So what did happen to the planet Venus. How did this onbce living planet now become with no life form of any kinds 
559	Whatif ther are other life form living on Venus still but we just dont know what they are or how they came about there are hunders of thing that we as human we have not yet discover. An maybe will never discover about how we got to where we are today. How we have got what we have today. These are thing that we may never truthy understand about where we came from. How we got to this day in time and how are we going to live these thing are unknown, till the end of time.  
560	The author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents because the planet itself is dangerous 
561	Venus has a thick atmoshpere, so it makes it harder to breathe. 
562	Exploring and studying the planet Venus is actually challenging when you think about it 
563	No spacecraft can even touch the ground on planet Venus 
564	In conclusion, these are the reasons why the author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents.   
565	You just have to think about it, those characteristics are obvious. I mean yes, it was found in Mars, but that doesn't mean it couldn't have been a human. People just have to think more into the possible and not the impossible, because everything is possible.  
566	But if you don't take the bus you will have to be picked up by 4:30 and then you be home and do whatever you want to do. But if your parent can pick you after school you could leave at the normal time school gets out and if your not feeling good you could also leave at the normal time. But before you could anything you have to do your homework and then go to your after school club. 
567	But you could get kicked out if your being bad and you will have to serve a punishment cause your still on school grounds. Like you you hit a student you will get suspended but if you hit theÂ teacherÂ you will get expelled.  If your playing sports it is all year long until the season ends, if your coach finds out your is taking drugs you will get kicked of the team. You will have the same rules as a high school cause you probably play for the high school team. But it won't costs any money cause the principal made us join the clubs so we could do something after school. Most likely we will find our hobby forever cause we are going to do it for the rest of the semester. If you find something that someone is doing and you want to do it just tell the teacher cause they will put you guys together. 
568	That's amazing how a computer can express how we feel .I 'm so surprized that a computer can do that. I some time ask myself how do they do that. 
569	I think that computers would need a lot of energy to do that I don't know it's amazing. I sometimes think that it is not impossible for this to happen but it really is. I think about all the gadgets that my mom had back then. I would usually say that they're going to make alot of different things in the future. Their already trying to make self-driving cars.  This story is amazing. I think that there are going to be more things that are going to surprise me. This one is the first greatest techonolgy I ever heard about. When I grow up I dont want to use all of this technology because I think that it is to much for me. I would consider only using something simple. 
570	This story told me alot. It told me what a computer could do that i never knew about which is surprizing. I just told my story about how i'd feel about all this new technology. That story was interesting and I think that I would probably use that one day. If I would use it I would be careful with it. 
571	in the beginning of the story it is saying that the people and cars are able to work together because it will stay there and be with them most of that. 
572	Then there are the casws of the underly populate areas in a city so they might go and vreate an area for them to live and play around in. They might have just gotten taken in as if the were to go and drive or even walk with them for as long as possnle. Then there are the way some of them that are driving a certain car for a time being until they were able to help the enviornment that is neer by. Then in the second passage it is saying that people will try to use there cars less so that the smog will go fading little by little or is it going to start to disapate. I must say that it might take a while until they might have made it at the time they could have done it so they might even try to create a day when no one will be using a car so they might get a better life and they might be able to pervent smog also and they might get to a part of the atmoshere and depleat the ozone layer making the sun even harsher for us. So these are the things about the people that were trying to stop the bad effects on the inviornment.  
573	We could argue and argue about this subject but if I was a scientist I would make a camera that could go farther and depper into mars outmasphere so we could see what was going on for some days to mounths to see what would happen if nothing happend then I would be right if we seen aliens there then he would be right.  But it would be alot easyer said then done to make that camera that can go that far into space to see that much for that long it would not be a easy task. But for the sack of seeing if aliens were real then it would be worth making to see if aliens are real or not. Because that would change every thing that we now about a different life force then use. It would blow up I would become famus nowing im the one that made the camera. 
574	And not even that i would prove that guy in the lab wrong that it is not even aliens that it is just sand and rock. 
575	But It would be pretty cool to see aliens and we only seen this way back in 1976 I wonder how long it has been there it could be billions to only 40 years old. But i would get to work to see if i could build the camera to send to mars and see what was going on on mars. And if I was to build it and if it would work I would keep it there on mars untill it ran out of battries and if there was yto be nothing then I would be right but if there was to besomething then that guy from the lab would of been right.  
576	But that is what i woud do if I was a sientist that worked for NASA abd there was a big argument about what it was then that is what I would do to see just make a camera to see which one was right me or the guy in the lab. Hopfully I would even be able to build that if i was a scientist that worked for NASA.      
577	getting them food,water, animals,and more. They lost thing in the war,so cloths on them can be good. They will be so thankful for your help. That will be alsome to do. 
578	You could bring your friends and family and you could work together. You could make someone day shine with a smile. You could look around the ocean and look for animals. That what would be fun.  
579	This could help it so much. We could change people's lives by doing this. This is a important job for people, because it could keep people from dieing. 
580	I always did love taking care of animals and doing other stuff as a crew of the Seagoing Cowboys.  I am here because many people argue whether be a Seagoing Cowboys is something you should do. 
581	With a time like this, your country needs you most. 
582	You will see Europe, China, and even Greece. You an even take a gondala ride in Venice, Italy, or marvel at the sight of the Panama Canal. You can see th Acropolis in Greece and castles in Crete. But those are not the only benifits. 
583	When we unload the animals, We often do things to pass the time where we used to keep them. Games like baseball, volleyball, and even table-tennis tournaments.  We sometimes do boxing, fencing, whittling, reading, and other games. 
584	When you join the Seagoing Cowboys you will open up a world of opportunities. But it is much more than just an adventure, it opens up the world to you.

586	"In America, we use vehicles on a daily basis to get around.Â  You either drive a vehicle that you own, ride a bus, take a taxi, ride a bike, or walk.Â  It is rare to see someone walking or riding a bike these days, but that is because we are so dependant on motor vehicles.Â  If you take a look at other countries, you will realize that they are taking steps to cut back on the use of motor vehicles to help stop pollution.  It is uncommon in the U.S. for a whole town of people to ""give up"" their cars, let alone pay $40,000 for a parking space and a house.Â  In Vauban,Germany, this ""smart planning"" movement was introduced to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions and the amount of cars in the area.Â  ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,"" said Heidrun Walter, a mother of two and media trainer.Â  70 percent of families living in Vauban do not own cars and walk or ride bikes to reach their destinations.Â  The town is not completely ""car free,"" there is a main thoroughfare that runs from downtown Freiburg.Â  Considering the town was only built about ten years ago, they are helping our environment in a big way.  Smog is a big problem in Paris,France.Â  After several days of ""near-record pollution,"" Paris temporarily baned driving to clear the cities air.Â  About 4,000 drivers recieved a 22-euro fine and 27 of those drivers had their cars impounded because of their reaction to their fine.Â  The fine worked and the cities congestion was down to 60 percent after five days of the smog.Â  The cities weather was part of the reason why there was so much smog, but some people believed it had to do with the diesel fuel that was used throughout France.Â  The public transit was free from Friday to Monday, but the smog eventually cleared and the band was lifted.Â      Â     "
587	He lists the good of what would happen with some facts 
588	Do we want to risk someone just to explore a plant, when we haven't fully explored ours? What sence does that make? 
589	The reason is that as it stated in the article, the face is to attrack the people. 
590	The first reason to support my claim is that the face is use to attrack people, so that the people who made up the idea can earn the money 
591	Students want summer to be homework free, and not have to worry about summer projects. Most students will agree that summer is meant to give the brain a rest. Meant to give students time to have fun, be free, and enjoy the few months before school starts up again. 
592	Although some may disagree, schools should require summer work for students.  
593	Humans have sent numerous of spacecrafts to venus but for inly a couple of hours. Which actually is a good idea because not one single spaceship was able to go back to Venus more then three decades ago. Venus is almost 97 percent carbon dioxide. Venus planet surface is almost 800 degrees  Farenheit.  The conditions are far more extreme then anything humas encounter on Earth. 
594	Venus could have probably be covered in large amounts of oceans and could have been supported by humans. It could be hard ot go back to Venus becuase of the pressure that spaceship could get. In order to go back, they have to try and make the mission both safe and scientifically productive. But it could not be productive if the solar power is plentiful and the radiation would not exceed Earths levels 
595	It could be easy conditions to some humnas, but not all. 
596	The traveling on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edged of imagination and innovation. 
597	the culture in this society helps create less dependence on cars which leds to a better envrionment. 
598	Last but not least, the culture of the world is constanly changing day by day. 
599	"with its rocky terrain and with that Astronmers are fascinated. ""If our sister planet is so inhospitable, why are scientists even discussing further visits to its sureface? Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system "
600	Mona Lisa is a famous painting by Leonardo da Vinci. There is many theories of Mona Lisa being sad, or feeling many other emontion but no body knows the truth but Da Vinci.  
601	"Based on the text evidence,  "" Making Mona Liza Smile,""  a new software called Facial Action Coding System has been developed to try infenitfing Mona Lisa's facial expressions. She could have up to six different basic emontions.  First of all, Mona Lisa overall expressions use she is 83% happy.  Based on this article, "" the software can even identify mixed emotions (as in da Vinci's masterpiece). each expression is compared against neutral face (showing no emotion)."" This is saying that even that she shows no expressions, she is certainly happy but might be having mix feelings as well.  Another reason Mona Lisa can be feeling disgusted, fearful, or even angry but yet she's very mysterious. In the text it says, "" most of us would have trouble actually describing each facial trait that conveys happy, worried, etc."" "
602	If humans have trouble figuring out if something is feeling happy or sad, how can a software be able to do such thing.  
603	"The software FACS is interesting becuase it's able to know your emotions with any movement you do. For example, in the text it says, "" even though individuals often show varying degress of expressions. Using a video imagery, the new emotion-recognition software tracks thsee facial movements."" If a gental move can determine an emotion, this software will have a challenge on finding out Mona Lisa's emotions because it's just a painting.  Therefore, Mona Lisa will be mysterious until the software identifies her emotions. Mona Lisa is and will always be a unique peice of art. "
604	Can we calculate our emotions like math? Even we don't use this kind of techonology we can tell other people emotions by looking at their face. If we known all about what other people think about us, it didn't good for all of us.  
605	If we are happy, surprice, angry, disgust, fear and sad other people can seen by looking at our face. But some people can control their felling so sometime it hard to know their expression. Sometime it is good to know how people think about us but sometime not knowing what other pwople thik about us better. Some people can't tell other people emotion by looking at their face. Most human communication doesn't have emotion. They talked to each other because they think they have to.  Some people can know that the difference between a real smile and the forced smile. In real smile your muscles that begin at your cheek bones lift the coners of your mouth. In forced simle your muscles that begin at your cheek bones stretched sideways. If you are surprice you raises your eyebrows and if you are angry you tightens your lips 
606	The author suggest that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit 
607	"despite Exploring Venus the Evening star,"" is the one of the brightest point of light in night sky, making it simple for even an amature stargazer to spot. Venu is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size, and occasinally the closet in distance too. they said the venus was the Earth twin it becasue Venus ans the earth was the closet planet in the hole planet on the space, and that why it the brightest point in the night sky; "
608	this is why it's not worthy pursuit despite the danger it present 
609	"On Page 2. it said "" No spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours. Maybe this issue explanin why not a single sapceship has touches down on venus in more than decades. Numerous factors cintribute to Venus's reputation as challenge planet for human to study, despite its proximity to us"". "
610	"Exploring Venus was despite the danger because On page 3. said "" Even more challenging are the cloud of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere"". "
611	that why Venus is whorthy pursuit despite the dangers presents. 
612	"In Vauban, GermanyÂ  70 percent of their families do not own cars, and 57 percent saold a car to live here. people find it better to walk to places rather than having to use a vehicle. ""All of our development since World War II has been centered on the car, and that will have to change,"" said David Goldberg, an official of Transportation America. The Environmental Protecton Agency is promothing ""car reduced"" communties. Delivery companies complained of lost revenus, while exceptions were made for plug-in cars. it was the third straight year cars have been banned with only buses and taxis permitted for the Day Without Cars in this capital city of 7 million. ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,"" said businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza as he rode a two-seat bicycle with his wife. Two other Columbian cities, Cali and Valledupar, joined the event. The day without cars is part of an improvement campaign that began in Bogota in the mid-1990s. In parks and sports centers their pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth, sidewalks. With all these changes, poeple who stopped car commuting as a result of the recession may find less reason to resume the habit. New York's new bike-sharing program and its skyricketing bridge and tunnel tolls reflect those new priorities. A study last year found that driving by young people decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009. Bill Ford, executive chairman of the Ford Motor Company, proposed partnering with the telecommunities industry to create cities in which ""pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources lower emissions and improve safety.""

613	It says that when Luke had to feed the animal he had to go when it was raining also and that he had to walk on a slippery ladder. Next he rode a cattle to Greece because he said it was a life time if he went. Then,the catlle boat trips were unbeliveable opportunity for a small town boy. Also,his second job was to take care of the animals every hour. For instance he couldnt work because his ribs wre crack. Then he rode to different countries. Its says Luke always found time to have fun on board,especially on return trips after the animals had been unloaded. Then it says,but being a Seagoing Cowboy was much more than a adventure for Luke it opend the world to him. Its also explains he has to take care of horses cows and mules that were shipped overseas. Next it helps countries recover their food supplies,animals and more 44 nations joined together to form UNRRA.For instance he knew it was an opportunity of life time. Luke and don signed up for it. don invited him to Europe and they had to ride a cattle. They also went to New Orleans for orders. He said it prepared him for work because he had things to take care of something. He said it opened the world to him. Then he said he went to different countries all over the world he got different jobs also. Thats how he convine others. 
614	Nearly over 78% of students participate in after school or extracurricular activities in the US as of today. 
615	In the articleit saysÂ´Venus is the closest planet to earth in terms of density and size and occasionaly the closest in distance toÂ´.This is saying that venus is closer to us and we have more adantage of knowing more about it because more people can go on it since it is closer. 
616	It also says that Â´Numerous factors contribute to venus reputation as a challenging planet for humans to study despite its proximity to us. which also means 
617	that it could also be difficult to pursuit worthy on venus because it could be difficult to study. 
618	When assigned a project during summer break, don't you wish you could have control? 
619	Thia means that da Vinci helped people to paint different look of emotion and feeling on the paint that they had made. The new software store simlar to rate the informations. 
620	To bring smile to your fae, while it's show just how much this computer can do. This mean the image on computer can make you happy,sad,smile and anger. It appers on your screen a similar ad might follow. 
621	This explain how people can know how new software works. The software rate your feeling which can bring change in the real life from children and alduts. In fact these instructions for face that looks happy. It's all bout those muscular action. That can indicate the different between a genuine smile and force one. 
622	By looking at A computer it can indicate what your truely felling. When someone doesnt have A facial expression on thier face the Facial Action Coding System can identify what they are truely felling. 
623	Making A facial expression everyday can help you produce the expression more often. 
624	Most the time whatever emotion your felling the more this emotion will pop up in your life time. Most emotions can be detected based on your facial expression or the way you move or speak. If your around someone who is always smiling chances are you will be happy to. Based on someones else emotion you can sometimes fell the pearsons happiness, sadness, or anger torwds themself, or someone else. 
625	NASA is working on a lot of different approaches on how to last a while or have a good landing on Venus. 
626	Eveyone should have one of these or get an computer lie this one. If you really need to know about smeone you just would look on it to see what it is. 
627	This would be good when a school have a play and the people that are watching them need or want to figure out how the characters feel. 
628	Just remember, just because your forced to stop using a car doesnt mean you should give up and quit, just see it as a change in your life and a relief you are helping to make on earth.    
629	With all that being said, why would we want to go back there. 
630	I love the idea of going back to Venus and exploring because we are humans and we have an unlimited imagination. 
631	They say the facial expressions for each emotion are universal because even though individuals often show varying degrees of expression, the new emotion are facial movements for example the painted face from the Mona Lisa, we can identify a lot emotions as Vinci's masterpiece. Each expression is a neutral face. Of course, most of us would have trouble actually describing each facial trait that conveys happy,worried,sad,etc. 
632	most human comunication is nonverbal, including emotionalcomunication, so that mean the computers have to understand that too, sometimes not only moving your facial muscles make make you express your emotion but that maybe make you feel them,making that can reveal sabout the science of the emotions. 
633	I was 18 before arriving in Greece,but I was heading to Greece with 335 horses, and loads of hay and oats to feed the horses with 
634	Venus may have some dangers 
635	Here are some things you should know about Venus 
636	"Venus may be called "" Evening Star "". The Evening star is one of the brightest point of light in the sky. Even though Venus is called a Star it's actually a planet. Venus is the secound planet from the sun.  It being close to the sun makes it hard to examine closely. "
637	I am going to tell you the reasons Luke joined the program 
638	nobody lives on Mars it's just a empty planet. They NASA says that the face on Mars had became a pop icon but i don't think that just because NASA has images that it's ture. You can't always believe people. 
639	Although few scientists believed the Face wan an alien artifact, Some People think the Face is bona fide evidenve og life on Mars. Evidence that NASA would rathr hide, lets say conspiracy theorists. The caption noted that the rock formation resembles a human head, formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and a mouth. This would be a good way to engage the public and attract attention to Mars. 
640	I think that the researchers shouldn't be having to look seversl times just to prove certain people wrong. If they don't believe then they need to go to Mars for themselves. It'd great that they got the comparsion but they went through trouble to get there. It was not an easy target. In face, it's hard work. 
641	 There are consequences to driving with a person on his or her phone but in some states they should not even if there should be. 
642	The program would be alsome to look at old pitures to see if they were happy or what not 
643	the program makes a 3-D face that has all 44 major muscles in the model . It has to move like a human face dose. 
644	"The program could read diffent shown emotions in the program. In fact us human perform the same impresive caculation every day.  The ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" was neat to see what the program had to say. The Facial Action Coding System read the Mona Lisa painting and it said she was 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted,6 percent fearful,and 2 percent angry. "
645	In my opinion I believe technology can't read your emotion 
646	Lastly, in the story the author talks about how they can also use the new technology they made to know the emotion of drawings like Mona Lisa. 
647	"Did you know that passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of green house gasÂ  emission in europe and up to 50 percent in some intensive areas in the united states .there were 5,500 residents within a rectangular square mile in the unitedstates,the enviormentÂ  protectionÂ  agency is promiting ""car reduce"".  communities and legislators are starting to act if cauiously in previous years80 percent of approiations have by law gone to high ways and only 20 percent to other transport. "
648	many thing consists of having a caer if you dont have a car you can hardly get around 
649	many people have cars for many reasons they have cars to get them around ,to and from work, and alot of other reasons .without a car many things will be very hard to accomplish. alot of things come with having a car you have to make sure its running right ,make sure all the tires are good , fix it if it need fixing ,and tend to it when it needs to be fix. cars come from many places all over the world thers car part that come from all over the world you just got t know your carb and when there is a problem! in this enviorment some people say cars are bad because of the gas that be in the air and that gas is expensive but without a car nothing is possible well i wouldnt say possible but it would be very hard to get around .now a days you need a car just to go around the coner and back!  
650	Launching space crafts to other planets is very expensive and even more so for a planet light year away, but if we can send space crafts to Venus when it is closest to us then it will Americans hundreds in tax dollars and we will learn a great deal from Venus. 
651	this would system would detect if the student is really ready or not. 
652	 What will it take for this tool to make it worldwide? It will half to have many great response 
653	This tool should be used many other places than schools. 
654	The outcome of this system is wonderful. I done used this system over a millions times at school. It has actually worked great at othere school to. 
655	Venus would need to get uo close and personal despite the risk and maybe should think of them as challenges. 
656	Next,lets say that maybe the human being is correct,how could scientists prove that it is what the human being suspects? 
657	"There are no certain clues or evidence that this ""face"" could be a human or an ancient Egyptian Pharoh. Sometimes the human being wants to suspect things that are not close or correct to what a specialized scientist can do. Sometimes it is just probably that the human brain gets carried away by what it looks at. Sometimes it helps to pay close attention to what we are doing or looking at, for the hiumans good. "
658	But like I had said it can be very helpful or very harmful in ways. 
659	aybe it could turn into a robot and take over the world. 
660	but if they did come out with the facial action coding system it would be kinda cool 
661	I really wish we had this type of technologhy in our generation today. 
662	Venus, Venus is known as Earths twin because of having similarity's. NASA hasn't yet found a way to have a rocketship to last on the palnet, so let alone a person could last up there. The longest a rocket has lasted on the planet was three weeks. NASA is still working on a way to send a rocket and people onto Venus wothout failing.  
663	Venus is supposed to be the Earth's twin. 
664	At the begining no space craft had survived on Venus for hours, but one of the space crafts have lasted for three weeks 
665	Venus has the hottest surface temperture of any planet in the solar system. 
666	NASA is doing hundreds of projects to get a space craft to land on Venus and to explore Venus. 
667	"The studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents because of how it said in page 2 ""the Earth, Venus, Mars, our other planetary neighbor, orbit the sun at different speeds."" "
668	"In Venus there are thing that we need because in page 3 it said "" On the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit."" "
669	Why are we trying to go to Venus? We are trying to go to Venus there are thing that need to have 
670	"In page 5 it said "" Imagine a blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the roiling Venusian landscape."" It's trying to said it that how can we go there and can we live in that plane. Solar power would be plentiful, and radiation would not exceed Earth. "
671	The closest planet to Earth in density, size, and sometimes distance also is, in fact, Venus. It was even once may have been known as the most Earth-like planet in our solar system. Venus and Earth has come similar features such as rocky sediment, valleys, mountains, and craters. However, Venus isn't all that pretty. 
672	""" It's 2016 and i still look young!"" said Luke. he was the cowboy who rode waves ""Ok dad since Forever ago!"" said his daughter. She was in town for special reasons.  "" Can you tell me a story of when you were young?"" his daughter asked. "" Oh all right,but just one. When I was young I was a wave surfer and-"" he was enturupted by his daughter. "" that part changes every time last time you told me this story it was a sailor and then it was a -"" ""Alright mabey I was just a guy on a cattle boat."" he said.  "" His daugter laughed at him, just a guy on a cattle boat,huh."" she said ""Hey it payed the bills, got food on the table,and payed the hospital bills too!"" he said angerly. His dauhter sat there with nothing to say. ""You promised to never talke about her ever again!"" not knowing what he said. she left the room with nothing to say.  She left the hous got in her car and drove off without a hug or a kiss goodbye. She never had done this before. She never knew her mother.  But of course she came back and he talked about his journeys to china and all different places. "
673	this would a huge milestone and would be amazing. one of many resons would be to use it for the study of earth and our sun. 
674	this is however a bad way to get there for the astronuts would be there for a short time becuse of fuel cost and coservaton. as well as there would be no real way to test the surfuse of venus from there ass you could not get to the surfuce. 
675	this would give use amazing resalts. but a the cost of developing a computer that the last time these were largly used was in the 1940's wolud be a fotune and they left that out for they relly whant to go. 
676	"My claim for, ""Making Mona Lisa Smile,"" would go against what the author is trying to say. "
677	The reason is, because anybody can say that they made a Facial Action Coding System computers. 
678	If you are reading this then you would understand what I am trying to say or try to tell you. I think also if they did come put with the computer then people would like to be able to hear what the computer is capable of. If you understand then you would agree with me that the people should know what it does and what it can not do. If it can stop fight's then it should be brought to the people's attention, but if it can not stop fight's then it should not be brought to the people's attention 
679	What if you the reader are using this and it tells you that you are mad then keep it. Then on the other hand you got to realize that if it says that you are mad but you are happy, then give it back to the company that you bought the item from and get your money back. So that is why my claim is going to be against what the author is trying to say. 
680	"If a real person is reading this then you will understand what I am trying to tell you. Also if you were wise as well then you can understand what I am trying say by, ""you can never trust if the item will work or not."" "
681	So this is why my claim is what it is. 
682	I think that the new technology to read students faces in the class room could be of some use, but I also think that it would not be of use in the classroom. 
683	 I support and do not support this at ther same time. i support it because I feel it could be helpful but I do not suppot this because I feel if a child needs help with how they are feeling they will go to an adult they trust, weather it be a teacher at school or a parent or even a friend at achool.   
684	But if we go into more details i remember once i read/seen something about that there might be some alliens out there in space. The face of the earth was created by natrual landform as NASA has said. On May 24,2001 a spacecraft was circling around when they fount a shadowy figure like a human face! The thing is how will we ever know the real truth behind that. Yeah i know people tell us differnt things but how will we know witch one to belive out of all them. We obviosly have to belive NASA because they are the ones that go up there often and let us know if there is anything new up there. 
685	Its not like we can go up there anytime we want and cheke for ourselfs! The bad thing is that we will never find out for our ownselfs but thats just the way things are! 
686	"In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,""the author suggests that studying planet Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangerous it presents "
687	Scientists believe Venus was once covered largely wiht oceans and could of supported forms of life 
688	This will probably change a lot of things 
689	Because what will it be about what will they say they might hurt or say something a student does not want to hear. 
690	What will they do with the student council. I don't think this is a good idea at all because hoe are they going to go threw the whole school for whatever they have to say to every individual student. It might take a while for a lot of students or it might be quick. It's going to be hard because some people are good and don't need it. 
691	A boy named Luke Bomberger got to do all of the things that you could be able to do, by joining the Seagoing Cowboys program. 
692	Luke got to go see and meet new people during his free time while people were still unloading the animals, and probably learned new things about those peoples cultures too. 
693	If you ever are a capatin of a ship in the Seagoing Cowboys program or in any program, is that you will already know how to control a ship, keep your ship members in order, and know what to do when you are on that ship. Luke Bomberger got to learn a few things on how to contol a ship and what to do when a storm hits and you sail right through the storm. 
694	After you are finished with the program, and you need to find a job, you could open a new farm and already know how to take care of most of your animals. When Luke was on the ship he already knew how to take care of the animals but he probable go to learn new things on how to take care of them. 
695	Luke didn't paticipate in the Seagoing Cowboys because he hat to stay at home. And because he had just graduated from high school. he didn't think it was nessisary to go and he had a leave at home even tho he had a family at home. He didn't want to just leave them at home with out him. Becuase he had no one to watch them when they was at home alone with no one to talk to. He desided to stay and not go so he can be there with them and he was going to pertect them from harmes way. he loved his family to much to just leaver to join a cowboy group with people her didn't know at all so he said No and that he was staying with them. Because if he would have left it would proboly change ther life and his forever. they didn't want to stay home by there self for a long time he wanted to stay and help them out around there house and other stuff. And because it was to danges for him any way that is why he didn't want to go. And he just wanted to stay and not put himself in danger because it was a war and he didn't want to die and never return. 
696	"Venus's knickname is sometimes called the ""Evening Star"" mainly because Venus is simple to see from the distant but safe vantage point of Earth has proved a very challenging place to examine closely.  It is also called the ""Evening Star"" because Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size, and occasionally the closest in distance too. On Venus, the temperatures average over 800 degrees Farenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than on Earth. "
697	Venus has value because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself just like intimidating endeavors does as well.  Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts, it should only be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation.  This helps to strive to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value. 
698	Like in the passage it says that for an example, if you smile when a web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be different 
699	The article stated that it is one of the brightest point of light in the sky. 
700	"But hey it is 2018 anything could happen. In paragraph 5 it states ""In fact, we humans perform this same impressive ""calculation"" every day. For instance, you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face.""  DR. Huang predicts. ""Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" How could that even work. "
701	"Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of Density and size, and occasinally the closest in distance too.""  "
702	The program could lead to major scientific/artistic break throughs. 
703	"the author starts out with how and what Venus looks like. The author also compares Venus to Earth and says ""[It's] Often reffered to as Earth's ""twin.""' "
704	"To end off on a good term, the author had put in time to let people know that we should think smarter not harder to be able to see closer into what Venus is hiding. The Author says ""...Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doughts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation."" This meaning not to thing to hard and work with what you got insted of thinking of a way to get all information right away. "
705	Studying venus would be really interesting but venus is hard to study because itÂ´s dangerous and it has really high pressure.  
706	"Plan:A photo from 1998,is a pciture of a mask. So why they ""MGS"" claims is not a face? We don't,be we do know is that a high-resolution images and 3D altimetry takes picture from outer space. It says that ""NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft was circling the planet,snapping photo possible landing sites for it's sister ship"". "
707	"their is a possibitiy that maybe there is an ""Anicent civilization"" that lived on Mars that we don't know about. "
708	"""A few days later NASA unveilied the images for all to see. The caption noted a ""huge rock formation...which resembles a human head...formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes,nose,and mouth "
709	"So basically it tell the readers or the scientist thatat some point of time their was humans on ""Planet Mars"",and really they're trying to get them to realized just because its a""huge rock formation"" what if they'rereally humans skulls under all of the rocks? "
710	The 'Face on Mars' was found by us NASA, in 1976. It got very popular over the years then. 
711	The work I did on Mars made me think that we aren't the only planet with life 
712	This 'Face' isn't a landform, its a lifeform. 
713	thats what all the faces on Mars, if there is life, look like 
714	When life on Mars dies they will bury them like we do.  Also, the way this 'Face' appeared there when it was buried. It got buried there forever ago and now the skull is popping up. 
715	The leaders would put it into motion and try to find more life forms or signs of life 
716	Maybe these forms there, don't need to live with water and oxygen like we do they may just have to live off of sunlight or dirt maybe something crazy like that. NASA will one day find more evidence of lights on other planets. 
717	Studying Venus can be a good thing to do, you will learn more about the planet and why it is our sister planet to us 
718	"You will have a lot of information and reasonings on why it's that planet or why is it close to the sun. The text gives you a lot of information about venus and why it is called that. As it states ""long ago when venus was covered with nothing but the ocean"", they could of had human life on that planet. You can study venus and maybe found out if there was any human life their besides the oceans that were their. You can be the one who goes to space and can take a look at venus and if it's safe you can probably visit the planet "
719	I suggest that it is a good idea to study venus, you might have a chance to visit the planet venus. 
720	What its trying to tell us is that Venus is a planet in which in life is nothing close to ours. The planet is buring hot due to the fact it's closer to the sun. Explaining that life in Venus isn't possible human.  
721	"After reading the passage I am able to infer the main idea, which was the author supporting his idea of Venus is worthy pursuit despite the dangers. The infernace I was able to capture,""human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally imtimidating endeavors.""(para.8.) This paragraph gives us the idea of us humans. We could be told one millions times not to do somehting, but at the of the day we all end uo doing it like it or not. "
722	Imagine you were forced to work on a topic you hated 
723	The first spacecraft to see this landform was NASA's Viking 1 in 1976. Then 18 years later, on April 5, 1998, the MGS flew over Cydonia for the first time. The picture that the MOC was 10 times sharper than the orginal Viking photos. This became very popular at that time in the past. The Face was used in a Hollywood film, appeared in books, magazines, and radio talk shows. 
724	These things started all the talk about the face being created by aliens. 
725	Humans have sent numerouse spacecraft to land on venus but none have survived for more than a few hours. Every since then not a single spacecraft have touched down on venus since more than three decades. Venus have a thick atmosphere of almost ninety-seven percent carbon dioxide. Venus temperatures is really extreme the temperature average eight hundred degrees on a regular. The pressure and atmosphere is ninety times greater then earth's atmosphere. 
726	The only problem with everything thats going is that being above and studing the planet give you limited insight on the ground to see whats going on. More importantly researchers cannot researchsample of rock, gas or anything else from that distance in the air. NASA is making electronic 
727	"in VAUBAN,Germany executives are making a big leap on forbidden street parking,driveways and home garages. it costs $40,000 to buy a parking space becuse of the retricans on cars. The reason for this ""smart planning"" is becuse 12 percent of green house gases in Europe come from tailpipes. David Goldberg qoutes that ""All of our development since World War II has been centered on the car and that will have to stop"". In the United States the Environmental Protection  Agency is promting car reduction becuse of pollution being at such a high polution rate. paris has the most smog out of any other European capital.  BOGOTA,Colombia had a car free day and millions of colombians hiked,biked,skated or took buses. rain did not stop people from pertisipating in this event,for the first time two other colombian cities,cali and valledupar joined this event.  president Obama ambitous goals were to curb the united states greenhouse gas emissions unveiled last week. more americans are buying more and more less cars. Mr. sivaks son lives in san fransisco and has a car but takss bay area if nessecary. "
728	In 1945 we went to New Orleans to get started with our program on the SS Charles W. Wooster. I turned 18 when we finally made it to Greece wich meant that I could be drafted for military servrice. By the time I was discharged in 1947 I had made nine trips,the most of any Seagoing Cowboy. It took about two weeks to cross the Atlantic Ocean from the eastern coast of the United States and a month to get to China 
729	On my second trip I served as night watchman. My job was to check on all the animals every hour every night. One rainy night after making my hourly report to the captain I slid down a slippery ladder on my backside. My heart raced as I shot feet first toward an opening on the side of the ship. A small strip of metal aalong the edge stopped my slide keeping me from flying overboard into the dark Antlantic. 
730	There is a new software the has been developed that improves accuracy in perceiving the emotions of other. The Facial Action Coding System. They put a imagine of Mona Lisa Smile. In the applications called FACS knows how she is like how happy you are or angry. But with her they got a 83 percent happy, 9 percent disguested, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry. In the software is the latest innovation from prof. There is Thomas Huang, of the beckman institute for Advanced Science at the University of illinois, working in collaboration with prof. Also they actually calculate emotions like math homework and how a computer recognize the subtle facial movements we humans use to express , and how we feel. The computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the faces. And the facil expressions for each emotion are universal, observes Dr. Huang. Even though individuals often show varying degrees of expression like not smiling as broadly. With Mona Lisa demonstration is really intended to bring a smile to your face, while it shows just how much the computer can do. They are 3 things while you are looking in the mirror 1 is raise your lips at the comers of your mouth, 2 is squinting yours eyes slightly, to produce wrinkling at the comers of your eyes and 3 is holding that raise the outer parts of your cheeks up. Towars your eyes. The facial feedback theory of emotion, moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions, but also may even help produce them. Empathy feeling someone else's emotional state may happen because we unconsciously imitate another person's facial expressions. All that is about science or technology. 
731	I think the application is smart because it show's you how you are in the moment. 
732	"because only they can stay there for a couple of hours before they can't be out on venus anymore however they do have a nickname for Venus it is called the ""Evening Star"" and why they named it that because it is one of the brightest point of light in the night sky but they said that nickname was misleading because Venus was a actual planet in our solar sytem and Venus was simple to see from a distance but it is a safe vantage point from it said that it was proven a very challenging palce to examine more closely but they often reffered Venus as earths twin because Venus is the closest planet to earth in terms of density and size and it is occasionally the closest in distance too. But striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself , but also because human curiosity it will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors. And our travels on earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation. But the reason why Venus is not good to explore because almost 97% of carbon dioxide blankets is covered all over Venus and on the planets surface it is about 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet. "
733	Having 4 mirrors in total is the reason for a car, without mirrors you will be driving and have nothing to look forward to and also backwards. 
734	Explaining all this to the police is a big mess when the situation can be resolved by just focusing on the road and what's in front of you. 
735	Making technology that can identify human emotions would be important, but not very much in everyday use 
736	This device would also be helpful there because it tells you about the muscles that move to show a certain emotion. 'For example, your frontalis pars lateralis muscle (above your eyes) raises your eyebrows when surprised...' (D'Alto paragraph 3); students can study their muscles that make their emotions by learning about these muscles.  
737	Just by making faces and using this technology, students can learn so so much more about their emotions on a deep level that can help in many ways. It would benefit students, teachers, therapists, and more. 
738	In the first paragraph, the first sentence kind of threw me off a little bit, because when you say it like the paragraph did then it makes it sound bad knowing other people emotions. 
739	It can be an astriod hiting the earth or it could very well be a mountain like we have on earth. Another thing i think it could be is an un earupted valcanneo like an other thing we have on earth. Also it can be where the inside of the planit has bin pushed out to cause a natural land form. There can also be other things it can be 
740	The people that think that it is an alien civilisation they have to back there rason up with a lot of information and very detaild information to get me on there side. Even then I probibly wont believe them it would have to be a very low chance i would take there side. 
741	"In the article it states""The Face on Mars is located at 41 degrees north martian latitude where it was winter in April '98-a cloudy time of year on the Red Planet."" A lot of people believe it is a natural landform but some people think it was put there. Some people think there is life on Mars. Do you think this face is a natural landform or a sign of life on Mars? "
742	To you this might not be interesting but you will read about it everywhere. 
743	"In the article it states""The 'face on Mars' has since become a pop icon."" The news is everywhere in places you might not expect! I think the scientists are excited about what they found. Did you enjoy hearing all the news about the Face on Mars? "
744	Were you ever reading a book or watching a film and you came across this? 
745	"The article states"" It has starred in a Hollywood film, appeared in books, magazines, radio talk shows-even haunted grocery store checkout lines for 25 years!"" People could just simply sit down to read a magazine and fined this amazing news. Someone could jump in the car just to hear the news that could make your mind race wondering how they found out the news. I wonder how many people were amazed by this news! "
746	I think this face is a natural landform. 
747	If a human gets hurt then the emotion and the expression would be squinting there eyes being loud or holding whatever got hurt. 
748	So giving those types of animations and expressions to robots and video game characters would be good because you would not be able to tell what happened to them if they didnt have any emotion of when they got hurt or smiling. When a human is taing a picture and you want to make it look nice they would smile so they would open there mouth and show there teeth making there face wrinkle. They need to put the same emotion and such for animated characters in tv shows and video games. Also you have to use some muscles to smile and to show facial expressions towards everything like jobs,school,and even taking pictures. 
749	I will be taking about the Unmasking the Face on  Mars 
750	I believe that the aliens did not find the face on mars. I say people found it on mars.  
751	Mars is now Famous for the face.  The face was on mars. The face was a pop Icon. The evidence I have that it says that it was in Movies books Haunted grocery store. Thatfor I know it is a pop Icon. To Mars because nothing ever has been found on Mars because it is super hot to do anything on it and ut is made out of sand. So that for I know the face was there before the aliens found it. The Face was on mars because the title of the article is Unmasking the Face on Mars. If you read the Article you would now that. The face is important to Mars and to the scientist Becaus e this is the fist thing found on Mars. The Face will Stay on Mars as long as it does not get damaged some how or disform 
752	I conclued that the face will be there forever and ever. The Aliens did not fine the face. I am so mad that the you think that the aliens found the face but they did not The scientist found it so think again because if the Aliens did found out that they did find it then we should say sorry to the Aliens for thinking that we found it. I say That we should discuss with our own sicentist to find out who found the face on mars. 
753	Informing fellow citizens about the advantages of limiting car usage. 
754	"This article is at the ""The challenge of Exploring  Venus."" "
755	"""Evening Star"" this article state in, venus is one of the brightest points of light in the night sky,making it simple for even an amateur stargazer to spot.  ""Twin"" this article state in, venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size, and occasionally the closest in distance too.  ""The venus blanked."" The article state in the venus atmospere have almost of 97 percent of carbon dioxide.  ""Venus surface."" the article state on the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greateer than what we experience on our own planet.  The article essay, thia articlo explain about ""The challenge of Exploring Venus""  venus is a planet nd look like a star because brightes points of light in the nigth sky, and tambien is a ""twin"" is the earth's twin, venus is it really closest at the eart and tambien look similar in the size and in the density, tambien look are similsr in the distance.         "
756	the author want to show you all the data he picked up good and bad. 
757	"venus is looked at and called the ""evening star"" for being very bright but it can also be refered to the ""twin"" for having simaller charchaterists like in terms of density and size. on the other hand venus goes a very differnet speed then the other planets. leaving the abillity to go venture very dangerous. venus can have an atmosphere of 97 percent carbon dioxide which can be very harmful to humans along with the fact that it is 800 degrees Fahrenheit.  "
758	The recent technology on seeing emotions talks about how the Mona Lisa is 83 percent happy, 9 percent disguested, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry. How can we know if this is true because we were not there to tell what her emotions where. Yes you can see some emotion in her painting, because it states that Da Vinci studied the human anatomy so that it would help him with painting facial muslces precisely to show emotion. 
759	The author does very well arguing his or her point. 
760	No spacecraft has ever had any human pilots on it due to the fact that the spacefrafts never last very long once they land of the planet. The planet's stmosphere is made up of 97% of carbon dioxide and corrosive sulfuric acid. The temperature of the planet of on average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit and the atomspheric pressure is almost 90 times greater than our own. 
761	The temperature would still be about 170 degrees Fahrenheit, but the air pressure would be close to that of sea level on earth. 
762	"Then, this software technology has a constructs a 3-D computer model of the face. All 44 majors muscles in the model must move like human muscles. Movement of one or more muscles is called an ""action unit"". Then Dr. Hunag relies on the work of psychologists, such as Dr. Paul Eckman, creator of FACS ( Facial Action Coding System. Using video imagery, the new emotion-recognition software tracks these facial movements in a real face or in the painted face of Mona Lisa. By weighting the different units, the software can even identify mixed emotions ( as in da Vinci's masterpiece). Each expression is compared against a neutral face (showing no emotion). The new computer software stores similar anatomical information as electric code. This technology can read people's emotions by raising your lips at the corners of your mouth. Then squirt your eyes slightly, to produce wrinkiling. Holding that, raise the outer parts of your cheeks up, toward your eyes. "
763	Sometimes on the news there is either an accident or a suicide. It might involve someone not looking where they're going or tweet that someone sent. It either injury or death. If a mysterious number says I'm going to kill you and they know where you live but you don't know the person's contact ,It makes you puzzled and make you start to freak out. Which can end up really badly. 
764	Let me tell you the things that would change of limiting car usage. 
765	you dont have to worry about them running out of food because we always carry enuff to venture the far and cool places we go to. 
766	china and i got to see the Panama Canal,all and all it's just a realy good experience and you would like it if you are an outgoing person. 
767	who doesn't love that and it just gives you time to explore and have fun with everything the animals the ocean the adventure and the quitness of just hereing the waves and having a great time. 
768	And that is why i think you should come aboard with us because all and all you would just have a great time. 
769	but I still think it is a bad idea. 
770	You get free breakfeast every morning. There will be eggs,panacakes,bacon,sausage and more. If you join this month you will get a free trip to the next place we go. On the boat there is a pool,and there is a hot tub. The pool and hot tub closes at 10:00. 
771	Since the planet is very identical to earth, we are all going to want to explore it. Exploring and studying Venus comes at a cost though, it is a worthy pursuit despite the presentation of it's dangers. 
772	trying to examine Venus more closely then of the safe vantage point of Earth, can be very challenging despite it being simple to see from the distance. 
773	We are all closer to Mars than Venus sometimes due to the speed changes at which they orbit the Sun by. Us humans send a variety of spacecrafts to the cloud-draped world for it to land on. No spacecraft has survived the landing for a couple hours. This means that all the previous missions to mars were all unmanned. 
774	All of these failed missions have explained why Venus hasnt been touched in more than three decades by a single spaceship. 
775	Many scientist are trying to explore this planet despite its inhospital conditions because it is very identical to Earth. 
776	Summer break, the time for pool parties and vacation for students: to get away from school. Therefore, why should they be forced to do some teacher choice project that they will most likely dread 
777	"A 3-D computer is a model of the face all 44 muscles and its called an ""action unit"". The Dr. Huang relies to work on of psycholoists and Dr. Paul Eckam, the creater of FACS (Facial Action Coding System). Dr. Eckman classified six basic emotions suprise, anger, happiness, fear, and sadness. Then he made associated each with charatcteristic movements of the facical muscles.  Dr. Huang smiling broadly "" even though individuals often show varying degrees of expression"". Huang using video imagery, new emotion-recognition software tracks these movements in a real face or the painted picture of Mona Lisa. The weighting the diffeent units in the software can be even identify mixed emotions. Even each expression can be compared against the neutral face.  The humans perform the same impressive ""calualtion"" every single day. if we can probably tell our friend how they're feeling because by the way look on there faces. But most of us would have trouble describing each facial. "
778	when its summer break i love to go off and have fun with my friends and family, we always are out doing something weather it be hanging around the house or off on a trip somewhere, other students dont do this and it is honestly really cool, last summer my girlfriend and i went down to nags head with her family, i had the most fun time while we were down there, even though i accidentally left my wallet at her house. 
779	the teachers already know what to do about a teacher designed project and that i do believe is why some students dont get along with the teacher. Teachers want to help kids and kids that have troubles listening or learning, i'm not saying that teachers dont listen because you have some of them that do, but, unfortunatelyÂ teachers dont interact with students as they should 
780	I am going to show my opinion about Texting or being on the phone while driving and, I show some you'll what could happened when you decide to be on the phone while driving. An I hope when you are reading this, I hope you chance your mind about texting while driving and I should thank all my reader for taking the time up to reading this essay. 
781	Teens now of days hide their emotion's from parent's ,teachers, friends, anybody that's close to them 
782	Using video imagery to recognize the facial emotion. 
783	Humans perform the same calculations every day. 
784	In the article Luke was asked by his freind don to go to Europe on a cattle boat. Luke couldn't say no so when he said yes that would change his life. So then now he has been on nine trips since the first ever trip that he has taken. Luke was always busy tending the cattle during the day. He was having lots of fun even when he got knocked over the boat and broken his ribs. He was playing board games and everything like that to keep him busy while he was healing.  The reason of Luke going on trips across the oceans because he likes it and he was born to do it. Also his freind asked Luke to come with him to keep him company during the trips. Luke was waiting for some thing to drastically change his life and he to his wish off the drastic change. Luke would stop going with don if Luke didn't like the motion sickness,or because there where a lot of storms,or he didn't like tending the cows during the long and tiring journey. If the possibility was that Luke didn't like the sea his freind would be like are you ok and or something like that.  In conclusion Luke loves the sea and he wants to keep going out and adventuring the wild and the unknown. Luke couldn't say no because it was his freind don and he wanted to explore another island. Luke loves the same because he likes tending the cows and he likes his fellow crew mates that are with him on his journeys to the out and the open sea. Another reason that is because he wants to be in dangerous storms and worlpools. Luke want to take the risks in the dangerous sea. 
785	venus is the closet planet to earth and also has the hottest surface temperatue of any planet in our solar system . '' astronomers are fascinated by venus because it may well once have been the most earth-like planet in our solar system '' this shows that venus is a likely planet. There are numerous factors contribute to venus's reputation as a challenging planet for human to study , However NASA is working on other ways to study venus . ''Many researchers are working on innovations that would allow our machines to last long enough to contribute meaningfully to out knowledge of venus '' 
786	this shows that its alot to learn about venus 
787	".""striving to meet the meet the challenge presented by venus has vaulse , not only because of insight to be gained on the planet itself , but also because of human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors. "
788	this shows that venus is challeging despite the dangers 
789	The make of Mona Lisa smile will be tough because she had 2 percent of anger and 9 percent of disgusted. Mona Lisa is only at 83 percent happy, so she need to remove those anger and disgusted. People makes many emotions, so they can express how they feel. When people are in a fight, they showed their anger which include emotion. Eckman have many basic emtoions, and it can also associated each with characteristic movements of their facial muscles. 
790	First, people have many different emotions. 
791	Then, many characters can make a movements of facial muscles. 
792	Finally, making a communication with others will also showed your facial expressions. 
793	Making a facial movements and expression while communicating with others is important because it will tell the others how you feels. 
794	Mona Lisa don't smile often, but the computer can make her face smile by using the imagery. Facial impression and movements are not just for communicating it can also be in while looking at someone or reading a books. 
795	Do i think that using technology to read emotion expressions of students in a classroom is valable you may ask, 
796	Technology has come so good in the past 17 years. 
797	I remember back in 2000 when the flip phones had just come out and fast forwars 17 years later we now have a computer that can read anyones facial expression and tell us how they are feeling. I can't even begin to imagine how much more advanced technology is going to get later on in life, it already seems to be that we could possibly have all the technology we could ask for, yet people all around the world just seem to be getting better and thinking of smarter ways to invent new things.  
798	Yes,the use of this techology is valuable beacuse maybe what you'er are upset and there is no one there to make you feel better. 
799	"That at least according to some new computer software that can recognize emotions. The person who is making the software is Thomas Huang,of the Beckman institute for advanced science at the university of illinois""(paragraph 1) .Huang is doing this by trying to recongnize other people facial expression. This computer software is a 3-D printer which can make a mode of the face.""The process begin when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face; all 4 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles""(paragraph3).A 3-D printer is way better then a normal printer. At least for a 3-D printer it gives you all the close up details of how they are feeing.  The movement of the one is called action unit according to  Dr. huang who relies on the work of psychologist,such as Dr. Pual Eckman,creator of FACS (paragraph 3).The computer will calculate this everyday ""In fact, we human perform this same impressive ""calculation"" everyday amd for instance,you can probably tell how a friend feeling simply by the look on her face""(Paragraph5).This can calulate every single movement that you make. So here what the people who is making the software want you to do. This a partner they will like for you to take a mirror a genunie smile and forced one. The real smile is called a zygomatic major that lift the corner of your mouth.""Meanwhile,muscles called orbicularis oculi pars palpabraeus make crow's-feet around your eyes""(paragraph8).I'm pretty sure is the muscle that are around your eyes. "
800	it might just be that all the spaceship they was using or the stuff on the ship making it not able to make it all the way up there they could be making the spaceship to havey or they need to study somewhere else first just to see if the ship the reason why the cant make it there and back. i think they should try a new ship or try to make it to somewhere else before trying to make it over there try somewhere closer so than maybe you find out how to get there or mybad get close to get to there that just how i see it if you say it worthy than try a diffent plant just to see if it easy to find out how to get to that plant you been talking about that why when u pull up all the reseach you can say as i was reach i find two way to get to the plant and they gone say how u find all of that to go with that and say when u find stuff you can get stuff from it. 
801	When you want to go into a club or in sports do something that you like not something your friends like or something that can help you in life with. 
802	"The technolgy is good for seeing emotions in paintings I can see that but, my question is if we actually except it or need it at some point. What the story says has my attention but not quite everybody's. The FAC i'll Say its not valuabe because students wouldn't be really into that maybe some will but the majority will not. The object looks like something kids need in there life to learn someting new. That will motivate them for them to do great things and try to invent other things. I just writing what I know how to right this doen't really matter because imma fail anyways but this story wouldn't really valuable why because I know our generation and if we have it in our school no one would care. I wouldn't here one person say ""hey lets check out the FAC"" because I know what im saying I would like to speak the truth. The story had some interstesting facts about how could detect everything from the body (Alto, page 1). "
803	So I would say that it really isnt valuable. 
804	If I could ride the bus to and from school I would, but, they refuse to pick me up in the mornings so I drive my moms  SUV  istead while im not complaining because I dont have to ride in sticky seats or be constantly harassed by the kid behind me kicking my seat. Driving an  SUV  (which is also extremely hard to park)  is not a very efficient way to get to school 
805	The new technology is very helpful showing about whats more to a picture or a frame. 
806	for example, Mona Lisa smile to not be so serious in the picture imagine having a cute picture but your so serious. You can change that with new tecnology. 
807	Comperters are very helpful theses days in many ways. 
808	For example it can be useful for making payments , searching up information you need , paperwork, photoshop, diffrent apps that are useful on making your life better. Its a better sorce of seaching stuff up learning more about the world and the physics. Theres more to this i mostly use it for searching up information about the topic i want to learn about. Its easier for me beacuse i dont like rreading alot and i can just look up videos instead of having to sit there for an hour looking up information or reading it beacuse reading makes me sleepy. Thats why i think the web is an awsome resorse for people that need to be informed and thought many diffrent things. 
809	Many people use this method by making there photogrophy work look better than it is. 
810	Its a very good sorce for people that have the job as a photographer beacuse they will make everything work in many ways. For example if something in the picture gets in the way the computer will show u how to get rid or it instead of doing all the extra stuff on taking a whole lot of pictures that look the same or worst. Why waist your time on doing that instead get the app or the program and get to steping its way better and easier to get pictures that are perfect. 
811	the challenge of exploring venus is one of the brightest points of light in the night sky, making it simple for even an amateur stargazer to spot. however, this nickname, is misleading since venus is actually a planet. In a solar system, venus is the second planet from our sun.  they call venus like the earth twin..  Venus is the closest to Earth in terms of density and size, and occasionally the closest in distance too. Earth, venus, and mars,our other planetary neighbor, orbit the sun at different speeds. While venus is simple to see from the distant but safe ventage pointof Earth, it has proved a very challenging place to examine more closely.  MY ESSAY.  The callenge of exploring venus is one of the biggest points of light in the night sky, these differences is speed mean that sometimes we are closer to mars and others times to venus. Because venus is sometimes right aroundthe corner in space terms humans have sent numerous spacecraft to land on this cloud draped world A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent dioxide blankets venus. Also notable, venus has the hottest surface temperature af any planet in our solar system, even though mercury is closer to our sun. astronomers are fascinated by venus because it may well once have been the most Earth like planet in our solar system. long ago, venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth. Today, venus still has some features that are analogous to those on Earth. The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such ass valleys, mountains, and craters. Imagine a blimp like behicle hovering 30 or so miles above the roiling venusian landscape. However, peering at venus from a ship orbiying or hovering safely far above the planet can provide only limited insight on ground conditions bacuse most forms of light cannot penetrate the dense atmosphere, rendiring standard forms of photography and videography ineffective. A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent dioxide blankets venus. 
812	He/she explained everything about Venus, The size, were its located, how hot it is etc. I think this cause in passage 1,2,3 it gives alot of information on Venus. And the author organized the facts really well by putting alot of facts in each paragraph and focusing on that and giving alot of information on that subject. In paragraph 4 it talks about how Venus is almost like the earth and how maybe one day they would like too visit. This is a huge thing cause if so we could have another planet of life 
813	So in conclusion i think this article was very well planned and had just the right amount of infomation for a average person too learn and know about.  
814	"In paragraph 11 it states that "" As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size, so if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground, Egyptian-style pyramids, or even small shacks, you could see what they were!"" So because of what they had said in that paragraph people believed that they had saw a face. "
815	Have you ever been on a trip to cross the Alantic Ocean? A man named luke Bomberger has, and did sixteen times 
816	You can see castles and towers on your way to Europe. You may even go in them, and see the gloriuos sightings you'll ever seen in you life. This is what your going to see if you go on this program.  When your on your way to Europe, you will go through the Panama Canel. You can see what the Peoples houses look like, how they live, and what they eat. You can also see how the canael is shaped and how it was formed. That is what is going to happen when your going through the Panama Canel. 
817	You will be feeding animals and you might be hourly reporting to the captian just like Luke Bomberger! That is all the work you will be doing on this program. 
818	And that concludes the program of Seaging Cowboys. Hope you can join the program and help through our journey. 
819	This technology allows us to know how a person is feeling or allows us to know how a person was feeling when a picture was taken. 
820	Another factor to consider is not just your cell phone but anything that distracts you like food, advertisements etc, can cause an accident 
821	Although most drivers are in the age of driving, teens aren't supposed too. Teens have led to one of the reasons accidents happen. Despite the fact that they aren't supposed to be driving they are very irresponsible. On the other hand, adults are supposed to teach their kids the right way to drive, to always drive focus never look at other accidents deals in the street while driving always look ahead. However teens should drive with an adult past 7 pm. 
822	"The author say that venus is called the ""evening star"". venus is actually a planet. venus is the second sun planet from the sun. also venus is the twin of earth. venus is one of the closest planets to earth. both has the same density and size. "
823	However the conditions are not easy but its survivable for humans. Its the risk to take because venus its fastnacting to discover and see what life is up there? 
824	TheÂ  mainÂ  ideaÂ  ofÂ  theÂ  articlesÂ  isÂ  aboutÂ  theÂ  adavantagesÂ  ofÂ  limitingÂ  carÂ  usage .The writersÂ  explainÂ  howÂ  by limtingÂ  car usuageÂ  itÂ  canÂ  helpÂ  usÂ  out. 
825	Teens do sports if they want to have fun. A percentage of teens do not enjoy sports. There are even the teens that want to do sports but can't because their parents are working all the time! I am one of those teens. Most parents are busy so it is not us teens being lazy. 
826	""" Attention students, participate in at least one extracurricular activity,"" said my principal. '  ""One of these days again?"" ""I hate this school, we do this every week."" Generic_Name why do you like doing this so much?"" ""Hes letting us play sports, work on the year book, and even have free talking time."" Generic_Name said. Out of nowhere,  ""Generic_Name and Generic_Name come here!""  Me and Generic_Name looked at each otherÂ and said 'where in trouble' We went to Mr. Generic_Name Office and he asked  ""are you boys going to do any activity's?' We were shaking harder than ever. ""Yes sir ""Generic_Name said, Me and Generic_Name headed to the basketball court and there were no ball's, ""its Generic_Name"" I said, Generic_Name was very mad, ""Im done getting bullied by him!"" ""We have to confront him Cory."" ""OK lets do it"" I said.  ""Are you sure you want to do this Generic_Name?' ""Yes I will not getting bullied by him again."" We walked up to him, ""give us a ball Generic_Name"" he laughs ""play me for one."" ""OK two on one."" Generic_Name said,  ""OK nerd"" with a smile on his face. Generic_Name gets ball first, game to five  First possession Generic_Name loses the ball I pass to Generic_Name and he hits the three,""score two to zero Generic_Name"" i said. "" Yeah yeah play ball"" Generic_Name hits me for a layup, but Generic_Name was too fast we kept passing back and forth until Generic_Name got tired. A loud noise I heard before I shot, I turned around and seen Generic_Name passed out on the floor. ""Generic_Name did we go to hard?"" i asked, ""No he got what he deserved.""  Generic_Name said  We went to Mr. Generic_NameÂ office and told him what happened and  I was shocked. He is suspending us for seven days so i said, ""I dont like fun Friday Because something bad is always happening just take it out!"" ""I'm trying to do nice things for the school its better than sitting down and doing work on Frid-"" ""No its not I will rather do work!"" ""Generic_Name do you agree with me?"" ""No"" said Generic_Name ""I like doing fun FridayÂ better than doing work just like Generic_Name said,you are a nerd."" I left the office and went to the bathroom and cried. ""Its OK all of us have friendship problems"" ""Generic_Name is that you?"" ""Yes, i'mÂ sorry about all them years ago when i bullied you and Generic_Name."" i thought thats what a friendship was,"" in a sad voice. ""Can we be friends?"" he asked. ""Yeah we can"" i said with courage.  Me and Generic_Name went back to the office and I said my apologiesÂ to Mr. Generic_Name and Generic_Name."" I guess fun Friday's are not so bad after all."" 'I will unsuspend you guy's time, and keep you in school'"" said Mr. Generic_Name. "
827	I now know to agree to this idea and respect my principal choices and rules. 
828	I learned that doing activity's can bring you together with so many people its basicly changing how we act around or with others.  
829	My honest opinions on this subject matter is I think it's creative in a way but I don't like it just because of how much I have to travel everyday.Â  First I go to school of course, then I go home then I drive to practice which is a 30 minute drive, that also means driving all the way home too.Â  
830	A face on Mars is maybe when the wind blow the dust it trun that face or when they goes there they died and their dead body face is still there. But it's really interesting because that face is really big and it image 3 times bigger than th epixel size. But I believed there are not alien in the other planets or in earth because alien are not real but I have to makesure that I have to ask more question to the smartest scientist and ask about how did that face happen and how are we gonna prove about that. I have to ask more question about that too and they said that face look like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian style pyrmaids or even small shacks, you could see what they were. Some of them don't believe it because they don't see it and they just guess that answer. But when I looked at the picture I think I saw that crown and their face look shiney and in 2001 that face look destroy . I don't believe in aliens but if there was some aliens in that planet they might made that face too and they hid away from that face. I wish I see that picture for real and take some picture and prove it. 
831	"In the famous, ""Mona Lisa"" painting, many people observe her smile and think that she is being forced to smile, and that she is actually scared, frighted, or just angry. Using this computer means that we could debunk/prove this theory. This could also solve crimes, some that have not been solved to this day! "
832	The story of Making Mona Lisa Smile is about a Prof named Thomas Huang making a computer that can tell your emotions and the way you are feeling that day. 
833	"""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" Is a famous painting that includes this new technology that tells your emotion. In this famous painting she seems to be smiling in this case she really wasn't. With this technology you can see all 44 muscles. "
834	Another way that you can tell is by looking yourself in the mirror. You have muscular units that help you identify how your felling whether your happy or sad. 
835	"This famous painting is Mona Lisa in which you find her smiliing can demonstrate her emotions while they did the painting. In the article it shows that, ""shes 83% happy, 9% disgusted, 6% fearful and 2% angry."" With this Information a computer can recognize your emotions. Mona Lisa wasn't really happy but in the painting you see her with a small smile. "
836	The students these days is hard to tell because they just don't care anymore. If they don't care then there is no way to tell if they like something or not. 
837	I feel like that would take alot of work for computer technicians to actually put more devices in a computer just to see what people think about them. 
838	In this story the author is talking about how humas have not made it on the planet of Venis. At least that we know about 
839	The article said that scientits think there may be life or have been life on the planet 
840	With scientists thinking if there is something up there on the planet there is a good chance that they will be able to find out soon with all the technology we have today.  With all the things we have today I think we will find something on venus. If we do then there is a fact that there is aliens that are alive, unless they are just like us but from another planet. And that planet is closer to the sun than earth.  
841	I think with all the things in the article we will find somthing or that there was something there on venus at some point. It could of been a trillion years ago or there is still life on it today we will just have to find out. Time is the only thing that we have on are side. 
842	You will be looking forward to joining the Seagoing Cowboys, you won't even notice that the time flies by quickly. You may learn many stuff because you will be traveling to so many places, you won't even have to worry about gettiing lost because your team members will accompany you and, you'll even get supplies, if you need help they will help you they are really nice people and you don't need to have a worry. 
843	the atmosphere is almost all carbon dioxide so we would not be able to breath. Its avrage tempchure is 800 degrees fahrenheit so yeah be sure to bring your swim suit for a tan but wait theres more with the rain you will feel amazing and just melt away because all the rain is acid 
844	Yea it might have some good sides to it for crimes and all that 
845	"There are a lot of things that can back this up. In the text is say "" that you can tell how other people are feeling when they are trying to hide their emotions. The software can recognize, it was created by Dr. Huang. "
846	The cowboys played baseball,volleyball,and table-tennis and alot of other things too but Luke really loved being a Seagoing Cowboy.      
847	Venus is an interesting planet for various reasons. 
848	Students also have more time to complete the summer project since they don't have classes or work during their brake. 
849	Some students do benefit from the summer project but others don't even have the time to even complete the project at all. 
850	Summer project could be a great way for students academically but is it gonna benefit them in the long run as they choose their own path. A majority of schools in the U.S don't even have summer projects for students to do over brake. 
851	By showing they could also see if the students are happy or isgusting with their clases or even their. By saying all of this i think it is a good i dea for this facial device to be use in classrooms. 
852	First, there is no evidence of anyone going to Mars. 
853	""" Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on the JPL web site, revealing... a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all."" "
854	but the article states it could have been a person going to Mars. Scientists would have contacted the world and said we have evidence or living organisms on Mars. 
855	"I will be telling you about a story called ""A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves."" I think it is a good story. "
856	There are plenty of easy ways to prevent texting and driving. 
857	There are 3 important sources that tell us why people should limit car usage . Source 1 : In german suburb , life goes on without cars. Source 2 : Paris bans driving due to smog . Source 3 : Car - free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota. Last but not least ,Source 4 : The end of car culture . 
858	To begin with , In sources 1 & 2 you can tie in the two sources to conclude that limiting car usage is going on in Germany and Paris. Most people walk , ride bikes, or catch the train. Car ownership is allowed but there are only 2 places to put them in large garages at the edge of the development , where a car - owner buys a space for 40,000 along with a home ( 1 : In german suburb , life goes on without cars para 2 ). Paris decided to ban driving to clear the air of global cities. ( Source 2 : Paris bans driving due to smog para 10 ). Diesel was blamed , since France has a tax policy that favors diesel over gasoline .  As well in sources 3 & 4 Car - free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota and cars have come to an end with culture. They feel as though when people ride bikes , and trains it can prevent car jams. ( Source 3 : Car - free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota para 20 ).The goal was to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. In ( Source 3 : Car - free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota para 35 ). shows that for example van services can share services to have less cars and less gasoline . They also have a bike sharing company that you can share bikes and dont even need to use a vehicle. 
859	Such as, NASA could be lying to us all and making us to believe that there is no such thing as extra terestrial objects and such. Here are some interesting theories that government should give us answers on, is the world really round, do aliens exist, is NASA lying, is there really a so called space, could aliens be demons, and overall is the government lying and hiding a bunch of theories from us. In fact they may have those answers to our natural questions about life 
860	Cognitive distractors are anything that takes your mind off the road like engaging in a conversation via text or talking on the phone, or trying to operate your navigating system while route. And lastly, manual distractions which are any distractors causing you to take your hands off the wheel such as reaching for your phone to send that quick text. 
861	I support It also because it never hurts to learn new things about someone or something, but I think the thing that is stopping us is the cost that it takes to send something up there and there is no point to just send someone up there to die. 
862	What i like about this article is that it talks about a lot of things Venus has in common with earth and a lot of thing Earth and Venus have thats different then each other. 
863	But some differences are is Earth is ble top have life on it and Venus is not because the heat, pressure, and the chemicals in the air. 
864	Knowing your faults is one thing, but acting upon them is important. Many students, when given a choice in their work, will choose not to work hard or procrastinate upon them. I can attest to this myself, as I set many self projects for myself that I do not complete. Students who are hard working and care about their grade will complete their goals. 
865	Honestly helping someone would feel great. 
866	It seems that it can beused to look at the muscles of the human face. they can be used to represent emotions such as fear,sadness hapyness,disgust and even anger. to me it all make sense becuase back then schools didnt use many laptopsao back then it wouldve been useless. 
867	this famous new kind of technology has been used on a old painting the mona lisa. she is a famous painting that has a grand total of 83%happyfe 9%disguted. and 2% angry in lifethis technology csn be useful yo us 
868	Why should we limit our uses on car usages 
869	Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning. Should these projects be teacher-designed or student-designed? 
870	How would the students enjoy their summer and knowing that they got projects that is due before school starts again 
871	If we call it summer break then the students shouldn't get any summer projects thats gonna ruin the break for them. Let them enjoy their summer break 
872	It is necessary for a student to keep their mind active over long breaks from school, such as summer break.  Some may say that assigning a teacher designed project is the way to go 
873	First, cell phones are a benefit and allows everyone to have access to a telephone at all times of the day.  
874	"because in paragraph 2 it says "" how can a computer recognize the subtle facial movements we humans use to express how we feel "
875	Why would we let a computer decide the way we feel when we already know how we feel 
876	"The Mona Lisa was made to not show any emotions so why add emotions to the picture . Also in paragraph one its says "" Dr. Huang and his colleague are experts at developing better ways for humans and computers to comminicate "" "
877	Why they invent Facial Action Coding System? 
878	Mona Lisa: 83% happy, 9% disgusted , 6% fearful, and 3% angry! When Mona Lisa was painted in 1503 we had no clue how she was really feeling. But with the FACS it is now easy to see how she was feeling. That is a good thing because it could help us in the future with life or death situations. 
879	We know that Venus is a planet and that Venus is closest to Earth but some poeple might not know how danger Venus has. Has any people or a ship landed on Venus or expernece how Venus feels or looks like on ground. Is it is real worth going to Venus and expercence there conditions or find any life forms in Venus? 
880	"Luke has a lot of things to do because it says, He was working two part jobs in a grocery store and a bank his friend Don Reist invited him to go ona Europe on a cattle boat. So you can tell they go on alot of adventures all the time because in the text it says, ""It took about two weeks to cross the Atlantic ocean from the eastern coast of the United States annd a month to get to China"". Luke and Don are always prepared to go to places because it says, ""Katie's farm a boy came to Luke to prepare him for the for hrd work not the dangers at sea and his job was to watch the animals every hour "
881	The captain he slid down a slippery ladder on his backside Luke's heart bursted like 300mph. As he vrrrrooommmeeeddd a opening on the side of the ship a long strip of metal stopped his slide from falling into a dark Atlantic. 
882	Luke said that the day in pacific war ended they got there seaman's paper's and boarded the SS Charles W. Wooster headed for greece. 
883	the author supports his ideas very well 
884	The author also says Â¨venuse is the closest planet to earth in terms of density and sizeÂ¨.They have aslo sent numerous spacecrafts and have done previouse missions. The pervious missions was unmanned. There has not been a spaceship that has touched venuse and why, the author said that gthe reason that spaceship or has not landed was becuse it would not last mor than just a few hours. 
885	The author supports the idea that studying venus is worthy pursuit despit the dangers, because know that i read the story icould see why. 
886	Venus might be dangers to go to and explore but by making spacecrafts and more andmakeing experiment it probably would not be so dangerous to send spacecraft or maybe a spaceshit to try it out again. 
887	These challenges are the main thing holding us back from exploring further. The author believes that our travels beyond Earth should'nt be limited by dangers and doubts. 
888	The author gives us a new idea for better technology. The author uses a problem and solution to support the idea. 
889	Do you know how landforms are made 
890	One reason I think the face is a landform, is because the sand on that planet builds up and increases into a mountain. 
891	Also, whos to say that aliens are real or not? It wouldnt matter because even if people said aliens are real, they would need to have evidence explaining why and how aliens accually exist 
892	In the text it states that  At least according to some new computer software that can recognize emotions. The software is the latest innovation from prof. THOMAS HUANG, of the beckman institute for advanced science at the university of Illinois, working in collaboration with prof. NICU SEBE of the university of amsterdam. Dr. HUANG and his colleague are experts at developing better ways for humans and computers to communicate. The MONA LISA demonstration is really intended to bring a smile to your face, while it showa just how much this computer can do. Imagne a computer that knows when you're happy or sad. For example if you smile when a web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be different. a classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored.     
893	I claim this technology 
894	Having this new technology would be a better fit with the people because when is feeling down and the other person don't know on how they feel they always use the facial technology to show the percentages of how down they really are. 
895	But for some people they don't need that because we can tell others people facial expressions by just looking at them clearly, which it true. 
896	We already know that if someone is feeling happy,sad,angry,or fear. 
897	The only way that this could be an alien artifact is if the martians are inside of it or underneath it. 
898	That would explain how the camera can not see any other buildings around the object because they are all inside of it so no one is outside. They also could be inside of the butte because the planet is deadly for some paticular reason and they have shelter inside safely away. And another reason is because inside of the planet there may be some source of running water that is keeping them alive.  Although this could not work because they more than likely would have gotten a picture of a martian outside doing something. And they would need some source of water which has already dried up on the outside of the planet 
899	Today I'm writing about The Challenge of Exploring Venus. 
900	"Venus is sometimes called the ""Evening Star"". Its one of the brightest points of light in the sky, making it simple for even an amateur stargazer to spot. In our solar system, Venus is the second planet from the sun. While Venus is simple to see from the distant but safe vantage point of earth, it has proved a very challenging place to examine more closely.  First, there's a thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus. On the planets surface temperatures average over 800 degress Fahrenheit, and the atomospheric pressure is 90 times greater that what we expreinced on our own planet. These conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth; such an enviroment would crush even a submarine accustomed to diving to the deepest parts of our oceans and would liqefy many metals. Also notable, Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system, even though Mercury is closer to our sun. Beyond high pressure and heat, Venusian geology and weather presnt additional impediments like erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning strikes to probes seeking to land on its surface.  However, peering at venus from a ship orbiting or hovering safely far above the planet can provide only limited insight on ground conditions because most forms of light cannot penetrate the dense atomosphere, rendering standard forms of photography and videography ineffective. More importantly, researchers cannot take samples of rock, gas, or anything else, from a distance. Therefore, scientists seeking to conduct a thorough mission to understand Venus would need to get up close and personal despite the risks. Or maybe we should think of them as challenges. Many researchers are working on innovations that would allow our machines to last long enough to contribute meaningfully to out knowledge of Venus.  Last, NASA is working on other approches to studying Venus. For example, some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface and have lasted for three weeks in such conditions. Another project is looking back to an technology called mechanical computers. These devices were first envisioned in the 1800s and played an important rolein the 1940s during World War 2. The thought of computers existing in those days may sound shocking, but these devices make calculations by using gears and levers and do not require electronics at all. Just imagine exposing a cell phone or tablet to acid or heat capable of melting tin. By comparison, systems that use mechanical parts can be made more resistant to pressure, heat, and other forces. "
901	Finally, I'm talking about all the things i talked about in my paragraphs. I talked about Venus and it's nickname, the amosphere percent, orbiting and hovering and then the NASA. 
902	I think we shoud do whatever we think is right.    
903	Venus is often reffered to as Earth's twin because it is the closest planet to be like Earth in terms of density and size, and occasionally the closest in distance too. Venus would be hard to expore becuase of the planet's suface reaching up to 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmosphere pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet. Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet of solar system and if we tried to land a rover there the metal would just liquify because of the extreme temperature's. NASA however, still wants to try to study the planet but they would have to hover over Venus because of the extreme conditions on the planet's surface. Even at 30 plus miles in the air in Venus the temperatures can reach up to 170 degrees Fahrenheit. However, peering at Venus from a ship orbiting or hovering safely far above the planet can provide only limited insight on ground conditions because most forms of light cannot penetrate the dense atmosphere. Rendering standard of photography and videography ineffective. The solar power would be plentiful, and radiation would not exceed Earth's level.  More importantly, reasearchers cannot take samples of rock, gas,or anything else, from a distance. Threfore, scientists seeking to conduct a thorough mission to understand Venus would need to get up close and personal despite the risks. Many reasearchers are working on innovations that would allow the machines to last long enough to contribute meaningfully to our knowledge of Venus. 
904	For example Leonardo da Vinci used this type of calculation and knew exactly how her face needed to look in order to get the emotions he was looking for. 
905	Cars good or bad. 
906	Some citys and some subrbs say yes 
907	In France or in Vauban a suburban area in germany. such as in Paris frances the somg became to thike so for a few days they made moterd vehicles illegile and with doing that the somg cleard up pulotion went down and paris beasy streets wear feild with the silent sounds of bikes, scate boards and scaters. In Vauban a suburban area in Germany the streets are feild with kids and bikes and scaters of plenty in this suburban area moter vehicles of all kinds are illegle and the only place to park are in socure parking grages on out scurst of the suburbes. And in bogota Colombia there is car free day which is a program to get people to get out and injoy the freash air and it hopfully going to spreed to other country. 
908	So will cars become a thing of the past or will they just go green lets see what the future brings ous.    
909	but what are they trying to collect, find, or explore.  
910	In the article Â¨Making Mona Lisa Smile,Â¨ the author tells us that with technology that we have today they can see her have a full smile. The way she looks tell people that she not to comforable about something. With the special work of Computers they can change they ways she feels and look. 
911	Using those to associated every characteristic of the facial muscles and using them on Mona Lisa. With new software it can recongize Mona Lisa emotions. Which can actually calculate emotions of others. 
912	If we leave this problem as it is, every people will die because Earth is warming up year to year and we are on the crisis. 
913	We need to think about it. If we could live in Venus, it must be same as Earth, because there is the enviroment like this that we live. We alive. We have ocean for water, sun light, plants, oxygen, houses, foods, or something. We have to think about these problem, too. 
914	That Venus is the closest plant to earth,almost has the same density and size to earth but is the second planet away from the sun. It can go up to 800 degress fahrenheit on a average scale has 90 times more atmospheric pressure than earth can crush a submarine that is bulit to wistand the water pressure deep below. Venus is more hotter than mercury which is the closest plant to the sun has erupting volcanoes,powerful earthquakes,and frequent lightning dispiet the harsh elements and lack of life support. Has some similary features to earth like valleys,mountains,and craters. NASA is planing to send humans to Venus to study it's natural elements to see if it's suitable for humans.  NASA is still planing on making a trip to Venus but it will be a diffuclt change to acivemen do to it's harsh climate. Their plan is to sent scientists to float above the landscape. But the ship orbiting above the planet can only provide limited sight on the ground because most light couldn't go through the dense of the atmosphere. They could not take any miterals from Venus they have to get up close and personal to the ground dispiet the harsh cilmate. Solar power would be plentiful and radiation would not exceed Earth levels not easy conditions but should be survivable for humans. 
915	the author using specfic details from studies and historical records to create a claim about how exploring venus is hard due to the harsh conditions 
916	the author also descripes how the the in human condions such as the lack of oxygen, high pressure, extreme heat and erupting volancoes, powerfull earth wuakes and frequent lighting strikes are the reasons why no manned missions to venus had, are , or will ever take place. 
917	""" A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus. Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in VenusÂs atmosphere. On the planetÂs surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet. These conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth; such an environment would crush even a submarine accustomed to diving to the deepest parts of our oceans and would liquefy many metals.

Beyond high pressure and heat, Venusian geology and weather present additional impediments like erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning strikes to probes seeking to land on its surface.""  "
918	Because students should come first, they are the worlds future. And anything we can do to assist them or better their education, should be done. 
919	"In paragraph 2, ""the author says that numerous factors conmtribute to Veunus reputation as a challenging planet for humans to study on"". Another reason why from the author that humans should study venus and wothy pursuit. In paragraph 3, sentence 4 ""it says that the conditions are far moire extreme than anything humans can study on encounter"" "
920	in sted of calling it venus they call is Evening star and it is one of the brightest of the light in the night sky 
921	some could not physically do sportsÂ or stuff like that 
922	That should be something you supposed to do on your own. 
923	When looking at it from earth soemthimes it called Evening stars. Which is one of the brightest points of light in the night sky 
924	Venus is alot different but at the same time alot alike. 
925	"Venus is a planet in our Solar System, Venus gets often referred as the Earth's ""Twin"" due to the density, size and occasionally the closets in distance too "
926	we will never realize or really understand the stuggles and experiments people have to go through just to visit Venus 
927	"Each previous mission was unmanned, and for good reason, since no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours. Maybe this issue explains why not a single spaceship has touched down on Venus in more than three decades."" "
928	Its not any bodys fault that nothing good has come from Venus, 
929	"Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray. Imagine also a blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 miles above the roiling Venusian landscape. Jet airplanes travel and fly over many storms. NASA is working on more apporaches to study Venus and learn more , the good and the bad. They have enormously powerful computers that works with mechanical ,pressure, heat and other forces.  ""vehicle hovering over Venus would avoid the unfriendly ground conditions by staying up and out of their way."" temperatures would still be toasty at around 170 degrees Fahrenheit so humans would feel nice and tostey but its also not easy conditions, but survivable for humans. "
930	"Imagine a city empty of cars and the sounds of bicycles and the sound of chattering children drown out the sound of the occasional motor, This is the city of Vauban. This ""experimental"" district on the ouskirts of Freiburg. Elisabeth Rosenthal, author of  In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars stated ""Street parking, driveways and home garages are generally forbidden in this experimental new district...Vauban's streets are completely ""car-free"" Âexcept the main thotoughfare, where the tram to downtown Freiburg runs. Car ownership is allowed but there are two places to park Âlarge garages at the edge of the development where a car owner buys a space, for $40,000, along with a home.""  This action has inspired some other areas to do the same, As said by Rosenthal, ""Vauban, completed in 2006, is an example of a growing trend in Europe, The United States and elsewhere to seperate suburban life from auto use, as a component of a movement called ""smart planning."""". Now these have been a bit more of pre-emptive measures against Pollution and economic inflation there are those who have taken actions after the fact, Robert Duffer, author of  Paris bans driving due to smog has said ""After days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city."" Now here is where Paris decided to do something silly. ""On Monday motorists with even-numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22-eruo fine ($31). The same would apply to odd-numbered plates the following day."" as stated by Duffer. Now alot of people may not of heard about this or thought it was a joke, Duffer wrote ""Almost 4,000 drivers were fined... 27 people had their cars impounded for their reaction to the fine."" To the people who had heard of this such as companies who their main function is driving from place to place had complained, ""Delivery Companies complained of lost revenue, while exceptions for plug-in cars, hybrids, and cars carrying three or more passengers."" said by Duffer. All of these exceptions that were given out sound as though they are personal transport vehicles that the passengers could just as easily take the public transport.    "
931	How much do we know of Venus? Not much except itÂ´s a planet in space along with the other planets. But who knows what might be in that planet. Venus could have a lot we didnÂ´t think it had, but no one, including myself, have ever study the planet at all. But we can now and see what lies in the planet known as Venus. 
932	"First off, Venus is one of the brightest points of light, making it simple for stargazers. Often called the Ãvening Star"" but the nickname can be misleadinng since the planet Venus is...well a planet. While also very simple to see from the distant safe advantage of Earth, it proves to be a very challenging place to examine more closer. It makes you wonder whatÂ´s even that planet to study about.  Next, VenusÂ´ surface has their temperature average over 800 degrees and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than we experience on our planet. The planetÂ´s conditions Venus has is way more extreme than we thought it would be that we wouldnÂ´t be accustomed to the second we even try to get there. Beyond the high pressure and the heat, Venusian geology and weather present some impediments like volcanoes that can erupt, earthquakes, and frequent lightning strikes to seek land onto its surface. No wonder why Venus is fascinatiing in some peopleÂ´s eyes.  Lastly, going over to Venus with a ship orbiting or hovering safely far above the planet can only have a limit insight on ground conditions since most of the forms canÂ´t penetrate the dense atmosphere. ItÂ´s important to know that researchers cannot take samples of any rock, grass, or anything else in the distance. So if trying to seek to a conduct would have to resolve in getting close and personal despite any risks to do it. "
933	And thatÂ´s what makes Venus the planet that it is today. 
934	Its is known as earths twin. They have sent many space craft all of them have only lasted a hour or so. Thats why they havent send a lot of people up there to stay. It has the hotest tempeter of any planet. They have talked about more visites to Venus. It formiler futers as earth. They want to send people to Venus to study it. THey want to have a car that well be able to just say off the ground so they can go there. They cant take samples or rock or gas that far away from it they wouyld have to be up close. They are working on other wys to be able to go up there and learn more about it. It has went up on how many people want to go up there and explore. 
935	I think the arthor suported the idea well 
936	I think that in the next cople of years people well be able to go there an resurch and get the stuff they want from there. Like studing the rock and whatever ese they have up there. He made a lot of good statments about how we wouldnt be able to get thst close because the remputer is so hot. Even if you whernt thst close it would still be 170 degrees and that is still really hpot and can hurt someone. they would have to figure out a outfit or suit that can make it do its not so hot so they can go up there and resurch. They would have to make a rocket that could float because it the rocket touched Venus it would melt and they would die up there. 
937	Families should have their homes with their cars under their garage. Car ownerships is allowed, but there are only two places to park. When i had a car i was always tense. But passenger cars they are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe. Up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the united states. Its basic precepts are being adapted around the world in attempts to make surburbs more accessible to public transportation. Automobiles are the linchpin of suburbs , where middle-class families from chicago to Shanghai tend to make their homes. 
938	it is very dangreous 
939	Luke reason he joined the program was because he had two part time joby and his friends where going and they asked him if he wanted to go. And Luke could not say no so he went. And he would be missing an opportunity in his life time. Lukes 2 part time jobs where working at a store and a bank.  It was 1945 world war 2 Luke and Don signed up to feed the animals. They has to fees 335 horses. They also had to feed cows, and mules that they had to feed.  It was August 1945 , The boys just recived their order reports to new Orlans.  Luke is now 18 year sold Luke said that they had a sight seeing of Europe and China. It took 2 weeks to cross the Atlantic Ocean. And It took a month to get to China.  Luke surved as a night watch man. He had to feed the animals every hour. So that way they did not have to starve. And cry all night for food and water to eat and drink.  A small strip of metal along the edge stopped his slide, keeping him from flying overboard into the dark Atlantic.  He was happy to be alive. But he couldnÂt work for a couple of days because of cracked ribs.  Luke also found time to have fun and he got to play volleyball, table tennis,boxing and fencing but this happend after they unloaded the animals then they got to have fun and enjoy their time.  Luke crossed the Atlantic Ocean 16 times and he crossed the PAcific Ocean twice to help people affected by World War 2.                                                 
940	Imagine that you are a student, everyday you come home, do your homework, and think about how lousy your day has been, boring right? 
941	Well, having extracurricular activities after school can help with that. 
942	If students decide their project they would have to come up with many of decisions. Students would have so many great memories. Just by this one project many of things happen over summer it would be a good idea to use their experiences from summer on there project. As a student myself I would rather be able to pick my own project. It would let me learn new things and have much more better experience. 
943	"Garvin states that "" It's not easy to target Cydonia,"" and that its hardwork. "
944	to bein with the passage mainly states or really talk bout the things that make up the percent of cair pollution in the airlike 70 pecent of Â and 57 percent of the cars moved car are better then bike because bike your pedaling cars your just pushing the gas and it makes you goes faster 12 pecent of the grenhouse gas emissions from tailpipes to passengers vars are most intensive in the united states all the cars since ww2 had been ways to move equipment to travel long places and miles it was used as the tranportation of amerin cars are the most unrelated.  second of all levitttown and scardale newyork suburbs was a wide spread out homes and private tranportation bills were formed by mister goldberg he said 80 oercent of approriatins have law gone 20 percent to eachother transport the passage also say america have a air pollution record for the most bad pollution in the air in the lobal city wise they say in most cities and countries say for instance china have mor bike riders and walkers do the have cars that y they have so much money because they dint used up allof the observation they save thats why china nd places like africa are rich countries third of of all that why china nights be so cold thats why it dont bethat much sicness because every one know what it takes to not pollute the air and all kinds of nonpoticular things that america does to pollute our air 67 percent of vehicles and france is compared to 57.3 percent of our cars in 73 percent in london well anyways china have long cold nights because its not that much gas or pollution in the air to me and others all scientists thats a good thing.    
945	Hello my name is luke and im am in the Seagoing cowboys program. My friend Don Reist invited me to go to Europe on a cattle boat. I work two part time jobs in a grocery store. It was 1945, World War 2 ended in Europe, and many countries were left in ruins.  This was and opportunity for me to be drafted in the military service.  I couldn't tell my friend no. So I went with him. The cattle-trip were an unbelieveable opportunity for a small -town boy.  Also, 44 nations joined together to form UNRRA(the United Relief and Rehabilitation). I had the side benefit of seeing  Europe and China. Seeing the Acropolis in Greece.  It took about to weeks to cross the Atlantic Ocean from the eastern coast of the united states and a month to get to china.  I was busy caring for the animals during the crossing. My job was to check on the animals every hour. I also found time to have fun on board. We played baseball and volleyball . 
946	In the text, it says that we as humas, we have sent numerous spacecrafts to land on this cloud-draped world and the reason being is because we and he also, wanted to find out more about venus and how it works and many diffrent features 
947	"Venus has a thick type of surface to it. It has a thick atmosphere of 97 percent of carbon dioxide blankets. In the atmosphere of venus, there is a type of acid called ""Sulfuric Acid"" and this acid is basically the determination of the temperture for this planet. The average temperture for venus is 800 degrees Fahrenhiet, and the atmosphere pressure is 90 times greater than what it would be on earth by its-self. Venus also has the hottest surface temperture of any planet in our solar system even though we have mercury closer to the sun venus is still hotter. "
948	"By the 1800's the"" mechanical computer"" that was made for visual insight of venus and other planets around and near earth. These devices made caculations by using gears, and tool like things that hepled scientist in the 1800's up and somewhat past the 1940's. "
949	I think he should join the program beacause he is a good person in the story. Also I think should because he really does anything bad in the story he just things that won't get him in trouble. But also he is a good child in the story he deserves to be in that program because their is no actual reson he can't be part of that program. Also Luke does really deserve to be in that program because i don't think he has been in any other program in his life as it said in the story. But one thing that really stands out to me is that why cant he be part of that program because their really is no reason that he shouldn't be in that program.  Why Luke should be part of the program. I think that Luke should be part of that program because in the story it said that Luke really wants to be in that program because he has worked his whole life to be in that program. And another one of the reasons I think that he should be in that progrsm because he has worked his whole life for to get that program and also in the story it said that Luke would not give up to get into that program and be part of the program because he thinks that he deserves to be in that program and I think that he is qualified to be on that program.  why I think that Luke should be in that program. He deserves to be in that program because he their is no reason he should't be in that program. He is also a hard worker like it said in the text if I was Luke I would never give up to getting into that academy because if that was my dream I would never stop trying to get into that academy because I want to do something important in my life like join the academy Luke wants to join or be a doctor I never give up on my dreams. that why I think Luke should join that academy.                                 
950	so today i will be talking about my opion and how i feel about his whole little computre experssing reader and how do it will it worki and i feel that affects people 
951	According to the packge i just read the computre is a 3d modle that tells reather you sad or happy or any other mixed emotions someone can have if you sad this ad will pop up if you make a angery face anorther will pop up to make sure they read it rigth honstly 
952	i feel like this the dunbst idea every because it seem like technolgy is just taking over the world as it all ready . 
953	I feel liek you should just leave people alone 
954	becauseif they feeling some type of way let them be stop always trying to be nosiey be and somebody bussins its not right stop trying to be caption save o let people be let them leave they life then if people find out you sad gthry going to be all up in your face like just leave people alone and let them be  
955	In Conclusion i think the idea is stupid ion think you should do it yall just letting tecnolgy take all the way over i feel yall shoukd just let people be if somebody want someone to they moody they will tell them maybe talking about it make them madder then what they is you never know thsts why its important to mind your bussins 
956	they spend their time outside to play sports also students have gym classes where they do many different activitys. 
957	They talk about what they going to bring and how far it is and what they are going to be doing. in the passage he talked about what happen in the war and how did it affect . and maybe having electronics up there too. 
958	This passage describe venus 
959	In this passage I learned alot that i did not know about. I personally think he did good in this passage because he made me learn and i enjoyed reading this passage . I learn about venus and learn about NASA and what they might going to do.  
960	This story is about evaluating The Challenge of Exploring Venus. In the first paragraph it is kinda misleading because it says that venus sometimes called the evening star is one of the brightest points of light in the night sky. Then it goes on to talk about how venus is also a planet so the name is very misleading. Then paragraph two it talks about how its a planet again not a star and its saying that its the closest planet to earth.  
961	Venus is the closest planet to earth and yet to there has been a spacecraft to survive the landing. Although it could be a little bit tough seems haw venus's atmosphere is almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets and the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in venus's atmosphere. On venus surface the temperatues average over 800 degrees fahrenheit. With that kind of heat and pressure could even crush a submarine. 
962	In conclusion the story had some great details about what venus was like compared to earth but i also think that it was a little misleading about star planet and i think that could have been fixed up so it didnt have you on your toes trying to find out wether or not it was a star or a planet that was earths twin. 
963	Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size, and accasionally the closest in distance too. the speed between Mars, Venus, and Earth orbit the sun in different speeds. these difference in speed mean that sometimes we are closer to Mars and other times venus  A thick atmosphere of almost 97% carbon dioxide blankets venus. even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmophere. on the planet's surface, tempers average over 800 degrees 
964	this showws how dangerous it s trying to study venus specially with the high percentages that this story has about venus. 
965	"Paragraph 4 the authour asks "" if our sister planet is so inhospitable, why are scientist even discussing further visit to its surface?"" he states that astronomers are fasinated by planet in our solor system , long ago, Venus was probably covered large;y with oceans and could have supported varous forms of life, just like earth. Today,  Venus still has some features that are analogous to those on Earth. "
966	If other countries need help or something like water or food or something like that like maybe more homes to build for the homeless.  Another good thing about it is that you can travel around the world and the states like if there are more animals do in need because they are in danger and almost extinct!  The best part is that you go out around the world and help out everything and if you are in the news for that and the people see that you were on the news with all of you friends then they might as well congratulat you.  
967	This gives you a good feeling of helpfulness and compassion. I love to save lives, especially if they're animals'. I also liked to be freinds with them. Even though there are many other people on the boat with you, the creatures all have their own personalities, and this makes them fun to hang out with. 
968	I have seen the Acropolis in Greece, the Panama Canal, and an excavated castle in Crete. I have been to Europe, China, and Italy. You can go to all of these places, see these sights, and more if you join their program. 
969	There are many indrustries and or companys that have created electronic cars. Charging our cars many be difficlut for long road trips but there could be a slot for gas for when our battery level is running low we can get some gas to reach a destination and charge it. 
970	I dont think technology can tell someone in emotes by scanning their face. 
971	It cant go thou are mind and say they are feeling sad 
972	If it is true I would not use because if they are using it as a govement weapon to find if some one is hinding some well needed things and they start to used this and if it gives them wrong information that person might be in some trouble 
973	And the other way around if they have some need information and the FACS or Facial Action Coding System just lost it. 
974	First how big is it? Is it the size of a gym or is it as small as a Iphone 4? This computer is just a big fake.  
975	Second how much does it cost? Is it the same to build it as much as a lamborigini or as much as a pencil? Third, how long does it take to build it. And how long does it last for. 1 minites or 3 hours. How long does it scan for. 
976	The passage talks about all the positive and negative things that would make Venus be good to study because of some of theories of it being Earth like 
977	"In the text it says that ""A thick atmoshpere of almost 97% carbon dioxide blankets Venus."" "
978	This Is saying that its very dangerousover there on Venus and the pressure could destroy everything there. 
979	In Conclusion he gives his full support no matter what. He is hoping that they keep striving to find a way to successsfuly accomplish whatever they need to do. 
980	i tthink we shouldnt be able to have technology read are emotions if we dont want it to. 
981	they talk about how a home pc cant handle the complex algorithms used to decode someone simle. i think that should make it where no matter what you use it on it can run it. with out having to write it down 
982	what if someone is fake smiling. is your technology going to be able to tell if your really happy or not? I think it not a good idea because one it doesnt tell you all the emotions that the person is feeling and what if the person doesnt want one or doesnt like it and they aloud ti get rid of it or do they have to keep it. I know i wouldnt want someone else to tell me my emotions so i surely dont want some technology telling me how i feel . 
983	"Venus is the second planet it also is the hottest planet which is never be touched i a spaceship since 3 decades. It is sometimes called ""Evening Star' becuase it is one on the brightest points of the light in the sky. It was often told that the planet Venus was the twin of Earth because they have the same size, they often send numerous of spaceships to Venus to see if it would work out because when they would send some it would always burn through.  "
984	Venus is a thick atmosphere of almost 90% of carbon dioxide in Venus. NASA's is doing investigations on how they can gp put some spaceships on the planet without buring down, so they are using high technlogy to go check the hot planet Venus. Scientist are working on approaching to study on Venus so they can be able to let people know more information about it.  
985	Finally. Venus is a planet close to the sun, its even the hottest planet ever. Nobody wants to go to Venus because its hot and you can die by going into Venus and knowing that scientists don't want to go put a foot on the planet because they're scared they going to die or anything bad is going to happened. 
986	"In this article the author is telling us that facts about Venus how it's called the ""Evening star"" because it's the ""brightest points of the light in the sky night"" and it is a good place to examine, because of how close it is to the sun and earth, of its tempature, its heat, pressure, and how no spacecraft have landed there. "
987	If it had not been discovered what would we think about the red planet. The planet would just be another planet close to earth. 
988	If we could get a human on the red planet that would be great. We can't do that yet. It will not happen for another 400 to 500 years. This is a long wait time, but in the end it is all going to be worth every hour put in.  The red planet has many mysteres we will never know. This one will be around for years to come. The next generation will find out if life is out there. If they find it make contact. 
989	Today my sister and I created a mess of emissions just getting to school to take this test that is completely worthless. I do not gain from this test, nor do my proctors who have to dilligently coach a hundrded students through a bogus set of instructions for this bogus test 
990	For each one person in the room where i'm taking this worthless test, hundreds of cubic feet in carbon monoxide gas have been released into the atmosphere. When this test is over it will be sent to some place, probably in the northern part of Florida for a bunch of people to grade. Test by test. They too must create huge emmissions to get to the place where they grade this test. Or do they? We have no idea who created this test, why we're taking it, or even the slightest insight of who's grading it or if it will even be graded! We're like a bunch of helpless test animals deprived of sleep because we have to write some bogus test. I look around me in this room and there is at least 40 people who I can see are pouring their hearts out on this test. I did yesterday, and for what? I cant be proud about this essay I just wrote, or even share it with my family, there is hardly even a record I took this darn thing. They tell us that we're setting the bar high for other schools but for what reason. Why would you strive to be better than someone who has writen their sole out on this essay. Its supposed to be special with origionality! These are supposed grades that you ace because you wrote a beautiful essay you cherished, and took pride in and even brought in other authors to make your work stronger, then you hear that that essay you submitted was to set the bar high for people we've never met. What kind of sick mind creates prompts for sudents to devote themselves to school and greatness and makes them take this whole thing just to see how it went? Why dont you make this thing worth a goal? Give us an incentive! It's so rediculous that I have to sit here and write about car emissions when I dont drive. You should turn this around on yourslef and ask why you did it. Why the hell do you need to test us on the daily basis like this. This test is an outrage and a discrase that should not even be thought about. I have better stuff to do. I want to learn about the things essential to me, not some foney worthless writing essay about car emmissions in France. This whole thing is so irrelevent to me it's sick. For me to use up energy and valuable time is something like this is not in charactar for me. And to think I have to sit here for another hour and thirty minutes. I feel sorry that my school and I have to put up with this crap. This test was a giant waste of time, you dont deserve my response and screw you for putting me and 500 other people through this. Before you even try to do this again ask yourself if what you're doing is right, if it's worth other peoples while. I want someone who made this test happen to read my little rant to see how students really feel. I know I speak for many of my peers with this writting. If you're just reading this and have nothing to do with me receiving this test, no hard feelings. Have a great day and thanks for taking your valuable time to read this. I hope its more compeling then reading about car emissions. :^)   
991	time is something that passes all the time 
992	However, some students not have information about summer projects and they did not like to complete the summer projects from teachers in the summer. 
993	all 44 major muscal in the model must move like a human muscles, six basic emotion happiness,surpris, anger disgust ,fear and sadness,even though indivduals often sshow varying degrees of expression like not smiliing as broadly.  in real face or in the panted face of mona lisa. by weighting the different units the oftware can even identify mixed emotions, most of us would have troble actually decribing each facial trait the conveys happy,worried.  the mona Lisa demonstration is relly intended to bring a smile to your face ,whike it just how this computer can do, putting on a happy face actually work,you can tell probably how a friend is feeling simply by the book on her face. the the mona lisa demonstration is really intendedvto bring a smile to her face, a classroom computer could recognize when a student is becomeing confused or bored. 
994	that would be unseen for there to be a computer of any such to even exist. 
995	so basically saying that a simple computer would help a think that would't be amanzing.            
996	FACS can classify six basic emotions happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness just by seeing the the movements of your facial muscles. 
997	"In paragraph three the passage states, ""The process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face; all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles. Movement of one or more muscles is called an ""action unit."" Then Dr. Huang relies on the work of psychologists, such as Dr. Paul Eckman, creator of FACS (Facial Action Coding System). Eckman has classified six basic emotions- happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness-and then associated each with characteristic movements of the facial muscles."" "
998	What this can prove is that the process of expression recognization requires no harm to the face or person and is created by the studies of not only technological professionals, but also psychological preoffesionals as well. 
999	In the world like the one today, reliability and consistently are key. People today enjoy things that are useful and fun. The children of this generation especially want that. Before the children can age and make something with their lives, someone along the road has to teach them 
1000	When looking at the Mona Lisa painting it was sucessful and was one of Leonardo da Vinci's biggest accomplishment was the painting of Mona Lisa. Some of the new comptuer software that can recognize emotions, It was sucessful because the software is the latest innovation from Professor Thomas Huang of the Beckman Institute for Advance Science at the University of Illinois with collaboration with Professor Nicu Sebe Of the University of Amsterdam.  
1001	The auther supports his idea by writing a paraghragh and putting in ideas or what people reserach. 
1002	I think we should explore venus because venus might have the material that earth has not 
1003	The next thing I want to say is that we can use venus as a waypoint for space ships to go back and refule and get things to explore new planets 
1004	"Also I thinks what the sciencetists says on paragraph 1 ""Developing better ways for humans and computers to communicate"", this means that they said like it better for all people if they developing a software that can recognize emotions.  Another good things about the emotion recongnition like what it says on paragraph 4 because the software can also recognize faces on a pictures.  If the new computer software that can tells people emotions, sciencetists should make them more valuable like adding more news features to it and that will make more people to like them.            "
1005	Now if it was for an expermint to see how you are really feeling then go ahead 
1006	but only for an expermint 
1007	here it says that Dr. Huang studies different artists and there paintings and how some showed how they used there emotion and some didn't. 
1008	because when a kid is doing there homework and the kid is bored the computer is going to detect that the kid is bored from doing his/her homework and put a add with a video game and the kid is going to get distracted and fail the assingment. 
1009	I agree that some schools should let students do summer projects sometime over the summer. 
1010	Multiple reasons where given such as comparing Venus to Earth, 
1011	looking back at the two planets history, 
1012	If somoene is das you can see it nut you don't know how they feel inside. 
1013	You can probobbly draw a picture of them or soemthing instead of using tecnology. Also any type of facial expression sould be valuable in the classroom. You can't really judge a book by it cover. So really there is no need of using tecnology to see somones looks or to make them that way. Everyone has differnt reactions to differnt things. 
1014	this invension would be a good project to go around at the airport or banks just to see peoples reaction when they walk in and as there going out to see the diffrence of there face reactions. 
1015	the mona lisa demonstration is really intended to bring a smile while it shows how much this computer can do,imagine a computer that knows when youre happy or sad, thatll be really creapy once it knows how you're feeling. 
1016	"""of course, most of us would have trouble actually describing each facial trait...""(Ph5), we have these troubles because we are notfeeling what they are feeling.  "
1017	Hello everyone I am Luke the Seagoing Cowboy 
1018	I turned 18 when i was in way to Greece. I was able to be darte d for military service and they said to countine my military service. I also admit but it was a great oppertunity for me. 
1019	I felt really pitty for them beacase the war has not started because of them and they are starvng well for no reason. 
1020	People could have said they even spotted it, but then again since their on video, they could have photoshopped it. People can believe what they want to believe, but if you can see there's perfect evidence, you can't really argue if they have real proof. 
1021	In the first paragraph the author says Â¨Venus, sometimes called the Evening Star, is one of the brightest points of light in the night sky, making it simple for even an amateur stargazer to spot.Â¨. In that quote it is saying that the Evening star is so bright that someone is not really paying attention could see it because it is so bright it can not be missed. It is also saying that it is one of the brightest points of light which means if you are lost you could look up and hopefully see that star and it will give you some light to find your way. 
1022	Another quote from paragraph one is Â¨However, this nickname is misleding since Venus is actually a planet. In our solar system, Venus is the second planet from our sunÂ¨. This quote means that even though Venus looks like a star because it extremely bright, and shows off an extreme amout of light it is a planet. Many people mistake Venus as a star but once they find out it is a planet they are amazed because of the brightness of it 
1023	In my opinion I think that the planets should all be different sizes and densities because of the fact that everything is different. When it comes to planets they should all be different sizes, so that people can easily point out the planets and be able to name them easily and not get them mixed up because of them looking the same size in the atomosphere 
1024	In the passage in paragraph three it says Â¨A think atomosphere of almost 97% carbon dioxide blankes VenusÂ¨. In this quote it states that most of Venus is covered in carbon dioxide. If scientists wanted to go study Venus they would have to have many layers of protection on because carbon doxide can be very harmful to the human body. Especially since the carbon dioxide percentage is so high it can extrmely hurt the human body of anyone that goes to Venus to study it 
1025	Tell me would you let them use and technology to read your emotions somepeople would say yes somepeople would no because either the way it goes your still messing being in somebodys else bussnies and some people don't like when they do things like this makes people think that where watching their life 
1026	If you sign up you'll get the im-not-gonna-regret-this kind of feeling. CRACK!Is what the boat does whenever you hit a rock but you wont have to pay for the damage we will. If you want to work for us more than two years the boat you drive will be yours thats right folkes well give you the boat. All you got to do is sign your name and well even throw in a free sailer out fit with new shoes and hat. Once you get the hang of it you'll be like this is a peace of cake. The boat comes with a horn that will-tell-everyone-the-boat-is-okay and so are you,but all you have to do is sign a couple of papers and fill some documents out. 
1027	I think that if we ever did find aliens on Mars or even a civilazation we should stay away from it. The reason why is because if we ever did find a other planet we never really be called the only planet in the universe. In the article we found out that we have a new way to find people. We never really thought that their was ever a civilazation on Mars. 
1028	As we found out that we may have found a way to a other civilazation. I just recently told you that we should never go near Mars. The reason why I told you that is because we don't now their lifes, their ways, or even if they were freindly. When NASA told us that we have a way to find people we should never talk to them. Yes it does show that we had images of planet Mars or even that their might have been a culture.  
1029	I have said that we should never really go to planet Mars because if we did we would be the only planet in the universe. This article was very interesting, but I think we should never go near Mars. 
1030	Obama's studys show that more and more americans are not driving and not getting there licenses as each year goes by. And they wonder has america passed peak driving. On april 2013 the number of miles driven per person went down 9 percent. 
1031	If there were life on Mars they would try to keep the form from changing, right? 
1032	It really makes time fly by so much quicker . I've beenn doing this for what now,2years? And i've already been on 9 trips! Though sitseeing is not the only thing we do we trasport animals to country's in need . So far it's been a huge success and we don't want to look back, not yet. 
1033	So, why not bring them with you i'm pretty sure we would have more then enough things for you children to do. Remeber this is a very serious and dangerous job . I've gotten through a only one bad injury where I broke a rib .(paragraph7). That will be very unlikely to happen though considering none of my parteners have ever had that happen to them.  
1034	People might agree with Car-free day. But i disagree with it. Now i will tell you three why I disagree. 
1035	There are people who probaly have to go to work across the city or maybe even another state. Others probaly dont own bikes or any alternative transportation. Few other people are just not fit and would have to stop and get a brake because there to tired. Also people might have night shifts and it would be dangerous to walk the streets at night. Last you might make it late to the bus stop and you'll have to wait forever for it to pass by again. 
1036	Sure people have cars but that doesnt mean they make alot of money so in that case they probaly cant afford to take that form of transportation. More than likely the buses and taxi's are raising the prices for that day since alot more people are taking them. Alot of people would be taking this form of transportation so that means you either would be on a packed bus or be waiting for a taxi that has ten other customers waiting. 
1037	"In Source One the story talks about the advanges of redusing car usage in the German areas. It states that cars produse about 12% of greenhouse gas in Europe and about 50% in major car usage areas in the United States. Also, street parking is generally forbidden on the outskirts of Freiburg. Even though Vauban's street are completly ""car-free"", except the main thoroughfare. Car ownership is allowed, but there is only two places to park, in a large garage outside their development where a space costs $40,000, or in their own homes. Because of this, about 70% of families in Vauban don't own car(s). Along with 57% of people that sold their car so they could move to Vauban.  In Source Two, in Paris, everyone who drove a car was fined, in two days about 4000 peopole were fined? That isnt actually a alot for a whole city, which is great news. Paris uses diesel fuel instead of gasoline, and now Paris is blaming that on their air pollution. Paris usually has more smog than any other European capital.  In Source Three, Bogota, Colombia has the Day Without Cars, where only public buses and taxis are allowed to drive in the city, anyone driving a car will be fined $25. the Day Qithout Cras started in the mid-1990s, and since then 118 miles of bicycle paths have been built. Parks and sport areas have also been built, along with more restaurants and shops near streets that used to be heavy with traffic, but now leave room for people to stop and visit.  In Source Four, it states that in the United States, young people driving decreased by 23% between 2001 and 2009. Recent studies show that Americans are buying fewer cars and getting fewer licenses each year.    "
1038	if we go to the second planet from the sun the gravity would be more tense and would have different affects on humans. the gravity on venus would pull them down more than earth because it is closer to the sun by two planets away. but we also need to think about the air and the atmosphere because if we just go there then we might die. the air on venus is un supportive to humans and the water is not there or it might be a type of water that if you drink it it will kill you. the storms on venus are acid storms, the rain is acid. so i think the only reason why the author is saying that venus is a challenge is because not only the facts above. but also that the fact is that on the serface, temperetures average over 800 degrees fahrenheit. and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we humans experience on earth. so he also might be saying that it might be a challenge because if we take a rocket, it might be torn apart if we dont have the right mesurements. 
1039	Most of the residents in Germany have given up their cars.  Vauban's streets are completely ''car-free'', this means that no one except for the main thoroughfare and a few streets on one edge of the community have cars. This movement is called ''smart planning.''  This movement helps the greenhouse gas emissions in Erope. Passenger cars are reponsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe, and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States, this evidence is given in paragraph 5.  David Goldberg states on paragraph 7 that all the development since the World War II has been centered on cars, he is promoting new communities that are less dependent on cars.  In source 2 the autor talks about one of the biggest advantages of limiting car usage, by cleaning the air from pollution. Cold nights ans warm days cased the warmer layer of air to trap car emissions. In Bogota, Colombia they are doing a program that is called ''Car-free'' this is a program that allows people to have a day without using their cars, in souce 3 
1040	In conclusion Venus is very dangerous, it has high temperatures and high pressure which the humans can not survive. Earth and Venus may have the same mountains and valleys, but Venus is to hot for us to survive. In conclusion Venus is dangerous to study.   
1041	In this essay i amfoing to be talking about a claim for or against of using technolgy to read students and emotional expressions. 
1042	I would say i am on both sides. 
1043	i say that because i think it could be a good thing but i also think there would be sone bad things with that too. 
1044	One reason why it would be good is to see if the person is just not happy at all then you could talk to them and see whats going on with them. So you can see if you can fix it. Another reason why i think its a good thing is because it tell the peron your doing it to and you how there expressions are. I also fill like this could be a good thing because if the person is going threw a hard point in their life then this would be good. The reson why this could be good is because then you could help them out before they do anything to them self. another thing that this would be good for is if you r going to go do something and the other person has a expression on there face you cant tell how they feel about it then yoiu can use this technology to see if it bothers them or not. There was a claim in the story that they figured how the person felt before doing something. 
1045	I think it could be bad because the parents of the kid or the kid himself may not like you doing this sort of thing on him. This is why im kinda on both sides because if they wont done to them I could understand that so thats why i think its fine to not do it if you don't want to. They might not want you to because they might just not want you to know about some of there personal life.  
1046	One reason is that schools shouldn't allow anyone to put that technology into their computers because that technology has nothing to do with school or what the kids are learning at school. 
1047	If a student is feeling happy or surprise its okay for people to know, but when a sudent is feeling angry, disgust, fear, and sad it's not because you don't know what that person is going through or how that person is living. 
1048	Students when they are given freedom or multiple options tend to tweak and stretch the guidelines to make it easier or to even make excuses on why they didn't do a certain part or do it a certain way 
1049	Some people thinks its funny to watch other contenets to bein war. 
1050	I don't like to see our allies in war whille we stayed and watched. 
1051	another problem i could see is can it take one face or a whole class room of faces. 
1052	students can learn new things for example playing sports includes learning how to play. 
1053	Making new friends in other activities like student council 
1054	having interaction with other peers like in the yearbook committee. 
1055	Second, students can meet new peers and become friends with each other 
1056	If your having difficulties with time, its important to communicate with your parents, I amÂ sure they can figure something out. 
1057	For projects with the intentions to keep students learning while on summer break the first issue would be students making projects on subjects that have no relevance to school, this would be very inefficient in the efforts made by school boards to keep students learning. 
1058	My Claim About The Author Idea That Studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite it's more important because it's the closest planet next to Earth and it gets more attention then the other planets because it's closer to us humans 
1059	I jus feel like that's the more important planet & it's value, but my explantion about my claim in this article 
1060	"In the article it says Venus is referred to as Earth ""twin"" and it's the closet to Earth & the also call Venus the ""Evening Star"" its the brightest light in the night sky and a another fact I can say it's in between the Sun and The Earth and I think thats why it make it so special even though Mercury is Closer Too The Sun and in the text it says ""Venus has the hottest surface temperture of any planet in the solar system and Venus haves features that are analogous to those on Earth so in my opinon Venus has almost alot of things to do with or deal with Earth. "
1061	Soon after his high school graduation, his friend invited him to join the program. Luke thought about it and decided to sign up with his friend after he realized it was a once in a lifetime opportunity. Luke knew that it was hard work, but he learned about all hard work on his aunt Katie's farm. 
1062	in hopes of venus returning like its older self, scientists are looking into a way to explore the planet 
1063	"Now for a story. In my entire life ive only had one summer project and it was back in middle school. The goal was to just read a chapter book and then to write about it. That year i had read all 6 of the star wars books from ""Phantom Menace"" to ""The Jedi Return"". But i decided to write about ""Revenge of The Sith"" which is my favorite book/movie from the prequel era. I honeslty didnt know how to start the writing ,as a surpirse to no one I was and still am a pretty weak writer. But eventually I came around to write about Anakins insecuritys and the fact no one was honestly there to help him through his dark time and that it consumed him even making him hurt the ones he loved. Now keep in mind I had finished about a week into summer so I was pretty much free to do what I wanted. That same summer I had traveled to Honduras for 2 and a half months to visit. But as soon as I returned school was satrting and I had completely forgotten about the assignment and to put the icing on the cake It was lost. "
1064	The author supports this idea 
1065	I know some people don't like to go to school and they just want to stay home and play video games or sleep. Rather than going to school, but your parents still force you to go to school. And teachers look confused and saying whats wrong with our students. And don't know what to do. And most teacher are tired of students sleeping and thinking its a waste of their time and most quit. 
1066	The face was found around the 1990s by a ship named the Viking 1 in shearch for a possible landing sites for its sister ship the Viking 2. The face is about 2miles from end to end. A few days after scientists figured it was another Martian mesa NASA reveiled the photos to try to atract public atentin to Mars. 
1067	"they thought that the face was a ""bona fide"" evidence of life on Mars. the face was everywhere it appeared in a Hollywood film, in books, magazines, radio talk shows,and even haunted grocery stores. In September 1997 the Chief scientist for NASA's Mars Exploration Program sent a [MGS] Mars Global Surveyor to take a pictuer of the face. "
1068	Luke Bomberger worked two part-time job at the grocey store and at the bank. Then his friend invited him to go to a Europe on a cattle boat. It was hard for him to say no but Luke said yes it was a opportunity of a lifetime.  World War 2 was over in the Europe,and many countrys were ruin. To help recover everything 44 Nations joined together to form UNRRA. The UNRRA hired the Seagoing Cowboys for they can take care of the horses,young cow,and mules were shipped oversea.  In August 1945, they had received their orders repoets from New Orleans. They had arrived on August 14 that's the day the Pacific war ended. Don and Lke boarded the ship the SS Charles W. Wooster, and then they headed to Greece. THe SS Charles also had a cargo of 335 horses plus enough hay and oat so they can eat.  Luke turned 18 before arriving in Greece.  It took about two weeks to criss the Atlantic Ocean from the east coast of the united states and the a month to get to china. Luke was really busy because caring for the animals during them crossing the ocean. Also he had to fed them and watered two or three times a day. Bales of hay and bages of oats had to be pulled up from the lower holds of the ship. And then he had to clen the Stalls.  On his second trip Luke had to served his night as a watchman. His job was to check on the animal every hour. On this one rainy night after making his hourly report to the captain he slid down a slippery ladder on his backside. Luke's heart was racing as he shot first toward an opening ont he side of the ship . A small strip of metal along the edged stopped his slid keeping him from flying forward overboard in the dark Atlantic. But he couldn't work for a couple of day because of his cracked ribs.  Luke also had fun on his trip because when the unloaded the animals the cowboys played basketball and volleyball. Also they played table-tennis tournament, fencing, and boxing.  But being a the Seagoing Cowboys was much more than an adventure for Luke Bomberger . It opened his world it was a greatful opportunitiy for him. It made him more aware of people of other countries and their needs. Alot of visitor came over the year to exchange the students to visit. 
1069	Also what was the main reason why I took this opportunity. Was the main reason because it was opportunity of a lifetime. Think it over and find 3 main reasons why you took this opportunity. 
1070	I understand why Luck did what he did. What im trying im trying to say here is why he crossed the Atlantic Ocean 16 times and the Pacific Ocean twice to help people affected by World War II. What I dont unnderstand is what was his main reason. 
1071	"Reasons why I think it wouldn't be a good idea because in the text in paragraph six it says that ""Many researchers are working on innovations that would allow our machines to last long enough to contribute meaningfully to our knowledge of Venus"". In my own words I believe it is not safe because what if it doesn't last long ? "
1072	I would not want a computer telling people, or evem myself, what mood i am in. 
1073	. why would you have something in there that can be wrong 
1074	 People in this world always going off on what people say or showing them computers dont always be right 
1075	i would never go and get a computer to help me with my problems because they dont know everything plus why would you want it in the classroom anyway , someone can come steal it or anything you never now a days people is doing all types of stuff 
1076	But the moral of the story is that no i would never but this comuputer its a good brand to the school and all but i would just not get one.  - but we all know i would never get one of these computers  -This is what i think of the Facial Action Coding System Computer  
1077	Imagine learning about school during summer break. School should not require students to do summer projects in the summer time. Also school shouldn't ruin students free time. Students shouldn't have to worry about school during their free time. 
1078	Also if they are designed by students it can keep people off the streets. It can also bring people together and stop a lot of bullying. And when students come together they can make a big impact on the community and influence other to be smart. 
1079	I'm much happier this way said Heidrun Walter a media trainer and mother of two.  
1080	"The way this process work is to have the computer with 3-D contructs and a computer model of the face and have to build the human like human muscles which it's called ""action unit""  which made by Dr. Huag and Dr. paul Eckman, the creator of facts of ""facial action coding system"". during his own creation he knows the six basic emotions like happiness, surrise, anger, disguet, fear and sadness plus characteristic movements of that new computer model they making out of 3-D.  It says that when the computer model wakes up everyday it have the same impressive calculation so it really means it still acts the same from yesterday like saying when u have a friend that like being happy randomly from yesterday well your friend can still act the same the next day which you is wathing your temper, when Dr. Huang haves a computer soft where that stores similar anatomical information as electronic code. "
1081	When you try to make computer models on your own at home wit a PC it might not work on yours ether way because you'll need a newer model of it so it can work it doesn't have enough storge to carry all tha data, so some people rarely take the long way which is writing it down for instruction that encode different emotions.  
1082	Even looking in a mirror you can look at yourself and see how you act with your emotions so you can make your own model and aftyer when you are done, you can tell your lab partners to test it out to see if it's really complete to make a fully computer model and that model will have the same emotions as you, plus not only you'll be happy about it you truely know how to reveal so much about the science of emotions.   
1083	Car use can be a good or bad thing depending on how you look at it, but most of the time people have strong opinions on car use.  
1084	advantages of limiting car usage 
1085	If scientists were able to study Venus, it would help us undertsnad the planet more. 
1086	Our first reponse to them was that it was simply not possible because aliens do not exist. 
1087	Even if they did we did not think that it was going to be possible for them to do something like this. 
1088	Our second reason we do not think it was aliens was because they would not have the brians to do this 
1089	They would not be able to calculate the right measurments and angles also. Plus we dont think they would be able to survive on Mars because of the conditions that are there. These aliens would just have to be out right smart to do something like this. This is just one of those things that seem impossible for an alien to do. 
1090	If we are being logical here we know that the pyrimads were created by humans them selves but do really think an alien could have done this? We do not think so because they are just not as smart and and not as equpit as a human is. We think that it was a land form God decided to give the planet. 
1091	First, She's 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry. No that's not your science teacher, grading your latest lad assignment. It's the subject of leonardo da vinci's renaissance painting, Mona Lisa- at least according to some newsoftware that can recognize emotions. 
1092	"Your home PC can't handle the complex algorithms used to decode Mona Lisa's smile. But we can write down some simple instructions that ""encode"" different emotions. Eckman has classified six basic emotions- happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness- and then associated each with characteristic movements of the facialc muscles. "
1093	"even though individuals often show varying degrees of expressions""(like not smiling as broadly). Using video imagery, the new emotion - recognition software tracks theese facial movements- ina real face or on the painted face of Mona Lisa. By weighting the different units, the software can even identitfy mixed emotions(as in da Vinci's master piece). Each expression is compared against a neutral face (showing no emotion). "
1094	Luke had no idea that his life would change so soon after his high school graduation. He was working two part-time jobs in agrocey store and a bank when his friend Don invited him to go to Europe on a cattle boat. Luke couldn't say no.  In 1945, World War 2 was over in Europe,and manu countries were left ruins. To help these countries recover their food and supplies,animals, and more, 44 nations joined together to help the nation they are called the Seagoing Cowboys to take care of the horses, young cows, and mules that were shiped overseas.  By the time he was discharged in 1947,Luke had made nine trips-the most of any Seagoing Cowboy. I had the side benifit of seeing Europe and China. But seeing the Acroplis in Greece was special,he says. So taking a gondola ride in Venice,Italy,a city with streets of water. A cargo of 335 horses plus enough hay and oats to feed them.  It took two weeks to cross the Atlantic Ocean from the eatern coast of the United States and a month to get to china. Caring for animals during the crossings kept Luke busy. They fed the animals three times a day water,bales of hay,and bags of oats. Stalls had to be cleaned.  
1095	One of the things the is keeping people so interested is that Venus at one time was supposedly the most Earth like planet in our solar system. 
1096	"One of the reasons we believe Venus used to be like Earth is because of its nottable past. ""Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like earth"". "
1097	This a one time offer. You don't know how long this opperation will be running. 
1098	Based on the passage , the government would like a change in the way people drive their cars around. Some people would just get in the car and ride all day and night if they could. So what do the head source of some countries even took the drastic measures of baning driving due to so much smog and health problems in the air. Almost 4,000 drivers would be fined becuase of their actions to the news.  In a program that's set to spread to other countries, millions of colombians hiked, biked, skated or took the buses to work. It was the third straight year cars have been banned with only buses and taxis permitted for the day without carsin this capital of 7 million. Of course the goal was to reduce smog and promote alternative transportation. The turnout was huge, despite gray clouds that dumped occasional rain showers on bogota. for the first time two other Colombian cities, cali and valledupar, joined the event. The day without cars is part of an improvment campain that began in Bogota in the mid-1990s.  The United States, with its broad expanses and suburban ideals, had long been of the world's prime car cultures. It is the home of Detroit, which by the way has the most and biggest car production in the U.S. alone, its also the bithplace of the first car ever the Model T. Demographic shifts in the driving population suggest that the trend may accelerate. There has been a large drop in the percentage of 16- to 39-year-olds getting a license, while older folk are likely to retain their license as they age 
1099	I still dont agree with the idea of projects during summer though because thats what fourth quarter projects should be about. 
1100	"One shouldn't be forced to do school work over a time when you are supposed to be enjoying the summer off. One of my favorite sayings is from Allen Iverson when he said,""Practice? Your'e talking bout practice? I am an All Star and you are talking about practice?"" That is what I would think about if a teacher emailed me during the summer and is talking to me about doing a project when i should be resting. What's the point of summer if you are just going to be doing school work?   Â  Â  "
1101	The gorveners and presitdent are trying to bane cars for good. 
1102	Also the author talk's about venius having no value . 
1103	The author say's that Venus has no value because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors . 
1104	Hi my name is PROPER_NAME and I work for NASA discussing with someone who thinks that the face was created by aliens

1109	"The author states that, ""NASA is working on different approaches to studying Venus."" "
1110	According to the essay, Venus is often refered to as eaths twin because ofit's similar size, density and occassionally the close distance to earth. Another fact is that They took the time to research Venus' atmosphere, which is 97% carbon dioxide blankets over the planet itself. It goes on to inform us about the weather systems and the environment Vus really holds behind those thick blankerts of gas. Another supporting claim for their research is that they go through the history of what we know about Venus and or speculate it was like. Thhey also talk about what the future could look like if we do intend to explore Venus. 
1111	Only samples that they can never find to be true 
1112	because that is something they would call classified just to keep everybody from going insane. 
1113	Public transportation could be expensive and, frankly, overcrowded, but it provi     
1114	"The author supports this idea. That Venus is actually a planet. in our solar system, Venus is the second planet from our sun. While Venus is simple to see from the challenging place to examine more closely. Often referred to as Earth's twin,"" Venus is the closest planet to Earth in term of density and size, and occasionally the closest in distance too. Earth, Venus, and Mars, our other planetary neighbor, orbit the sun at different speeds. These differences in speed mean that sometimes we are closer to Mars and other times to Venus. Numerous factors contribute to Venus's perputation as a challenging planet for humans to study, despite its proximity to us.  A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus. Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere. On the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet. These conditions are far more extreme than anything human encounter on Earth; such an eveironment would crush even a submarine accustomed to diving to the deepest parts of our oceans and would liquefy many metals.  If our sister planet is so inhospitable, why are scientists even discussing further visits to its surface? Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar sytem. Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth. Today, Venus still has some feartures that are analogous to those on Earth The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features sych as valleys mountains, and creaters. Furthermore, recall that Venus can sometimes be our nearest option for a planetary visit,a crucial consideration given the long time farmes of space travel. The value of returning to Venus seems indisputable, but what are the optionsfor making such a mission both safe and scientifically productive?  The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has one particulry compelling ideafor sending humans to study Venus. NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions on the the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fary. Imagine a blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the roiling Venusian landscape. Just as our jet airplanes travel at a higher altitude to fly over many storms, a vehicle hovering over Venus would avoid the unfriendly ground conditions by staying up and out of their way. at thirty-plus miles above the surface, temperature would still be toasty at around 170 degrees Fahrenheit, but the air pressure would be close to that of sea level on Earth.  Striving to meet the Challenge presented by Venushas value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors. our tarvels on earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation.

1116	Or the ones that want to learn more about a other laenguech they can just stay in the same class that they have the leangucj they want to learn about and just tell the teacher if they can stay after or not no if the teacher is gonna stay after for then they can stay after and learn more of the leanguch they are learning about. The students that are in sports they can just stay after pratising with other students on the soccer filled. And for the student council students can just do what the student council dos because i have no idia what is or what it means . 
1117	because it is very helpful for all students when they need to look up something. They can find everything very quickly, and more easy with using the techonoly. 
1118	"As the article said ""Imagine being able to detact exactly how other people are felling, even when they are trying to hide their emitions."" We can look up at the techlongy to tell how many percent happy, disgusted, fearful, and angry on the imagine.

Car ownership is ownship is allowed, but there are only two place to park large garge at the edge of development, where a car ower buys a space, for $40,000, along with a home. &0 percent of Vauban's families don't own cars and 57 percent sold car to move here. Vauban, completed in 2006, growin trend in Europe. Many cars has their own unqiue from other cars which people love and feel for it. Passenger cars are reponsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emission Europe. Vauban, home to 5,500 residents within a rectangular square mile. Almost 4,000 drivers were fined during driving and have been impounded for their action. The end of car culture. Their are a lot of thing happening in car culture happen in technoloy and may improve with cars.  
1123	Not everyone can affored a car and not everyone ownes a car. 
1124	i think that technology is valuable because you can tell when peoples expressions show they have a emotion like when their eyebrows go up their surprised or if their lips tighten up their angry so that's really cool because you can tell when their mad, sad,happy and thats how people can tell someone is having a bad day or just sad over something really bad so 
1125	thats why i agree cause i always wanted to know what people are feeling. 
1126	this evidence i got it from the article saying that thieir having technology where you can tell what people are feeling inside of them or if their mad at you or other stuff so its really cool that they invented this technology cause now people can see peoples emotions and we could never do that.  the whole point of this article is about inventing a technology where everyone can tell what your emotions are and what your body expresses those are your emotions and thats how people know what your are expressing. 
1127	It's interesting to think ahead and create something big that no one can do. 
1128	From the picture of Mona Lisa, when you just look at it, many ideas would pop up in your head from trying to guess how she's feeling and how she looks 
1129	"There would be multiple guesses on how her face looks. In paragraph 6, the author says, ""The Mona Lisa demonstration is really intended to bring a smile to your face, while it shows just how much this computer can do."" Some people might say that she looks mostly happy, a bit disgusted, somewhat fearful, and a little angry. Or they might say all of them and more. We all have different minds, different thoughts, and a different sights at describing a picture. "
1130	"In the first couple paragraphs the author talks about how Venus is sometimes called the ""Evening star"" and how it is the closest planet to earth. "
1131	I personally disagree with you. 
1132	We use cars as a means of travel, others to modify and race, and make them look cool 
1133	Comparison systems that use mechanical parts can be made more resistant to pressure, heat, and other forces 
1134	Exploring venus is dangorus because if NASA is planning someone too venus wouldn't be a good idea is better sending them in a group but sending someone alone is not a good idea 
1135	Venus is the closest planet to Earth terms of density and size and occasionally the closet in distance too. Earth, Venus, and Mars and the other planetary neighbor orbit the sun at different speeds. The differences in speed mean that sometimes we are closer to mars and other times to venus.

1137	This article is talking about the the planetary neighbors of the Earth. on this article explains how others planets move around the sun and the earth,how are thir differences between the speed of this planets. Also explains why the humans never visit this planets, and how are their enviorment. 
1138	"Venus, somethimes called the ""Evenig Star"" is the closest planet to Earth. this planets have differents such as, the size between their, the speed that they move around the sun, this speed mean tht sometimes we are closer to Mars and other times to Venus.  The big question here is, why humans never visited this planets in more l tha three decades. Each previous mission was unmanned, and for good reason, no since no spacecraft survived the landing for more that a few hours. Numerous factors contribute to Venus's reputation as a challenging planet for humans to study, despite its proximity to us.  A thick atmosphere of almost 97% carbon dioxide blankets Venus. On the planet's surface temperatures average oner 800 degrees Fathrenheit and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet. Also notable, Venus has the hottest sufrace temperature of any planet of solar system, wheather present additional impediments like erupting volcanoes, and powerful earthquakes.  The National Aeronautics Space Administration (NASA) has one particulary idea for sending humans to study Venus, Venus would aviod the unfriendly ground conditions by staying up andout of their way, temperatures would still be toasty at around 170 degrees Fahrenheit. No easy conditions, but survivable for humans.  However, Venus can provide only limited insinght on ground conditions because most forms on light cannot penetrate the dense atmosphere. Many researchers are working on innovations that would allow our machines to last long enough to contribute meaningfully to our knowledge of Venus. "
1139	For now humans can't go to explore others planes as Venus, but I think with the step of the time, humans are going to envolving more on their technologies. Something that everyone know clearly, both planets as Mars and Venus have a lot of differences between our planet. Can humans can go to others planes in next close years?  
1140	to imform fellow citizens about the advantage of limited car usage.'' as a result,70 percernt of vaubans families do not own car and 57 percent sold a car to move here''.''Automobiles are the linchpin of suburbs where middle- families from chicago to shanghai tend to make their home''.and '' passenger car are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in europe. and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive area in the united state''. 
1141	while there have been effort in the past two decades to make cities denser, and better for walking, planners are now taking the concept to the suburbs. vauban,home to 5,500 resident within a rectangular square mile,may be the most advanced experiment in low-car suburban life'' 
1142	paris typically has more smog than other european capital.''president obama's ambitious goal to curb the united state greendhouse gas emissiom, unveiled las week,will get a fortuitous 
1143	that what i think advantage of limited car like i said every city and county are different and have different cost.    
1144	Each passage has its own main part about Venus, however, it will tallk about the challenge that are face in Venus 
1145	In this parts of the article the author has the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despiting the dangers and he explains his reasoning with the context that is left behind this article 
1146	" venus is a big planet, sometimes is called ""evening star"", is one of the brightest point of light in the night sky making it simple for even an amateur stargazer to spot. In our solar system, venus is the second planet from our sun. "
1147	 If you think is good if the NASA want search information about Venus, and end venus is a planet with more silmilarity to the Earth, i think is good but with the genocide atmosphere is so hard if we try live on Venus. maybe just how are the atmosphere or search life in other planets but for live on venus is a big problem. 
1148	 just live one day or less, or the human body change or some people born different the others. these conditions are not for a human, the human be killed in seconds.  is a big challenge live is this planet, the temperatures are not for humans the clouds are acid and we don't know if this planet has other lifes. 
1149	If you were to notice a student feeling sad or lonely, you find out the problem and solve it. If a student was mad or upset, you could fix that too. This might create less violence in schools and higher school attendence rates. It could prevent fights and arguements between teachers and students. It could also prevent bullying 
1150	I think that what they are doing is a very constructive way of showing that you can find ways to determine a person's well being and their happiness. This program should be kept going at it's fullest for lots of years and should get to a point where it even helps out the crime system. As a last thought the program has to perfect this to get to maximum use of what should be used to help determine these feelins and emotions for the better. 
1151	There are many reason on why texting while driving is very useful 
1152	We shouldn't just wait and see what happens, we have to do something about it, because we are all human. If we see someone very depress we try to cheel them up, but what if we can't tell. That's also another example when we should use them. We can stop things from happening, bad things. 
1153	"Elisabeth Rosenthal believes it to be ""The End of Car Culture"". What do you believe? Are you happy with the life you are living now? ""Has America passed peak driving?"".       Â     "
1154	These are all reasons he supports the idea that it is fun to study, but also dangerous. I will get more in depth with these reasons. 
1155	A community with less cars has proven to also be one with less healthy citizens. 
1156	By having so many similarities to earth we could later bring life to Venus.  As well as Venus is right next to Earth so there wouldn't be many difficulties. 
1157	Venus is similar to Earth, only in some ways but there are many dangers of going there.  
1158	if they dont want to they shouldnt have to maybe if they like doing student council, sports or working on the schools yearbook then they can. 
1159	if the principle makes the student do an extracurricular activity that the student doesnt like and if there is some other students that actually want to do that activity what ever that might be it might be full of kids already so the kids that actually want to do that activity he or she cant do that now because the class might be full and there is a kid in there that doesnt even want to do the activitty he or she got put in. 
1160	if they even want to be in anything if not then they just dont do any sports, student council or working on the schools yearbook but i definetley dont think that the principle should be able to choose what u do in school just like u get to pick your classes most the time but if they are full then u get other choices. 
1161	"the university of amsterdam, Dr. huang and his colleague are experts at developing better ways for human and copmputers to communicatre. a computer recognize the subtle facial movements we human use to express we feel. the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the the face, all 44 major musclues in the model must move like human muscles.  the new emotion, recognition softwere track these facial movements in a real face or in the painted face of Mona Lisa, the different unit, thte softwere can even identify mixed emotion, each expression is compared against a neutral face showing no emotion. the humans perform this same impressive every day. for instance, we can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face. us would have trouble actually describing each facial trait that conveys happy, worried, that artist such as da vici studied human anatomy to help them paint facial muscles precisely enough to convey specific emotion.  his new computer softwere stores similar anatomical information as electronic code. perharps Dr. huang emotion algorrithmms are different sort of ""Da Vinc code"" the Mona Lisa demonstration is really internded to bring a smile to thet're face, while it shows just how much this computer can do. a computer that knows when they're happy or sad. if they're smile when a web ad appears on they're screen, a simily ad might follow, but if they're frown, the next ad will be different.  a classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored, then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor. the same technology can make conputer animated faces more expressive for video games or video surgery. most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication, note Dr. huang, so computer need to undersatand that tooooo.  had his actor carefully reproduce smiling and frowning as a way of creating these emotion on stage. feeling someone else's emotion state, may happen because they're unconsciously imitate another person's facial expression. whoever thought that making faces could reveal so much about the science of emotion "
1162	Dr. Huang just want people to used the technology about the computer of Making Mona Lisa smile. he want all the wourl people happy of about he did. he just want to see people are smile. he don't want people are sadness. that's why he making these technology. 
1163	What i can also personally add to this parrgraph is things are way more depenable and understanding and way more better and trustfull and when many people join their heads together. 
1164	"Thirdly, another evidence that supports that i am for the value of using this tehnology to read students emotional expressions is in the text where the text states "" The process begin with the computer model of the face .....then Dr. Huang relies on the work of psychologists, such as Dr. paul eckman......for example, your frontalis pars lateralis muscle ......"" . from this evidence i should already know that i am for this technology and i agree with it being used to read students emotional expressions. I agree with it being used to read students emotinal expression, because just from the first four words of the quote i know that is is definently dependable "
1165	I know from those four words in the begining of the quote that this passage tells me everything that i need to know about this technology. It also leaves me without worries and question but the need to use it. 
1166	"Fourth, another evidence that i can use that supports why i am for this the quote ""The software is the latest innovtion from "" just from this quote i can support why i am foe the value of using this technology to read students emotional expressions "
1167	because i no that what ever company or what so ever this project will definently be graet and will as much as it is expected to do great 
1168	"Another reason why i am for the value of using this technology to read students emotional expressions is the text states ""While looking at the mirror :......1....2...3...... does your expression in the mirror suggest an emotion?  Can your lab partner recognize which one........accordig to facial feedback....."". "
1169	from this quote i can say that people can't just understand your emotions and how you feel because of your face expression so that is wy their is a need for a technology that is thrustfull and has been developed with so much knowlege to help with all that and the curiusity of how someone feels from their facial expression. 
1170	The part about being in venus it is 97 percent carbin dixode its more. challenging then are clouds and it live closer to the sum the. the earths does. Venus has the hottest temperature of any planet in the sloar system its hotter than mercury amd mercury is closer to the sum them venus is beyond hight temparture venus have powerful earthquakes it has alot of lighting streaks its seeking to the land. NASA wants to send people to venus to experiance venus. 
1171	Venus is a very challenging place to go in visit Venus because the human ceriosity. 
1172	Your parents or teacher might say say hi and you might mike a new friend that half a lie to me it easier said then done. Now you donÃÂÃÂ´t know how people will react to a samples hi,hello,or sup they might give you a a sink face or a nasty face but having some activity you can make some that like to do the same activity you like to do .yall might makeÂ a brotherhood or a sisterhoodÂ that can happen with this. 
1173	Having theseÂ activity give them time to go home and do what they got to do I know most of those activity ends at five or six and sports ends at seven sometimes. That give to time to make dinner or whatever go home eat do homework go to sleep or chill easy as that. 
1174	because the Face on Mars looks just like a natural face 
1175	The Face on Mars looks just like a natural face. 
1176	"Lastly, this goes for the same as drinking and driving. Any alcohol consumed inside your body will greatly be affected in your driving ability. The Alcohol Rehab Guide claimed that, you'll have a ""slow reaction time, lack of coordination, reduce concentration, decrease vision, and inhibit judgment."" These are ways alcohol influences you, and your driving capabilities. "
1177	BecauseEckman has classified six basic emotions happiness, surprise, anger,disgust, fear, and sadness and then assocaited wach with characteristic movements of the facial muscles. Using video imagery, the new emotion-recognition software tracks these facial movements. In a real face or in printed face. 
1178	At least according to some new computer software you can recognize emotions. The software is the least innovation. 
1179	There are a lot of examples in the text like there is one that talks about your frontalis pars lateralis nuscle which is above your eyes. This is technology is valuable it gives lots of good way you could read or figure out someones expression or feeling. According to the Facial Feedback Theory of Emotion, moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions, but also may even help produce smiling and frowning as a way of creating these emotions on stage, Empathymay happen because we unconsciously imitate another persons facial expressions. Each expression is compared against a neutral face. 
1180	You could argue that the use of the technoloy is valuable cause maybe they used that to make Mona Lisa Smile thats the name the article. So they could've used that as a advantage. 
1181	Some people like to drive while otherss don't 
1182	In paragraph 2 the author states that all the trips to the planet have been unmaned for a good reason the spacecraft didnt last longer than 3 hours thats why it dangerous and hard for us to study the planet. The planet woud be fun to study but almost imposible the temperatures are over 800 degrees fahrenheit that would be imposible for anything to survive on the planet that meaning humans. Venuses atmosphere is also way to dangerous for us to even breath in. 
1183	It could be possible but we will have to wait to find out. 
1184	Have you ever thought of being a Seagoing Cowboy. 
1185	"When being a Seagiong Cowboy ""It made me more aware of people of other countries and their needs."" (from paragraph 9) "
1186	How can a computer just express how humans feel emotions are some you feel when another person tell you that you are speacial, and not by letting a computer tell you. Computers are program to do what you wan them to do and help with things such as homework, research pappers and essays they are a software system bulit to help you with over the site needs.  
1187	Dr. haung and his collegue are experts at developing better ways for humans and computers to communicate. 
1188	We let danger and fear go, and let the power of adventure come through. 
1189	The science of emotions could be a thing of the future, but even more so with the Facial Action Coding System.    
1190	"Many places are trying to make things closer together and easier to get to, to encourage walking over driving, Andrew Selsky mentioned in his article ""Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota."" He also mentioned that ""parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city; uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks..."" So this has caused the people in Bogota, Colombia to love walking no matter the weather.  In the article, ""The End of Car Culture"" by Elisabeth Rosenthal, she mentions that America's love of cars has decreased a lot. She also has stated that ""a study last year found that driving by young people decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009"". People are now car-pulling or walking. Car sales have decreased as well. In some cities like Vauban, Germany have cut car usage all together and are completely car free as mentioned in the article ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On without Cars"" by Elisabeth Rosenthal. "
1191	While it is an intresting idea, it really needs to be utterly perfect in every way or else it could cause many problems. 
1192	"A claim that evalutes how well the author supports the idea is ""Often referred to as Earth's twin, Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size, and occasionally the closest in distance too."" "
1193	""" Sometimes we are closer to Mars and other times to venus."" ""EAch previous mission was unmanned, and for a good reason, since no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours."" ""Not a single spaceship has touched down on Venus in more than three decades."" "" A thick natmosphere of almost 97% carbon dioxide blankets Venus.""  The suface of venus is over 800 degress, that is 90 times greater than what we experience on Earth. These conditions on Venus are far more extreme. Venus conditions also beat submarines divinging into the deepest parts of out oceans. Ir would liquidfy metals. Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar sysem even though Mercury is closer to our sun. Venusian geology and weather presents additional impediments like erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lighting strikes to probes seeking to land on its surface.  Venus was probaly covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth. Venus still has some features just like Earth. The planet has rocky sediment and includes familar features like valleys mountains and craters but, you have to consider given the long time frames of space travel.  Venus would allow scientist to float above the fray. A cehicle hpvering over Venus would avoid the unfriendly ground conditions by staying up and out of the way. You would have to be 30 plus miles above the surface. The temperture will still be hot around 170 degrees. The air pressure would be close to sea level on Earth. ""Radation would not exceed Earths levels."" The conditions on Venus would be survable for humans. "" Most forms of light cannot penetrate the dense atmosphere, rendering sandard forms of photography and videpgraphy ineffective.""  "" Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation."" ""Reaseachers cannot take samples of rock, gas, or anything else from a distance."" "
1194	Reading ones emotions using technologydoesn sound os bad but it also sounds just as badas it seems to be good technology for someone to have for family use, 
1195	Sure, using your mouth muscles revealing emotions is easy, but it can be a bit hard for those with stage fright or insocial status to show emotions around strangers, thats why this inventions is a great thing to me to know and have in the world of mysteries. 
1196	students are already busy with homework 
1197	either way extra curricularsÂ are never as fun when you're told you have to do them. 
1198	Students theseÂ days lack extracurricular activity. Mainly kids focus on their main core classes that only serve in those seven hours of school. 
1199	It is because when students are in bad mood teachers don't understand it so having the technology would help the teachers know that he or she is not in a good mood. Those are the reasons why the technology could do this 
1200	In a real smile the zygomatic major which is the muscles that begin at your cheeks bones that lift the corners of your monuth. In 6 paragraph it said that the computer can determine how you feel. for example if you smile then the web ad appears on your screan and if you frown the next ad will be different. 
1201	In that same paragraph it said that the same technology can make a computer animated faces more expressive for video games or video surgery alos it said that most humans communtication is nonververbal including emotional communication. 
1202	The face wasnt designed by aliens. There isnt any proof that alienseven exsist. 
1203	The face is an illusion, you have to catch it at the right angle because if you catch it at another angle you ont be able to see it. 
1204	You can see that aliens didnt make it because when they took the picture in 1998 you couldnt really see the face, but in 2001 you could see it 3 times better than the first one. When taking pictures you always have to get the right angle because either something gets left out or something dosent shows up. 
1205	If there were any aliens we would have seen them due to the fact that we have spacecrafts taking pictures of it and we have been on the planet ourselves. 
1206	If aliens did make it why are we just noticing it why didnt we notice it the other times. or better than that why havent we seen any aliens working on it. If aliens did do it why is that the only thing they made why havent they made other things why just a face? We all know that aliens dosent exsist so stop saying that until we have evidence that aliens exsist. 
1207	The author has a few reasons of why he thinks this 
1208	One thing that the authro does well to support his idea is he gives a lot of compelling resons of why he thiks venus is worth exploring 
1209	because if this device did not tell the truth every would hate each other. A computer that knows when you're happy or sad is not good for humans. For example, if this Facial Action Coding System could be use in humans kids will not have go to school anymore because they will start doing something else. 
1210	We could detormen if someone daprise and help them or cipadiseing with them 
1211	We could use this tecnogly more then just the classroomn like a better secroty system or a more exsprenol imeag to help doctores of what the pasent is feeling. That this tecnolgyn could work on pc or maby a phone is just mind blowing. 
1212	he says that it is one of the hottest planets even though its not directly next to the sun the pressure holds the heat in, its hot enough to melt certain metals 
1213	Facial Action Coding seems to just identify just your face. A face expression can hid your actual emotion 
1214	Systems like this have the chance to not be right. Make believe what this system is all about. 
1215	At some point a studnets can feel pressered after a class of even before there next class. These emotion have the accursy to not be the same during a students day. Calculating these emotion, can not be like working on a math problem. Emotions can change in the matter of a second. You just dont know what can happen at any minute that changes your expressions. 
1216	Lastly, this system would not be good to keep students emotion 
1217	"As it is stated in the passage Residents of theÂ  upscale communtiy in german hav e given up their cars ""Street parking ,drive ways and home garages are geneally forbiddean in the experimental new district"". Car ownership is allowed but there are only two places that you can park ,large garages at the end of the development(2) ,car owners buy the space for $40000 alone with a home(2).

"
1218	"What the author suggests is something thst is really worthy pusuit the danger is presents because Venus could even become the next ""Earth"" in a near future. "
1219	By doing a Facial Action Coding to a classroom full of students would be different and interesring 
1220	The author say's vanes is the twin of of our solar systame. Venus is the closeist to see from the earth scood planet from the point in life earth . The author talks about that venus is the clostes to the plant to earth in the terms of density and size and occasionaly the clostest distance too. In the texts the author talks about approaches to studinng venuse examples, some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaso of venuse surface and have lasted for three weeks in such conditions. In the text it say's however peering at venus from a ship orbiting or hovering safety far above of the planet can provide only limited insights on the ground conditions becuase most forms of light can not penetrate the dese atmospher. 
1221	 . One thing shows you that studing venus is worth it is that you travel and you will meet the vary edges of imagination and innovation, travels on earth and beyone should not be limited by danger and doubts . 
1222	Technology is used to much in the world. My question is why would we even use that technology, because later on generations won't be able to look at someone and tell their emotions. 
1223	There is also a possibility that we wouldnt have to go completely without cars. We could go to electric or just find a totally different resource to run a car. I am sure there has to be something else than just gas that could run a car. It amazes me how we make all these crazy futuristic inventions but we cant make another substance to run a car. I think we should stop worrying about just stopping car usage completely and try to make something else that will run a car. 
1224	"Well yes i do understand that but if we all got the best brains inn the world together and tr to figure this out i most definitely think we can do it. Maybe we wouldnt have to just get the smartest people to help us, we could get everyone in the world to help us. Some may also ask ""well how do you expect to do that?"" well its simple you have to do the same thing we would to stop smoking SPREAD AWARENESS. Doing this would help a huge amount. "
1225	I think alot of people take the whole no car thing the wrong way, cause lets face it there no way we could go without cars. 
1226	But,then why wouldn't it looks fuler or have actuale face there would be bones. And if there was a statues then why is it only it's head you would a lest find the other parts of the statue but we haven't and that's because it only a land form shaped into something almost everyone beleives to be actuale life. 
1227	from my experience with the Bible it says there is nothing else in the universe to do harm to the earth, except for sin and satin. The Lord thy God will never but something like that in the universe to do us harm. 
1228	Luke has a certain point of view on convincing others to participate in this program 
1229	The awarness stayed with him and thats why he feels this way about other people participating i the program. 
1230	"In the story it states that ""Luke also found time to have fun on board.""  I think this helps his point of view because he is convincing others to go on this fun trip.  The text also states that these fun activities or games helped them pass time.  Luke's point of view might of changed by having fun and thats a part of why he is convincing others to participate.  "
1231	"In the text Luke said ""It opened the world to him.""  The text states that he was grateful for the oppotunity. "
1232	IN A WAY THAT, CAR OWNERSHIP IS ALLOWED,BUT THERE ARE ONLY TWO PLACES TO PARK LARGE GARAGES AT THE EDGE OF THE DEVELOPMENT, WHERE A CAR OWNER BUYS A SPACE FOR $40,000, ALONG WITH A HOME. AND UP TO 50 PERCENT IN SOME CAR- INTENSIVE AREAS IN THE UNITED STATES'' HOW MUCH YOU DRIVE IS AS IMPORTANNT AS WHETHER YOU HAVE HYBRID. WHERE EMISSIONS FROM AN INCREASING NUMBER OF PRIVATE CARS OWNED BY THE BURGEONING MIDDLE CLASS ARE CHOKING CITIES, IN THE UNITED STATES THE ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY IS PROMOTING ''CAR REDUCED'' COMMUNITIES, AND LEGISLATORS ARE STARTING TO ACT IF CAUTIOUSLY.

1233	This how I feel about the Facial Action Coding System. 
1234	"In paragrapgh 5, it says, "" "
1235	"In this world, we want to gain more knowlege to better understand what's around us.  Now, scientists want to be in the next level of understanding. They want to gain more information about the Venus. Venus is also called,""Evening Star.""  They know that it is a very dangerous thing to accomplish. However, they're still doing it anyway. The author even says,""Is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet."" He also said,"" To contribute meaningfully to our knowlege of Venus.""  Scientists study many things, they explore many planets: Such as Moon, Mercury, Saturn, etc. But this, it's beyond what numbers of people to even imagine doing it. "
1236	The author gaves us a way to accomplishes the impossible. It was by not giving up and continues to believes in how we started. 
1237	"Cold nights and warm days caused the warmer layer of air to trap car emissions and desil fuel was blamed. we the people want to stop the pollution and eliminate it once and for all so the People proposed "" A day without cars"". It's part of an improvement campaign that began in Bogota in the mid-1990s. This campaign has seen the construction of 188 miles of nicycle paths, the most of any Latin American city, according to the citys mayor. Parks and sports centers have beeen packed throughout the city, Sidewalks have been redone, rush-hour restrictions have cut traffic, new and more resturaunts have been built, and upscale shopping districts have cropped up.  The end of car culture has hit everywhere and id just getting to the U.S.  President Obama's goal to curb the United states' greenhouse gas emissions, unveiled last week, will get a fortuitous assist from an incipientÂ  shift in American behavior. Recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewwer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by. the essential question is "" Has America passed peak driving?""  the United states had been long one of the worlds prime car cultures. But America's love affair with its vehicles seems to be cooling. when adjusted for population growth, the number of miles driven in the United States peaked in 2005 and dropped steadily after. As of april 2013, the number of miles driven per person was nearly 9 percent below the peak and equal to where the country was in january 1995.  ""different things are converging which suggests that we are witnessing a long-term cultural shift,"" said Mimi Sheller, a sociology professor at Drexel University and director of its Mobilities Research and policy center. She cites various factors about how the internet makes telecommuting possible and allows people to feel more connected without driving to meet your friends. the renewal of centercities has made the suburbs less appealing and has drawn empty nesters back in. The rise in cellphones and car-pooling apps has facilitated more flexable commuting arrangements, inncluding the evolution of shared va services for getting to work.  a study last year found that driving by young peopple decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009 and even car buyers are merely older or buying fewer cars in a lifetime rather than rejecting car culture outright. ""pedestrian, bycycle, private cars, commerical and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emmissions and improve safety.""

1238	Venus is planet not a star it the secound planet of the sun.  Venus is a planet. Venus is often referred as Earth's twin Venus is the closest planet to Earth terms of density and size. Venus is occasionally the closest in distance to Earth. The diffrences of Venus is the speed sometimes we are closer to Mars then Venus because Venus is right around the coner 
1239	Scientists are discussing further visits to its surface. Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because its was once most like planet in our sytem. Venus can probably could been covered by a ocean and could supported various forms of life. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration has been sending people to study Venus. Scientists still discuses about futher visits and NASA has send people to study venus. 
1240	It's just seconds before you realize what's happening, and there's no going back when you cant even see what's coming. It takes little to no effort to put down your phone, and the same amount of effort to stop yourself from picking it up 
1241	In my opinion as a student: I don't agree at this type of method but the same time is good for students and teachers to learnd everyday, life is like a school we never stop learning something everyday and acquire new expirence and skills in our grammer. 
1242	I should go neither everybody need their will to vote what they want to do or spend their summer break as they like. 
1243	like you see is their break and is not fair to obligate a student to do a project with out a vote to give them a choice to pick if they want to do it or not. 
1244	Example; like the elections a President can't be a President with out votes, the country pick their own candidates and the citizens give the vote to the person they pick best for their country  Most likely everything have a vote in our community fuction nothing move with out a vote to people is fair to vote, that how it worksÂ  
1245	"being an avid ""green"" human that is saving the Earth. "
1246	What you can not see is the other emtions such as disgust or fear or angry. So how can the author really say that she is all those things if she. 
1247	What I stated in my paragraph befor was that you may tell somebody that your really close with you feelings but then be smiling or not showing any emtion at all 
1248	In our world today the technolgy is so wonderful it can changes images with the click of a button. 
1249	Mona Lisa, she's 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry. At least according to some new computer software that can recognize emotions. Thomas Huang, the beckman institute for advanced science at the University of Illinois, working in collaboration of the Unversity of Amsterdam and his colleague are experts at developing better way for human and computer to communicate to each person or online. For computer can use homework research to recognize the subtle facial movement the human use to express how they feel about the computer's using in it. The fact, they perform this same impressive for calculation for every day. Most of them would have trouble their issue of describing each facial trait that conveys happy, worried and etc. The Mona Lisa demonstration is really intended to bring a big smile to your face. By the way, making you happy face in this experiment also make you feel slightly happy to your face. Making faces could be reveal so they have a much of the science of emotions. 
1250	If your principal was asking you if you think it's a good idea that students must participate in at least one school activity, what would you say, do you agree or disagree. While reading this pay attention to the details that will be added about why students should or shouldn't must participate in school activities. 
1251	while others think it's a great idea. 
1252	"Im Evan and a guy at my work named John says that the Face on mars was created by alien's. I told him ""Its not created by aliens and me and others at NASA have proof"". He said ""show me the proof than EVAN!!!"". So I then went to get my boss and asked him if i could see the pictures and articles about the face on mars. He said i couldn't see them right away because he needed them so i gad a wait a whole day. The next day my boss handed me the paper and i was so exited to go to John's face and show him the facts. "
1253	Even only a little bit of scientists believe the face was an alien articraft.' 
1254	Encountering the face on mars was not an easy task i told him, and they just don't pass over it very often said Garvin i told him. They even took other pictures where the pixel size was 3 times bigger so if there was other objects like aircraft or pyramids they would be able to see them. 
1255	"Then i asked him ""Now was that enough proof for you to believe me' and he said i'll tell you tomorrow. John went home and did research, when he came back he said ""yes I believe you now."" After that i was like want to be friends and he said Yes. "
1256	if any student wanted to know how the author was feeling at the time and it could also help them with projects 
1257	The author does a pretty nice job at explaining all the dangers of Venus. The author provides the readers with all the information that is necessary, for the space program. Although Venus is dangerous, scientists are still willing to find out about it.  
1258	In the quote just stated, it proves that even if the spacecraft does not last more than a few hours, scientists are spending thousands of dollars on equipment just for some information but not much. 
1259	"In the next quote, some of the features will be listed. ""The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters"" (paragraph 4). Astonomers are working with everything they can at the moment. ""Researchers cannot take samples of rock, gas, or anything else, from a distance. Therefore, scientists seeking to conduct a thorough mission to understand Venus would need to get up close and personal despite the risks"" (paragraph 6). "
1260	The previous quote is stating that scientists are trying no matter what the risks are. Also, scientists cannot completely risk their lives for safety purposes but they do their best. 
1261	Scientists will strive to meet the challenges by Venus. It is believed that information should not be limited but risks should. If none of the scientists took risks for our planet, there would be no information about the past, present, or future. Scientists work and risk the dangers of  Venus. Scientists will do what they have to, to support their claims.       
1262	Teenagers do not understand the meaning of putting your phone down. 
1263	If so many teenagers would just pay attention to what's going on around them they would understand what's going on in the world. 
1264	Teenagers and even adults could care less about the people around them on the road and that is not how it should be. 
1265	because if Venus is so close to the sun it and is one of the hottest planest because is close to the sun, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various form of life just like the Earth. 
1266	"Venus is similar like the earth they have valleys,mountains,and craters. But we don't know if they have food. they mayhave alliens because of the tempertures. And it can be dangerous to the Earth because we are the closest one to Venus.  scientists seeking to conduct a thorough mission to understand venus would need to get up close and personal despite the risks or maybe we should think of them as challenges. Many researchers are working on innovations that would allow our machines to last long enough to contibute meaningfully to our knowledges of venus.  NASA has the power and money to send people and invest about all these things.  NASA has one particulary compelling idea for sending humans to study Venus.  NASA's posssible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to flot above the roiling Venusian landscape.  Or maybe Venus is just a start because of his nickname and is one of the brightest points of light in the night sky.  Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system,even though Mercury is closer to oour sun.  Beyond high pressure and heat, Venusian geology and weather present addicional impediments like erupting volcanoes,powerful earthquakes,and frequent ligtning strikes to probes seeeking to land on its surface.  NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientist to flot above the fray.  Venus i the closet planet to the Earth in term of density and size and occasionally the closest in distance to. Should be more easy to study but the value of returning to Venus seems indisputable, but what are the options for making such a mission.  we should invest if in Venus exist phone or tablet or system that use mechanical parts can be made more resistant to pressure,heat,and other forces.  we all have questions like ""if Venus move around just like the Earth does"".  We all want to konw ""if Venus produce live"".  we should keep invest why not a single spaceship has touched down on Venus  The temperature that Venus has is too hot for humans is more extreme that anything and the weather present additional impediments like erupting volcans.  Why venus still has some features that are analogous to those on Earth. "
1267	Venus the evening star since its the brightest point of light in the night sky. Humans have sent numerous spacecraft to land on this cloud-draped world and each missiion was unmanned since no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours and nvere touched venus in more than tree decades. The thick atmosphere is almost 97 percent carbon dioxide and the clouds are even more challenging since their is highly corrosive sulfuric acid in venus's atmosphere and on the planet surface temperatures average is over 800 degrees fahrenheit and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than we experience on earth and the environment would crush even a submarine. Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported forms of life and has familiar features suah as valleys, mountains, and craters 
1268	In conclusion if we could possibly bulid something to survive venus we could find some amazing things like if it ever ahad water and find maybe remains of past forms of life. 
1269	Summer projects are seen as a way to make sure that students are learning. These summer projects are usually teacher-designed. 
1270	The shifts of car business in America have gotten car dealerships to worry about how many people are buying cars from dealerships due to the fact there's hybrid vehicles coming out whichÂ  lowers the use of gas and pollution on most vehicles such as the prius. There has been studies to show that young people that drive have decreased by Twenty three percent. Also another reason is that kids are able to carpool with friends or take local transport such as buses or taxis which limit the needs for a car.       Â      
1271	My down time was not the most important part of the trip though. 
1272	Opponents say that cell phones are good because they give an opportunity to make a call in case of emergency. 
1273	what we could do is replace gas cars with water or oil solarpowered cars. what we can do is replace the road with heat sensor pannels and replace the cars fuel line with eigther a solar based power syatem or used water for the fuel supply. 
1274	the heat/friction sensor pannels will produce enough electrical energy to power builds, appartment complexs, houses, or even recharge a battery with in seconds.  the way we live now we can do all those things its just people dont know how to use there brain and come up a cleaner source of renewable energy. this entire project could be free and go world wide as long as everyone in the world can a agree this is perfect replacement to fossil fuels. if this document could get the th government somehow ican change the world for the better and probably save our poluted earth from destroying its self. i could fix the green house eeftect on the earth and you could clean up radio active polution by not useing gas powered cars. our erath could go back to a clean slat where there is no polution made by toxic fumes in the atmosphere and destroyed rivers and lakes. everything could be fixed by one simple thought of a childs mind. if only adults knew how to listen to there own words that they teach us with how to listen twice as muchas they speak. ifthis country has the right to freedom of speech then i think my idea isworth telling the world about. and not keeping my mouth shut. i should be speaking on air to the world not in my house being yeld at by my parents becuase what i want to nobody wants to hear. if anyone gets to read this please immediatly take to someone important that would love to here my idea. thank you.    
1275	If we limit the use of cars 
1276	"Some are asking questions like "" Can we actually calculate emotions?"" or "" How can a computer recognize the subtle facial movements we humans use to express our emotions?"" I as of the rest of the curious world would want to see how this new technolgy works. Dr. Huang and Dr. Paul Eckman are working to make this to only bring smiles to someones face each day as shown is paragraph six. Dr. Huang believes that students doing homwork on a computer usually become more bored while doing something boring on a computer, so Dr. Huang and Dr. Paul Eckman want to have a computer know about your feelings like people do. "
1277	so lets put this new computer technolgy to work and lets put it on every school computer. 
1278	Another thing that the author toched on is that Venus nickname The Evening Star 
1279	the writter put that piece of info about Venus becuase he is explaing how Venus is one of the brightest points of light in the night sky which makes it simple for anyone to spot even a simple stargazer. 
1280	Venus is a interesting planet cause of its Evening star which it a bright light and is a second planet of the sun when you look at Venus the density , size and distance gets the attention till where you want to discover the parts and ideas of it. the diferences about a spacecraft is that people wanted spacecraft to land on earth but it didn't work due to no survival that couldn't land more than a few hours thats why this planet is challenging for humans to study the reputations want people to be confused and get the meaning of this. Atmosphere is thick 97 percent carbon dioxide so temperatures goes up 800 degrees F and on earth the atomsphere is 90 times greater.  Sister Planet and Venus are the same thing its the better planet in the solar system which used to be covered in oceans and could supported peoples life just like the Earth. its rocky sediment and has features which are valleys, mountains, and craters.  NASA is working on venus the samples of rock, gas etc. are not working to take the samples its rough so a scienctist knows thay venus needs to be close to do their own vperonsal depsite risk for it to last. NASA working to get other people to study this and have advice. 
1281	I'll tell you reasons why you shouldn't use your phone while driving. Then, I'll explain to you what can happen to you if you use your phone while driving a vehicle. Afterward, I'll tell you the kinds of consequence you can receive from the situation. Finally, I'll give you examples of why it's a bad idea of using your phone while driving. 
1282	The aouthor idea might sound or be a little bit carzy. The author however is not wrong, 
1283	Maybe one day it will be like earth again. 
1284	"Then on how the author likes the ideas that NASA is coming up with to visit earth with what he/she said was a ""compelling idea"" and the machines and devices that their making that the author likes as well "
1285	Schools should not even try to afford this technology it will be really expensive. 
1286	Summer is a time that both students and teachers tend to enjoy. It gives the students a chance to relax, and not worry about things such as homework, projects, quizzes, and tests. The teachers also get a chance to take a break from grading and assigning work. 
1287	"becuase the atmosphere is almost 07persent carbon dioxide. Venu is a very hot place.""On the planet;s surface, temperature average over 800 degrees fahrenheit and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than we ecperience.""On Venu's the condition are far more ectreme than anything us humans have encounter on earth . "
1288	"As the student reads in the passage its say that ""Venus has the hottest surface temperatur of any planet in our solar system "". Many of the people reading this think that it is hot on earth but what we dont relize is that Venus is ver hot. Many of the people in the world think that Mercury would be the hottest because it is closer to the sun . "
1289	Imagine your principal creating an extra curricular activity assignment that you have to choose whether to be in a sport, yearbook comitee, or student council. 
1290	TO THE FELLOW CITIZENS OUT THERE WE ARE LIMITING CAR'S BECAUES PEOPLE DONT LIKE TO PAY THERE CAR, BECAUES THEY EIGTHER DONT HAVE THE MONEY FOR IT OR THEY JUST DONT WANNA PAY IT.. PEOPLE ALL AROUND THE COUNTRY DONT LIEK AYING THER CADR THATS WHY PEOPLES CAR GET TODE BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE LAZY..WHEN A CHILD HAS A SOCCER GAME TO GO TO WHAT WOULD YOU DO IF YOU DONT HAVE A CAR TO GET THERE ?OYU PROBABLY DO EVERYTHING YOU CANTO GET THERE TO SUPPORT YOUR CHILD... 
1291	"IN GERMAN LIFE GOES WITHOUT CARS.. IN EVERY STATE PEOPLES CAR GET TODE FOR NOT DOING WHAT THEY NEED TO DO FOR THEE CAR..AS A RESULT, 60 PERCENT OF PEOPLE DONT OWN A CAR AND 42 PERCENT OF PEOPLE SOLD THERE CAR TO MOVE IN A DIFFERENT HOME..WHEN SOME PEOPLE HAVE CARS THEY LOVE TO GO DO WHAT THEY LIKE O DO TO HAVE FUN.WHEN KIDS HAVE BICYCLES MAKE SURE YOUR OUTSIDE WITH THEM BE YOU WOULDNT WANT THEM TO GET HIT BY A CAR OR YOU DONT WANT THEM TO GET HURT.. IN THE UNITED STATES THE ENVIRMOENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY IS PROMOTING ""CAR REDUCED "" COMMUNITIES ,AND LEGISLATORS ARE STARTING TO ACT, IF CAUTIOSLY..  PARIS BANS DRIVING DUE TO SMOG..ALOT OF PEOPLES GET FINES FOR NOT PAYING THERE TICKETS OR THEY DO STUFF THAT THEY SHOULDNT BE DOING..LIKE 4,000 DRIVERS WERE FINESAND TWENTY SEVEN PEOPLE HAD THEIR CARS IMPOUNDED FOR THEIR REACTION TO THE FINES..

PEOPLE DONT NEED TO COMPLAIN ABOUT NOTHING BECUAES PEOPLE LIKE TO DO THINGS THEY SHOULDNT DO . DONT DO STUPID THINGS AND MAYBE YOU WOULD HAVE A CAR .. "
1292	THEY COULD WALK RIDE A BIKES OR DO SOMETHING .. PEOPLE WHO DONE HAVE LICENSE NEED TO NOT DRIVE BECAUSE THEY CAN GET INTO BIG TROUBLE AND THEY WOULD GO TO JAIL FOR IT ..    
1293	In the story Luke's friend played a big role in him becoming a seagoing cowboy, because he invitied him to go to Europe with him. If his friend didn't invite him Luke would not be know. Thats the reason his friend played a big role  On luke's adventurs he travled to alot of places that were left in ruins from World War II.he wold bring cattle from farms hence the name seagoing cowboys. He went to New Orleans,Greece,Europe,China,Venice,and Italy and helped them recover from the war.  When him and the crew would have to go somewhere to pass the time they would play baseball,volleyball,ping pong,fencing,boxing,reading,and whittling. On luke's second trip he was a night watchman, he would check on the animals every hour. On one rainy night after he made his hourly report to the captian he was going down a ladder and sliped then fell on his back causing him not able to work for a couple of days because he craked his ribs. 
1294	to my point of view as a student i woldnt like if s computure would look at me nd say oh shes feeling happy. because computers does not have a soul do when i hear that they should have computures to se if they can read emotions well i think thats is redundunt. 
1295	but they also say what if they become evil and they go against us and take over the world and kill us all. i think that if they ever make robots and that were to happen then it was all planned because this bings me back to my point. robots dont have souls which means that they cant procces haterate in them. unless they were programed to feel hate but they are sensative so if they actually learn how scientist wants them to learn then i believe that they still wouldnt take over the world unless they were programed to. 
1296	i think that if a student actually thinks that it would be nice to have the computure read your emotions and you could talk to it and stuff 
1297	then i feel lik that would seperte our world even moe ut this time is seperate from eachother from our closest friends and family because they would become our friends and they will become our family. i think if you want to end bulling and family problems etc. then is still not a good idea. like i said this still leads to segragation within ourseleves 
1298	Nine times out of ten children will get bad habits from not adding an extracurricular activity to their schedule.  Causing them to be lazy and end up with bad grades. 
1299	But student will need this when they have nothing else to do or when they have bad grades and they need help. 
1300	I personally don't like the summer assignments teachers give us because they require the whole summer to do. Kids like me want to have fun, not stay at home and read a book all day. 
1301	A few days later NASA unveiled it for all to see. Now few scientist think their is an alien artifact, but they are wrong. 
1302	As soon as word got out on April 5th 1998 when Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time.  They snaped a picture ten times sharper than the originak viking photo . Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting for the JPL website to show the picture scientist revealed the picture as a natural landform there was no alien monument after all , stated in paragraph 7 . 
1303	Venus is the second planet from the sun and the closest planet to Earth, in terms of density and size. 
1304	Teens are only supposed to be on the devices a certain amount of time and this goes for teens and adult that drive.  
1305	Also you can get in a car accident by having a lot of people in the car and loud music those are called distractions and then on top of that, that's like the quicks way to get a ticket. 
1306	Cars, they help us get from point A to B in a shorter amount of time, but at what cost. 
1307	If you are taking all of this for people to have it on a computer software then you are no better than hispanics or immagrants taking people jobs because it'll lessen the chance of people even knowing or wanting to become in their life. 
1308	These photos were taken in 1976, 1998, and in 2001. People thought that the formations were from other living things that are on Mars. Nasa took several pictures of these rock formations because they were shaped like humans. The rock formations starred in a Hollywood film, appeared in books, magazines, radio talk shows and even ended up in haunted grocery store checkot lines for 25 years. 
1309	If there are no more of the planets then we could go to Venus, but we should explore others first to see if they are more suitable for people to live on. 
1310	So this computer can be also useful to see what people from the past felt during those time to see if they had any emotions or did they not. 
1311	In my conclusion emotion can be easy to find threw high tech software but we as human can see the person emotions to but the only differents is that we see the main picture and not the littlest one's. 
1312	Others might look the other way and think the opposite. 
1313	However, Luke said that it was a once in a lifetime expirience 
1314	Also, in the text it said that Luke got to see the Panama Canal. These details prove that maybe you'll get to see a lot more if you become a Seagoing Cowboy. 
1315	Some people think that you could get hurt yourself then who whould help you? 
1316	The principal can decide a lot of things, but not decide what a student does before or after school 
1317	First issue is, it extends an already drawn out school day, making the day last an extra hour or two 
1318	Also, a student's talent may not represented in a club, therefore making them feel left out 
1319	could make students feel left out because their talent isn't represented 
1320	Another cars is a bad idea is because of its gas. 
1321	By then we would be used to it so even bring the cars back that right there would keep making are air clean. 
1322	The author believes them because they have such good outcmomes of the new findings 
1323	"As the author talks about in paragaph 8 it says,""Been tested in a chamber simulation the chaos of Venus. "" This meaning to this is how many things had been tested and seen. Therefore they are dicovering new stuff in this century "
1324	This is explaining how the person doesnt liked the job or does. They are passionate able the stuff they do. As they look into more of Venus, the more excitement is shown and shared. 
1325	So this is why I think this technology to read emotional expressions of students inside the classroom. 
1326	Just becuase the face is in movies and magazines do not make it true their is lots of story in magzines that is not true.  
1327	Limiting car usage will help individuals carry themselves in their environment 
1328	council is a video game 
1329	"In paragraph 3 It states that,"" A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus."" Third of all, it has higher carbon dioxide, so it is helpful for us. Last of all, Venus might be useful to us someday in the future. "
1330	Its like the man it the moon it is just a landscape it is nothing big at all. By saying that it is an alien people today would probally believe that it is true they would go crazy. 
1331	So as far as we know their are no such thing as aliens. On Mars there might be pictures or thing that looklike an alien but its not it a fairytale our mind thinks it saw one but you never did. As i was saying there is no lifeform on mars, 
1332	"Some students want there emtions to them selfs and want to know there emitons. ''She's 82 percent happy. 9 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry."" This new technology can calculate your emtions like math. Also using ''video imagery, the new emtion-recognition software tracks these facial movments - in a real face or in the painrted face of Mona Lisa.'' It can define the emotion of a real human and in a painting. There technology is very intresting they construct a 3-D computer model to the face. instead of humans trying to find out calculations them selfs they can use the new technology. Humans can perform the same way as the new technology even tho they are gonna have to estimate the percentigs "
1333	"""You can tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face. Of course most of us would have trouble actually describing each facial trait.""  "
1334	There are some students that would enjoy extracurricular activities, and some students that will despise it. Some students might like different activities then the other, but would extracurricular activities really benefit the students lifestyle? 
1335	The question remains, what are the advantages of limiting car usage? 
1336	So when they saw it had all the stuff they whent back to se it again whe the misioon was over for the viking 1 and viking 2 
1337	So when that hapend every one was bumed because they thought that they had actully found live in a nother planet called the red planet.  So everyone was happie because they actully thought they found live in mars but the dint. After that they just left the mission stuff were they were because they were sad because there was no live they just left every thing were it was. 
1338	After all that hapend the whole story was about the face and mars and if there was live.        
1339	Majority of the states have made laws to try to ensure the safety of americans. 
1340	In 1998, Mars Global Surveyor flew over the face, but they revealed there was no face to be seen. There was only a natural landform. Scientists have began to lose hope of ever seeing the face again. If they were ever able to find the face again, they would have money to do more investigation. Although there were no extratrrestrial beings, people still believed the face would soon appear again. Scientists are still trying to look for ways to explain it all. 
1341	"Reasearchers are still looking for the face on Mars. Scientist Jim Garvin states, ""So, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes an the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were !"" "
1342	He is comparing airplanes, pyramids,and small shacks to the face which is no longer there. This statement proves that the face is a natural landform. 
1343	Many landforms on Earth form then after years or even decades, they decay down to nothing. 
1344	Although landforms are always forming, they are also being destroyed. Without oxygen on Mars, there is no way the face is able to survive.  
1345	Not everyone has cars or uses cars for that matter. 
1346	In Vauban, Germany residents given up their cars to walk the streets. Where we generally park in like parking lots, parking garages, street parking, home driveways, and home garages are all forbidden. In Vauban their streets are completely car-free. They do allowed cars there but some people just want to walk to safe their community. But if you have are car you can only park in two places. Those two places are your house, and large garages at the edge of the development. I would never give up my car to live in Vauban, Germany. In matter of fact 57% of people have sold their cars to live there. To believe or not 70% of Vaubans families do not own cars. To me its hard to think that people actually walk everywhere they go. 
1347	Paris bans driving to clean the air of the global city because of pollution. Due to the ban of driving people who are caught driving will be fined 22-euro which is $31 in america. France has a tax policy that favors diesel over gasoline. Its hard to believe that diesels make up 67% of France, compared to 53.3% of average diesel engines in the rest of Western Europe. The smog cleared enough that French part rescind to ban odd numbered plates on Tuesday. 
1348	"Today Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less, and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by. President Obama's ambitious goals to curb the United States' greenhouse gas emissions. This thing has left people like researchers woundering a fundamental question "" Has America pass peak driving?"" As of April 2013, the number of miles driven per person was neraly 9% below the peak and equal to where the country was in January 1995. "
1349	"Unfortunatley, in German Suburbs life goes on without cars. The Vauban's streets are completely ""car-free"" so the article says. They say car owner ship is allowed but there are only two places to park, large garages but that would take up to $40,000. Also, along with a home. 70% of people in the Vaubans family believe that life is better with out cars, of course they do not own cars. 57% sold a car to move here. In 2006 there was a growing trend in Europe, The United States, and else where to seperate suburban life from auto use. They call this ""Smart Planning"" Passanger cars are responsible for 12 percent of the greenhouse gas emissions in Europe, and up to 50 percent in car-intensive areas in the United States.  Vauban. Home to 5,500 people within a rectaugular square mile, may be the most experimented place with low-car suburban life. Levittown and Scarsdale, New York suburbs spread-out homes and private places (such as garages, homes, etc) They were the dream towns of 1950s and still and exert a stong appeal. But some new suburbs look like the Vaubans. Not only in developed countries but also in the developing world. The United States, the Enviornmental Protection Agency is promoting ""car reduced"" communties. Meaning the lack of usage with cars. In previous bills, 80 percent or appropriations have by law gone to highways and only 20 percent go towards other transport. On Monday, motorists were ordered to leave there cars ar home or suffer a fine of $31. Amost 4,000 drivers were fined according to reuters. 27 people had their cars impounded for their reaction to the fine. Down 60 percent Congestion in the capital of France, after five days of intensifying smog. Dieasel fuel was blamed. They make up 67 percent of vehicles in France compared to 53.3 percent average of diesel engines in Western Europe.  The days without cars started in Bogota in the mid-1990s. President Obama's goals to curb the United States greenhouse gas emissions unvieled last week. The United States peaked in 2005 and dropped steadily after. As of April 2013, the number of miles driven per person was nearly 9 percent below the peak and equal to the countrys rate in January 1995. Americans can not afford new cars and the unemployed wern't going to work anyway. The next few years will be telling. "

1352	Albert Einstein is known as one of the smartest people in the world. He created a robot, Frankenstein. Einstein blocked out others, used his own knowledge, got creative, and made history on his own. Helen Keller was born with the default of not being able to hear or to see. This was a tragedy, making it hard for Keller to walk and successfully know where she was going. Growing up with this issue she became extremely smart and used her problem, got creative, and began helping others by tutoring people who are deaf and blind. If students created their own projects it would give them an opportunity to come up with something incredible using what they, causing them to be creative, and generate ideas 
1353	Nobody know how the face got on mars because we never been their. This face could of been their from the jump and ya'll said it was a human face i never seen a face of a human shaped like that a day in my life. You see how the earth changed dont you think ohther plantes form in other shapes like i said people we have no evidence that an alien shaped this face on mars. How we know NASA didnt do this? they can do every thing eles like having a little car drive around on mars and see whats all their and bring littel rocks back from mras. People we got to understand that they is just trying to get our MONEY out of us why you think strang things come out of no were and then they put it on the web. Thats why they make us think stuff is out their like this how you know they didnt just make something that can carve this face on mars an now they trying to say it was aliens that did this. You got to think outside the box people dont let these people trick you for your money because the more attention you give them the more money you give them so please people open your eyes. 
1354	Luke wants to be a segoing cowboy because he likes to travel the seas and he also likes to be a cowboy. Another reason is because he wants to have fun as a cowboy and he really wants to go travel the seas. He wants to have fun because he never has fun at his house so that is why he wants to have some fun. His house is probably boring so that is also why he wants to go outside and have some fun at the program because he wants to get out of his house and have fun. He wants to go outside and do the program so he can be a cowboy and have fun.

1358	so i this system have benfitie and bay way just lets we hao to use it 
1359	Making mona lisa smile agian was the main topic detail in the story. For one reason it would have to be when they painted a picture of her for acomplishing the process of the model of a great model she smiled for that picture. So that is why that gave her own picture of herself and the computer model picture is a little bit better than the orignal one. The computer model has better details in the picture and it also tightens her lips for the picture. More reason is that they express the emotion of her picture in paragraph 2. In paragraph 7 the experts for the picture tell Mona Lisa how to pose for the picture in the first sentence. Paragraph 8 explains Mona being truthful and smiling in the last sentence. Inside Paragraph 4 it is telling about how the expression of the real face is inside the art of Mona Lisa.

1368	Science could be where we can possibly find advances and great inventions for the future 
1369	Now in days a machines can tell you how exactly you feel!. We are humans, but technology could change how we think, how we act and high chances how we live 
1370	""" The authors reasoned it would be a good way to engage the public and attract attention to Mars. The ""Face on Mars"" has since become a pop icon. It has starred in a Hollywood film, appeared in books, magazines, radio talk shows, even haunted grocery store chechout lines for 25 years! But not everyone was satisfied.  The Face on Mars is located as 41 degrees north martian latitude where it was winter in April '98, a cloudy time of year on the Red Planet. Mission controllers prepared to look again. ""It's not easy to target Cydonia,"" says Garvin. ""In fac, it's hard work.  "" Mars Global Surveyor is mapping spacecraft that normally looks straight down and scans the planet like a fax machine in narrow 2.5 km-wide strips. ""We just don't pass over the Face very often,"" he noted.  What the picture actually shows in the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa-landforms common aroud the America West. ""It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River PLain of Idaho,"" says Garvin.  ""That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same heigh as the Face on Mars."" "
1371	First, I would like to say that this is a really good topic the author brings forth to the table, 
1372	Lastly, I would like to say that this point of view that the author is taking is a very good start, 
1373	Or some where there was life on that planet and they died right there where the surface rose up andnformed its face 
1374	When they unveiled the image for all to see the caption noted a huge rock formation thee author thought it was a good way to attract attention to mars it certainly did. 
1375	But before they could see the face they had to go thorght wispy clouds and they had to wait for winter to be over. But after all that on a cloudless summer day they finally got to see the face. 
1376	If people want evidence of aliens or other creatures, they will have to do research on their spare time because scientists have a job to do and they will only do what they are ordered to do

1378	Venus will be a great planet to live on. Imagine if you could have a house on earth and one on Venus. 
1379	Venus was probably coverd with large oceans and could have supported varrious forms of life just like earth. Venus still has some features that are similer to earth. Temperatures would still be very warm at 170 degrees fahrenneit, but the air pressure would be close to that of sea level on Earth. Radiation would not exceed Earth levels but survivable for humans. Old techtology called mechanical computers were first envisoned in the 1800 and played in 1940s during world war 2. It make calculations by using gears and levers and dont require electronic at all. Which on venus it will be some time intell electronic will be there 
1380	When Luke and Don were traveling over seas in the Seagoing Cowboys,They got their seaman's papers and boarded the SS Charles W. Wooster, Headed for Greece. The cargo was 335 horses and enough oats to feed all the horses.  Before arrivingt in Greece,Luke turned 18, Which back then meant that Luke could be drafted for military service.  A couple years later he was discharged,Luke had made nine trips,The most of any Seagoing Cowboy ever. The cattle boat trips were an unbelieveable experience for Luke being a small town boy. Before helping anyone he had the benefit of seeing Europe and China. But Luke also got to see the Acropolis in Greece and taking a gondola ride in Venice,Itlay.  Luke also toured at the evacuated castle in Crete and marveled at the Panama Canal on his way to China. It took two weeks to cross the Atlantic Ocean from the eastern United States and a month to China.  Caring for the animals during the crossings kept Luke busy. They had to eat and give the animals water three times a day. Bales of hay and oats had to be pulled from the lower ship. The stalls had to be cleaned.

1384	The Face is on Mars, which could be an alien. 
1385	People have always thought that there were aliens on Mars. This time there actually could be one on Mars. Life on Mars could be a real thing. Mars is a eird place because it is red, unlike Earth which is mostly blue and green. 
1386	"Luke bomberger was just a normal high school graduate, Until his friend Don Reist asked him to go with him to Europe on a cattle boat. He was just given the opportunity of a lifetime. Luke and his friend Don had reasons to sign up for being a "" Seagoing cowboy"". World war II had now ended and many countries were left destroyed, to help the countries recover from war they will need things such as food, animals, and many other things. To help the people in those countries 44 nations united to form a group called UNRRA ( the united nations relief and rehabilitation administration). The "" Seagoing Cowboys"" were hired to take care of the horses, young cows, and mules that were shipped over seas. In August 1945, they got orders to report to New Orleans. Luke and his friend arrived on August 14th, the same day the Pacific war ended. There was 335 horses to take care of. Before arriving in Greece Luke turned 18, which means that he is now eligable to be drafted for the military service. In 1947 Luke had made nine trips, more than any seagoing cowboy. Luke ended up touring many places around the world. Luke was doing his job chcking on the animals, but this time was different it was raining, Luke accidentally slid down a ladder and almost fell into the deep dark ocean but a piece of metal stopped him fromm falling. Luke was lucky to be alive but he still was injured with some cracked ribs. Although it wasn't always fun, Luke found things to do like baseball, volleyball, tennis, and many more things "
1387	Luke had an amazing adventure being a Seagoing Cowboy, he discovered the world and was given a once in a lifetime opportunity. 
1388	Dr. Huang is really smart but I think he is right. 
1389	"Acoording the text "" can we actually ""calculate""emotions like math homework"",I think they got the right point because our emotional is like calculate. They have to calculate are we really sad or happy. Another example from the text"" The Mona lisa demonstration is really intended to bring a smile to your face, while it shows just how much this computer can do"". I Hope our school should do like that so people we could help other people whenever we are sad. "
1390	Second,these day a lot of people they are lying to another people to much. 
1391	"Honestly, I used to cheat on my girlfriend too back in the day but the good part is that we don't know facial action yet. If we both know that time I bet she will say"" let do this because I want If you are cheating on me"". Still right now she don't know that I cheat on her but we are already broke tho. I saw on social media a lot Boyfriend and girlfriend did that. When they know they both got cheating,both of them feel wierd. People is really good at hide thing I hope we are did Facial Action so we could know how is lying or nah. "
1392	"Finally,I think Dr huang is really smart doing those kind of thing."" "
1393	"The software is the latest innovation from prof,Thomas Huang if the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science at the University OF  lllinois.""Some day I want be like him,He is my idol from now. Also If someone ask me who would I want to meet right now,I would say"" I want to meet with Dr. Huang"". "
1394	Conclusion,every year different technology is coming out,I can't Imagine what is going be like in 20 year later. What kind of technology would be going out. 
1395	That is why i think that we should emplement this new technology into our school systems. 
1396	Hey,how are you today. 
1397	the UNRRA hired''Seagoing Cowboys'' to take care of the horses,young cows,and mules that were shipped overseas. 
1398	No, FACE is not created by aliens. as a person who works for nasa face is not created by aliens 
1399	if you look at the pictures you can find that the imagae is getting clearer and clearer. 
1400	Scientists still held onto their beliefs and avoided correction by a few simple facts. 
1401	This attracted the publics attention and it became a huge pop icon that appeared in books,magazinse,radio talk shows,and even in grocery store isles for Twenty-Five years. 
1402	Dont get me wrong though . Its quiet an amazing work for actresses that are willing to improve their acting skills; It has quiet pontiental that they invented a 3-D computer to identify mixed emotions. 
1403	Lets say someone is being asked a couple questions, if they asked the person if he broke into a house recently they can tell if his stress levels are high. 
1404	In conclusion, all the information the author of this passage provided me with gave me a better understanding on whether or not it's worth it to continue trying to discover more about this similar planet to Earth 
1405	The advantages of limiting car usage 
1406	The challenge of exploring venus is so one knows what is there. Pluse no one knows anything about it soneone would have to go. Then agian it would take forver to get there and there whould be no air maybe bc its in space. 
1407	See no ones ever visited venus be it is far away and no one has done reserch on it to see if theres liveing things on there or not so someoe whould have to do that. Then someone would have to go up there maybe put a drone or rover on it drive it around and see. Then someone would have to go back up there and get the rover then look at the video to see if anythings there. Then we would have to see if theres air on this planet so maybe one day humans can live on a differnt planet.  
1408	That is why we don'go to venus yet because then we would have to built better rockets. Then we would have to get astronut food and make sure they have air helment just in case. Maybe some jet packs just in case. they get stuck and cant find a way back. 
1409	This would also be a fun and creative program because you get to do cool thing like watch dolphins and fish and all of the other sea creatures swim. 
1410	"In parargraph 1 it talks about about of Venues is sometimes called the ""Evening Star"" and it is one of the most brightest points of light in the night sky. It is also known as Earth's twin because Venus is closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size. It says in paragraph 2 "" Each perious mission was unmanned, and for good reason, since no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours."" A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus. "
1411	Long hours of your eyes being exposed to the screen could lead to temporary loss of sight witch is never good. Also, headaches occur when most people are on the phone to much long hours often affect the ears witch leads to more problems occurring then normal. Scientist have shown that the more time we spend on our phones the more time are bodies are being affected. Things like slouching or leaning could lead to permit neck issues and back sprains. 
1412	In conclusion, these are the factors that have lead up to phones on the road being a huge mistake. 
1413	One reason is, Venus is a sister planet to Earth but we don't know alot about it so we need to go there 
1414	Venus is the second plant from the sun. People always called it the evening star because it is one of the brightest points of the ligth fromm the night sky when its dark, but the nickname was misleading because Venus was a plant. Venus migth be simple to see from the distant but safe vantage point of Earth, it has proved to be an veery challenging place to see much closer. 
1415	One thing about Venus that it is the closer to Earth in way like the density and size and sometimes occasionally up close in distance too. Earth, Venus, and Mars, these three plants are like right next to each other like they are friends or neighbors and other plants orbit the sun in a different type of speeds. The differences in speed is that, we sometimes closer to Mars and sometimes its Venus. Its like play musical chair, but the three plants goes in different speeds then each other. So, since Venus is sometimes right around the corner in space, humans have to sent numerous of spacecraft to the land on to Earth.  Each pervious mission was a failed mission because no spacecrafts survived the landing, not even a few hours. And, its because a thick atmosphere that was a big atmosphere of amost 97 percent carbo dioxide blankets Venus. What's even more of a challenge are the clonds of the highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere that maade the temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what they experience on Earth. 
1416	In conclucion, I think what the author study was good fact about the plant Venus. 
1417	Reisdents of VAUBAN that are car owners are allowed to park in two places in a large garage. alos at the edge of the development, where a car-owner buys a space, for $40,000, along with a home. some of the citizens where not to happy about the plan of having no car almost 4,000 drivers were fined, according to reuters 27 people had their cars impounded for their reaction to the fine.  At the Mobile World conress last year in Barcelona, Spain, Bill Ford, executive chir man of the Ford Motor Company, laid out a bsiness plan for a world in which personal vehicle ownership is impractical or undesirable. he proposed partnering with the telecommunications inustry to create cities in which pedestian, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportaion traffic are woven into a cconneted network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and improve safety.  Levittown and Scarsdale, Newy York suburbs with spread-out homes and private garages, were the dream towns of thw 1950s and still exert a strong appeal. But some new suburbs may well look more Vauban-like, not only in developed countries but also in the developing world, where emissions from an increasing number of private cars owned by the burgeoning middle class are choking cities.   
1418	The best way to put this is that anything is posiblie you just have to do it, 
1419	Because in the article it says ''Moving you facial muscles not only expresses emotions but also may even help prduce them put on a happy face. I alsways thought that mona lisa was just happy in a picture but never in my mind did i thing that she was much more than just happy. The best is yet to come and we will not be worried about the stuff that happens becasue of their emotions because the Facial Action Coding System will get us covered.  
1420	A theory and technology such as emotions and the emotional state of someone should be based off of science instead of being based off opinion 
1421	Take a minute and compare this new piece of technology to a quiz given on the internet to see what celebrity I would be. Moral of the story if the person can fake it, they can make it. 
1422	To end with, unless this technology is enhanced and backed up with science instead of opinion I do not think it will be very dependable in determing the emotional expressions of students. 
1423	what is best for the student 
1424	Both ideas have great benefits and help the student in their own way. 
1425	But I feel they should take it a little more exstreme for things like could also have audio and could really help with peoples lives. Not even the bad emotions if you are happy or exicted it can sense that and something good could happen.  
1426	But I also feel that it could be more to it then just looking for emotions. Even if they are good emotions there should be something to say or something should light up when the senseor feels that you are happy.  They should test it out and see how it goes and turns out for some people and if things go good the they should move it to the next step and add audio and see how much it makes a impact on peoples lifes. 
1427	Peoples emotions shows alot it can say so much about their personality or how they feel about life, it could even gives you signs about that person and could get people aware so they can put thst person in a safe place if they need to. There should also be bounderies because most people arn't gonna want a computer screen or phone screen watching them, their emotions or even listening to them. But to even fix that you could always have were you could turn the senseor on an off just so people could feel more surcure. 
1428	the process begins with thecomputer conster a 3-d mold of the face there are 44 mojor muscles in model that make a action untit.  classfild as happyiness , suprise , anger , disgust , fear , and sadness when your frontails rise when suprise or you orbicular oris will tightens your lips to show anger . facial expression are univer observers .

1429	went through the greenhouse effect while is was being created. Venus has a thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent of carbon dioxide blankets around it. The temperatures on average is around 800 degrees fahrenheit. Venus has more powerful earthquakes,erupting volcanoes and frequent lightning strikes. 
1430	It says that NASA is working on approaches for getting to venus. Like for example,simplified electronics made of silicon carbide has been tested through a chamber. A vehicle hovering over venus would avoid the ground but the surface would still be hot at around 170 degrees fahrenheit. Venus can sometimes be a good planetary visit. The planet has rocky sediments on its surface such as valleys,mountains and craters. 
1431	A phone or a tablet being exposed to acid could be heat capable to melting just imagine what that would be like. By comparing it with a system that uses mechanical parts the system can be made to be more resistant from pressure and heat resources. Many researchers cannot take gas or rock from a distance. Humans would survive if there is solar power from venus. When trying to meet the challenge venus presented it has value the human curiosity will lead to us to many intimidating endeavors. 
1432	There are advantages of limiting car usage, but not as much as you thought. 
1433	"According to Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother, when she had a car, she was always tense. Now that she told it, Walter seemed to be much happier. In Freiburg, Vurban's streets are ""care-free"". But, once you go to the main thoroughfare, cars will be sworming down the road. Most people may think, ""I need a car to get to where I need to go faster."" ""I can't live without a car.""  In 2006, trend in Europe grew... No cars or anything. Automobiles are the linchpin of suburbs where middle class families from Chicago to Shanghai make their homes. Passanger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions. 50 percent in some car intensive area in US. Home to 5,500 residents within a rectangular square mile, may be the most advanced experiment in low car suburban life.  Levittown and Scarsdale, New York suburbs with enormous rich people homes with private garages were dream towns back in the 1950s. The US is promoting ""car reduced"" communities, and legislators are starting to act. "
1434	Just recently the state of Georgia ban the use of cell phones while driving. I believe there is no text back to that person that can not wait. We should take life precious. in the UK cell phones are banned. I believe all call phones should be banned. Recently researchers have come up with a way of using our phones while driving.  In order to do that they have came up with advanced vehicle that we can make phone calls with touching our phones by using the aux. 
1435	I also could be wrong becuase they do have a Mars rover up there so my theory can be wrong and it is a face all along. 
1436	The SCAÂ is when host the school dances or fundraisers. 
1437	They do school dances by getting it all planed like getting a DJ, food, games, buses. Also they do fundraisers because this is how they get money for school equipment like new PE equipment and better technology so we can have better computers. But the school dances help with these things to. This is why we need all the school dances and fundraisers. 
1438	The gaming club is not a sport but it's competitive thing 
1439	The gaming club is for people who does not like to play outside don't like getting hurt. You can compete against people in battle games or sport games. Say if you like sports you just dont like playing it in real life only in video games because it seems better to you thats okay. Thats why the gaming club is so cool you can play it on TV instead of in real life. 
1440	As technology advanced, the author claims that more and more missions to Venus occured, and even around the time of World War II there was a spacecraft that survived in Venus conditions for about three weeks. 
1441	because it identfies mona lisa's emotions how one picture can describe her self as calculating emotions. constructs a 3-D computer model of the face. all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human mules. movent one of one or more musles. movent of one or more musles is called an action untit in fact we humans preform this same impressive caluculation every day for instance you can prolly tell a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face of corce most of us would have trouble actully describing each facial trait that conveys happy wooried etc ..... i oberserved that artist such as da vicci studies human anatomy to help them paint facial musles precilely enough to convey specific emotions his new compuer sofftware stores simlar anatomical imformation as electronical code. the mona lisa demostrating is really intended to bring a smile to your face, while it shows just how much this computer can do. imagine a computer that knows when your happy or sad . by the way, did making a happy face in this experiment also mmake you feel slightly happy ? accoring to the facial feed back therory of emotion moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions but also may even help produce them. whoever thought that amking faces could reveal so much about the science of emotions!   
1442	"if there is one thing I know about American politics, its that political parties will oppose just about anything, no matter how advantageous or logical, ""limiting car usage"" is no exception, if the Democratic party were to suggest such a thing, it would create an upoar from the Republican and Libertarian parties. This would become more controversial than gun restrictions, we would have another surge of anti-environmentalism propoganda, Limbaugh would be spitting ""tree-huggers"" again, and more likely than not, our country would drift even further away from any sort of environmental solutions. Trying to limit car usage on a Federal level would be met by utter failure. "
1443	Have you guys ever seen the unmasking face on Mars? If not you probably should! 
1444	It's located on Mars at 41 degrees north martian latitiude. If you're sitting around bored at home just imagine all the amazing sites to see when you are visiting The Face of Mars. 
1445	One reason people might go here is because of all the fun, excitement,and interesting tings on or around the face of Mars. 
1446	Like just imagine all the craters and the amazement for people all ages. Why sit at home when you can be emjoying yourself with various adventures. 
1447	Another reason may be just getting out of the house and exploring. 
1448	You don't just have to stay in one area on mars you can go anywhere. Let me start by saying it would be an excellent experience for both kids and adults. 
1449	Others say that hey found it boring and uninteresting. Look on the bright side not all people are like that some people might like the outerspace world. It just depends in what you like and dont like. Well I hope you enjoy your time while visiting The Face of Mars. 
1450	 From now, human can say we are have most feeling in the world, We can be sad we can be happy, we can be angry about something we can also say'' what's a pity'' but how to show us emotion? Use our face! someone said, how to know somebody emotion? Use our eyes! Somebody day again, but do you know that now we have now the number of you emotion.  What's will like? For example one of most famouse art Mona Lisa, one lady always have a secret smille, she is 83 happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6percent fearful, and 2 percent angry. So amazing right? When I saw the result maybe because of that Mona lisa have beautiful of time. Complate emotion very easy to touch people's heart. this software is form University of lllinois , they hope developing better ways for humans and computers to communicate. How it work? The process begins with 3-D computer model easy to say just build a modle of the face and cumputer will calute the way muscles move and he can know the percent of your emotions, depend on each musclesthe cpmputer will know how ''happy'' you was. 
1451	So this prosses sound like cool but it just show how much computer can do it not meaing it 100 right. 
1452	Why should you join the Seagoing Program? 
1453	.Ever since they were invented in 1700s people have taken the full advantage of the telephone presidents and war sargents used them to win battles and etc. Now the phone has evolved from tube looking phones to brick phones to flip phones to iphones and to smartphones 
1454	With all the crashes maybe we should drive without our phones but with the increments in technology we mind as well just use them cars are able to call people just like phones, so if you can call people in your car and be distracted anyways when your calling whom ever 
1455	There putting almost smartphones in the car so you can most defiantly be distracted with that. The fact that they are and already are making cars able to drive by themselves is anther reason that is very distracting just as in Tulsa the electrically powered car has pilot mode so it drives itself. So many people have been distracted from the road and driving because the car can drive itself even though the car can drive itself you still need to pay attention to the road. 
1456	It might seem like it is not a responsibility owning a phone but it is when you own a phone you have personal information in it. If you were lose your phone and have never put a password or security code on it you can lose your information to whoever has your phone could be a hacker could be a random thieve.  
1457	Cause if you drive irresponsibly you should have your phone.        
1458	Life without cars can also be beneficial to ones community 
1459	Some school require students to complete summer projects. 
1460	Despite this valid reasons there are does who think teacher should pick the topic. 
1461	"Venus is called the ""Evening Star"" and it's one of the brightest points of lights in the night sky. Venus is the second planet from the sun. It has been often refered to as earth's twin. It's been over three decades since a spacecraft has touched down on Venus. The carbon dioxide level is at 97 percent, and their are clouds of highly corrsive sulfuric acid and the average temerature is 800 degrees in fehrenheit, and the atomospheric pressure is 90 times greater than our planets. This environment would crush a submarine even when its accustomed to diving in the deepest parts of our oceans. Venus also has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in the solar system even though Mercury is closer to the sun. And the weather presents errupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lighting strikes to probes seeking to land on it surface. Venus once was the most Earth-like planet in our solar sytem that could have supported various forms of life like Earth. NASA has a possible solution to allow humans to study Venus, they will have to where we could hover 30 miles above the landscape so it'd be at sea level and the temerture would be at 170 degrees fehreheit, it won't be easy conditions but they are survivable for humans. They will be limited from what they can see and get. Others are trying for a more simplified approach by making electronics out of silicon carbide, which can last 3 weeks in Venus's conditions. Another one is Mechanical Computers which goes back as far as the 1800s and then played an important role in the 1940's during World War II. They made calculations by using gears and levers and did not require electronics at all. Modern computers are powerful. flexible, and quick but they are more delicate while a system made out of mechanical parts can be made to be more resistant to pressure, heat, and other forces. "
1462	"In the article it says that she is 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgust, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry somethings or technology cant do that or some people cant do that at all and that is suprsing but what they call it is the ""Da Vnci Code"" an the name sounds cool and makes seans.  Well the whole process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of all faces; all 44 major musals in the model must move like human muscels. Movement of one or more muscels is called an ""action unit."" Then Dr. Huang relies on the work of psychologist, such as Dr. Paul Eckman, Creator of FACS. Eckman has classifed six basic emotions-happiness, surprise, anger,disgust, fear, and sadness and then associated each with characteristic movements of the facial muscles "
1463	.Here is a example in the article 1. Raise your lips at the corner of your mouth.  2. Than Squint your eyes slightly, to produce wrinking at the corner of your eyes.  3 Holding that, raise the outer parts of your cheeks up, toward your eyes.  According to the Facial Feedback Theory of Emoton, moving your facial muscels not only expresses emotions, but also may even help produce them.  A renowned drama couch, Constantin Stanislavsky, had his actors carefully reproduce smiling and frowning as a way of creating these emotons on stage.   
1464	When we first released the origonal photo we had hoped the public would take notice of mars. 
1465	"""meanong no space craft has survied for more than a couple of hours. The article also states that ""numerous factors contribute to venu's reutation as a challenging planet for humans to study""meaning its already a hard planet to study. The plant is also almost 97% carbon dioxide blankets venus. Venus is also a very hot place,in the article it states that ""temperatures average over 800 degrees fahrenheit and a atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet"". The article also says that ""these conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on earth"" meaning that the tempertures are way too extreme for us humans "
1466	In the passage it states that you can make nine trips morethan the other seagoing cowboy. In the passage it also states that they had benfits of seeing Europe and China. This kind of proves how Luke's trying to convince.  Another reason that luke trying to convince you. In the passge it states that Luke torned an excavated castle in crete and marveled at the panama canal on his way to china. Another detail from the passage is that Katie farm as a boy had prepare Luke for hard work but not for the dangers at sea. This also can of proves how Luke trying to convince.  Luke's point of view is first person beacuse he talks about how he got into seagoing cowboys .In the passsage it states that he had bales of hay and bags of oats had to be pulled up from the lower holds of the ship. Next ,It states that a small strip of metal along the edge stopped his slide ,keep   
1467	"president obamas ambitious goals to curb the united states greenhouse emmissions, unveiled last week ,will geta fortuitous assist from an incipent shift in american behavior: recent studies suggest that america is buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer liscenses as years go by. that has left researchers pondering a fundamental question:has america passed peak driving? the united states with its broad expanses and suburban ideals, had been one of the worlds prime car cultures. it is the birth place of the model T; the home of detroit; the place where Wilson Pickett immortalized ""mustang sally"" just kidding im not gonna copy all of that. "
1468	in nelson nevada there are no more cars to be found, people are literally flying everywhere! 
1469	it sounds crazy, but its not ,because researchers in the area were working on a new unknown chemical when all of the sudden somehow the chemical got leaked into the citys water system and well it had profound effects on everybody and now people are flying everywhere, nelson nevada plans to make a super highway in the clouds including speed limits and even police officers. this has really changed society. 
1470	On the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degress Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet. The conditions of Venus are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth. However, peering at Venus from a ship or orbitting or hovering safely far above the planet can provide only limited insight on ground conditions because most forms of light cannot penetrate the dense atomsphere.  
1471	"In Paragraph 8, it states, ""Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also human curiousity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors. Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should expanded to meet the very deges of imagination and innovation.""         "
1472	If we find life on Venus it would prove that their are other life out there 
1473	There could be life under the ground but we wouldn't know that cause we cant even get to the surface of the plant. If there is life on the plant we could learn how they world by watching. Maybe even with pictures. With oceans we could find if there are organisms in it. It would prove that there is a different kind of life on the planet.  
1474	If its the same kind we have on earth or if there are ones we dont even know of. If we could grow plants in the soil or if there are plants growing in it. If we go under the ground there could be worm like creatures or even caves. Who knows how big the caves could be or what could be in it. 
1475	Now with getting to Venus. We would need a ship or rover that could with stand the pressure of the plant 
1476	One that could maybe could go under ground and have something stick out from the ground every once in awhile. Maybe even one that could stay in the water of the plant. If we can build a ship that can with stand all of Venuses wearher. Than we could study it freely. 
1477	This is what i think Lukes point of view for convincing people to come. 
1478	In conclusion, the computer now encode different emotions if write down some simple instructions. This help us for can know if the Mona Lisa is smiling or had another emotion in her face. Not only with the Mona Lisa, can use that with anotner person. 
1479	it also is a better way for humans to connect with the computers as it says that in paragraph 1 
1480	They can hurt kids and cause road problems. They could even mess up their jobs focusing on their phone and not the objective. Devices can become over powering.  
1481	They can get addicted to their phone and not pay attention. Devices get addicting and can do too much and can decrease focus. They can be going through a problem and not focus on their man goal. 
1482	It said the cowboys played baseball,volleyball,table tennis tornaments,fencing,boxing,reading,whittling,and games that help pass time so 
1483	i think he was like showing people and telling people about its so fun 
1484	What if some of the kids dont wanna do it or think that there not smart to try. 
1485	I don't believe a technology can identify human emotions 
1486	a computer cannot tell whether a person is happy, sad, fear,angry. 
1487	I still don't believe that can ever happen because we express how we feel we can't count our emotions. 
1488	In the difference in seep mean that sometimes we are closer to, Mars and other times to Venus. The author says that on Venus surface, temperatures average over 800 deggrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on Earth. 
1489	In the article the author says that Venus has the hottest temperatures of any planet in our solar system 
1490	In Venus weather present additional impbnediments like for eripting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning strikes. 
1491	The author is putting examples of how imaging a blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the roiling venusian landscape. 
1492	Just for the jets airplane travel at a higher altitude to fly ovwer many storms or anything thats going on and see how things happen why they happen and is there a pattern an which way they happen. 
1493	But if it works than the researchers can not take samples of rocks and gas or anything else. 
1494	Therefore the sicentists seeking to conduct a thorough mission to understand Venus would need to get more closer up. NASA is working on other approaches to study Venus. Anotherproject is looking back to an old technology called mechanical computers. the Author gives examples on how NASA is trying to study Venus.  
1495	You dont always have to be excersizing to be outside or doing something other than being in your house all day. When you get out of the house you think about things like walking the dof through the neighborhood, or dropping your kids off with thier friends somewhere but you never really think about other things you could be doing when your not busy. You could hands down take a long walk around the neighborhood matter fact you could even jog/run,You could pick up some trash around the neighborhood and watch the ecosystem and get out more.  
1496	Now if America's citizens are driving less each year then let it happen and in a few years come back to the data that is presented in passage 4 
1497	So basically let it all happen on its own and not have to force it like Paris has done with giving out fines for whoever is driving a car with odd numbered license plates on mondays and even on tuesdays. 
1498	I have read the article of ''Unmasking the Face on Mars.'' When I imagine that if I were a scientist at NASA discussing the Face with someone who thinks it was created by aliens.  
1499	First of all,in September,1997,one of the chief scientist man said ''When they arrived at the Red Planet,''We felt this was important to taxpayer. A few days later NASA was unveiled the image for all to see.''Jim Garvin also say that ''We photographed the face as soon as we could get a good shot at it.'' Which mean they were trying to shot a picture of the  Face that they saw in Mars.  
1500	'After all that happened nobody was not really sure which one was the right one. 
1501	Using this tecnology is valuable because anatomy to allowed them paint facial muscles precisely enough to convey specific emotions. to how it's going to work on the compter. It's valuable because it can tell how Mona Lisa demontrates is really intended to bring a smile. 
1502	The muscled called?  Orbicularis oculi pars palpabraeus make crows-feet around your eyes. That means how the face muscles. It work and whats it called to get ride of these thing's. Before hand, it make the false smile, the mouth streched sideways using the zygosmtic major and a diffrent muscle .  
1503	according to the reading in paragraph 7 while looking in the mirror rise your lips at. The corners of your mouth is decribing you reaction to your face. Then squint your eyes slightly to produced wrinkling, Holding that, raise the outer parts of your cheeks of your cheeck up, torward you eyes. 
1504	Conclusion states that people have beautful everything around them! Not to mention, while looking in the mirrow process can make you a good pro at expressing your emtions. secdonly, muscles it's an expert, faces don't lie. These muscles clues are somtimes used to spot when smiling. Politiian or celebritu isn't being truthful. 
1505	"what about this it was made by the rover running over rocks and they tumbled to make the face like appearence."" "
1506	"""Venus is often referred to as Earth's twin"" Paragraph 2, is perfect arguement to start with, because as you can see venus is already considered as twin of Earth. It's natural geographic is similar to Earth's, so it already proves Venus could had a possibility of having oceans, lake, and bodies of water in the past. The density and size is same to Earth too so we will have vaguely same space as Earth. Venus is too hot to survive so we can do blimp-like vehicle above venus and still stay in their gravity and have people survive in the atmosphere above the fray. We could send people over there to research first before doing anything, If they makes people feels safer about living on Venus. "
1507	Some kids are to scared to play any sports or join in a school activity, because they are shy to talk to people. After all you get to have a lot of fun playing with your friends after school. 
1508	it will help kid from getting fat 
1509	"In paragraph 6 the author uses the exmple of how we could use this new technology during school for example he wrote, ""If you smile when a web ad appears on you screen a similar ad might follow. But if you frown, th next ad might be different."" "
1510	"In the article ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" the authors support to his knowledge of Venus is very informative. "
1511	"Astronomers believe venus to have been ""covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth."" According the the knowledge of the article ""the planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters"" stateting that Venus and Earth are and where once similar at a point in time "
1512	"NASA believed to be coming up with multiple ways for humans to set foot on the planet without any complications, at the moment NASA's only way of getting near the planet with stable temperatures and pressure is by having a ""blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the roiling Venusian landscape."" "
1513	So you think that the land formation coincedentally 'a face' created by the weathering. Proves to be a significant amount of source to say there were aliens or a civilation 
1514	in conclusion you personally will not change your mind about this becuase it a conspiracy life has been held up by this making money off of this rejoicing of nothing but a rock. Just like area 51 another conspiracy theorys where there is claimed to be unexposed life form when really its just a testing site for us millitary. Also the illumanati claimed to be the ones running the music industry and society. there many conspiracy theorys, but maybe just maybe theyare controlling us of what they dont want us to know making people think the conspiracys are a joke when in reality they are true. Iastly nothing can come off a rock as i said its a natural formation a rock to be 'told'. 
1515	He joined the programe for many reasons to help familys out with yard work and things like that when the husbands and fathes were at war. Also he helped with grocery stores and lots of bisnesses and he helped countrys recover food. He said it was an opertunity of a lift time to do this. He helped a lady at a farm all by her self. He went on a ship to go other places and help and on board he found some time to be him and just have fun. On lukes second trip he served watch men. He was to check on all of the animals and it was rainy out and he sliped and fell down very wet steps he almost slid out of the boat but a lucky peace of meatal beam was there and he stop right before he went out of an open side of the boat. but this put him on medical leave so he couldent work so I bet he was a little upset that he couldent help on the boat or where ever they stoped to help on land. He had fun with table tennis tournements fencing boxing reaidin and whittling the games he played helped pass time on the bout and just relaxe for a wile and have some fun. He said being a seagoing was much more than an adventure for luke boberger. He is greatful for this oppertunity he says and made it more aware to people in other countrys that that had food and nice people to give it to them. 
1516	For the muscle and painting part of the passage. I think it had no relavents to the main idea of emotion based pop ups 
1517	"Back then when the Mona Lisa was painted they didn't have computors or advanced technology. It could of been stated a little bit diffrent. Like"" Mona Lisa never rarly smiled, but now as technology advanced and we now know that muscles change our facial emotions."" "
1518	As I said before I believe that people shouldn't use their phones while driving, but if you look at it from another person's point of view you start to wonder if like what if the person is a person who is sick and needs to be checked on every now and then, or someone who has to have assistance on something. 
1519	After that, you got to be able to back up your answer , and saying why it is not a face. 
1520	People can asume it is a human's face because it look likes it. Another thing is that there is human's face on it, can mean life on the planet, Mars. Also the rock or the artifact does have an Egyptian Pharoah, it could mean a human was at one point up there. It probably is possible to have civilization on Mars. 
1521	In conclusion, the artifact could have just been hit by a rock. People need to belive most things that are not really true. 
1522	So there was a time when Luke signed up to be a sea cowboy because he said it was an opportunity of a lifetime to do this journy. 
1523	One of the things that Venus is dangerous becasue of its thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets the planet. The danger of this is that the clouds are made up of highly corrosive sulfuric acid. The acid can nearly kill you if there is a little bit touching you in any shape or form. Otherwise, Earth surface is on a average of over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the pressure is 90 times that what we have on our planet.  
1524	In conclusion Venus is very dangerous for any kind to be on, such as animals or humans. Although the plant is pretty hot its not good to be on it.          
1525	"""  In German suburb,Life goes on without cars  ""  ,by  Elisabeth  Rosenthal ,From the  New York Times ,It examines that,""70 percent of vauban's Families in Germany do not own the cars,and 57 percent sold a car to move here"".

1526	The Facial Action Coding System (FACS) can prove how a person is feeling due to having a 3-D computer model 
1527	an electronic code 
1528	and a facial software 
1529	First, the FACS has a 3-D computer model to help it figure out a persons emotion. 
1530	Second, the FACS also has an electronic code which helps the system understand better the emotion 
1531	Lastly, the facial software helps FACS by using human features on the face understand the emotions 
1532	Do you agree with the princable about. Evrey student must particapait in at least one of these three things. Number one they must paly a school sport,They can be a yearbook desiner,or a school counclier. Well I am going to go in more depth and explaine the jobs to you. 
1533	Last but not least school conciol. The school counciol does a lot of things here are a few. 
1534	Say for example the student would have to go outside in have to play sport's. But they would go over the rules for every sport that they have out to play with. 
1535	in the article it says that numerous spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours, maybe thiss issue explains why nit a single spaceship has touched down on Venus more than three decades, Numerous factors contribute to Venus's reputation as a challenging planet for humans to studydespite its proximity to us. Also, the temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our planet. Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system, even though Mercury is closer to our sun. Venusian geology and weather present additional impediments like erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning strikes to probes seeking land on surface. However, peering at Venus from a ship orbiting or hovering safely far above the planet can provide only limited insight on ground conditions because most forms of light cannot penetrate the dense atmosphere,rendering standard forms of photography the dense videography ineffective. Venus is so hot that it can melt metal. 
1536	 Why do people by more than one car its only one of them and mulitiply cars so why waste money more than one car when you can sell your for things that are important like paying a bill or get gorcery for you house or just helping otherss out so i thing that dumb for peole to have more than one car if you are not going to use the cars all time I understand that celebrites haves mulitiply cars because they show them but the car usage is still high but people can do what evere they want with there money who I am just a boy i coming telling you people with more than car is really really ricdulious to but hey I am going sit back and let people use up there gas in there so be it.Â Â     
1537	Studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers because Venus is the closest planet to Earth In the terms of the density and size, and on distance too, but each previos mission was unmanned, no spcaecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours. It's been three decades since a spaceship has touched down on Venus, Is a challenging planet for the humans to study even despite of the proximity to us. Also, there's a thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent of carbon dioxide blankets on Venus, but what's more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in the Venus atmosphere.  The temperature average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and also the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what is on planet Earth, the conditions are far more extreme than anything we humans encounter on Earth. Even if Mercury is closer to the sun, Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any other planet on the solar sytem and it also presents additional impedimentslike powerful earthquakes, erupting volcanoes. 
1538	If the scientists know everything about this why are they discussing about visiting Venus if it isn't a good place where we humans could be and live at, because we wouldn't even be able to live for a day just as the spacecraft that didn't even survided just only for a few hours. 
1539	Probably long ago just as it says on paragraph 4 that, Venus was maybe covered largely with oceans and it could have supported various forms of life just like here on Earth and Venus then also has some features that are analogous to Earth. 
1540	It's better to keep studying Venus then to just go visit it, because there would probably be stuff on Venus that the scientist don't even know about and then the people that would go visit Venus would be in such danger. 
1541	In conlusion, scientist should still be doing research about Venus, because everything they have known recently about Venus it sounds really dangerous just to go and see it on their own then they would put their lifes in danger, and I don't think that's what they want 
1542	It's better to keep doing more research about it instead of just going without knowing everything about the planet. 
1543	Everyone would want to try and see what their emotions say. So if they did come out with something like this alot of them would sell quick and i know they wont be cheap. We have came so fare from having to wait 5 minutes to take a picture to now being able to tell a persons emotions by a computer just reading there face. 
1544	The author suggest that studying venus is a worthy pursuit 
1545	striving to meet the challenge presented by venus has value. because human curiosty will likely lead us into many equally intimidating enveavors. travelers on earth and beyond should not be limited by danger to explore venus more. venus should be expanded to help meet the edges of imagination and inovation.  
1546	i think that the more NSA workes together to make tool to go see mre of venus them they will be able to explore more anytime. 
1547	"In the story ""A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves"" Luke was a cowboy rode the waves. he helped people in Europe after War World 2. Luke went to Europe to help people that didn't have shelter, food or animals. When Luke just graduated highschool his friend Don asked him if he wanted to go to Europe. Luke knew he couldn't pass this opportunity of a lifetime up.44 Nations joined together to form  UNRRA [ther United Nations Relief and Rehabilitaton Administration.] ""UNRRA hired ""Seagoing Cowboys"" to take care of the horses, young cowes, and mules that were shipped overseas. Luke and Don signed up."" Luke wanted to help people if he didn't go he wouldn't like to help people.  'Luke did get some free time when he was on the boat he got to see Venice, Italy he also toured an excavated castle in Crete and mareled at the Panama  China"" he got to see many things many people don't get the chance to ever see. It was an aventure for him. ""it took about to weeks to cross the Atlantic Ocean from the eastern coast of the United States and a month to get to china"" It was hard work to keep ever animal safe and alive on the long journey and animals could have died of sickness and cancer and a lot of other thing like not getting any excercie. "" Heping out on his aunt Katie's farm as a boy had prepared Luke for hard work, but not for dangers at sea. On Lukes second trip, Luke served as night watchman. His job awas to cheack on all the animals every hour. One rainy night, after making his hourly report to the captian, he slid down a slippery ladder on his backside. Luke's haert raced as he shot feet firt toward an opening on the side of the ship. a small strip of metal along the edge stopped his slide, keeping him from flying overborad into the dark Atlantic. He was happy to be alive. But he couyld not work for a coulpe of days because of vraked ribs."" He was really happy to be alive and he was ok with craked ribs because he was alive. "
1548	Some students do not like going to talk to the teacher so maybe if the teacher talks to the student they might feel more better and the teacher will also know about that as well. 
1549	I think if we got it in schools right now it would probably help. 
1550	Human curiosity is leading us to find more knowledge of our sister planet.   
1551	"Luke had just graduated college and his friend Don Reist invited Luke to go to Europe with him. Luke said yes because it was an opportunity of a lifetime and he could not pass it up. Luke became a Seagoing Cowboy.  Luke said, ""Being a Seagoing Cowboy he got to see Europe, China and he got to see the Acropolis in Greece."" He got to see so many great sites. Luke toured an excaveted castle in crete and he marveled at the Panama Canal on his way to China.  Luke had to travel a lot. But, even though it took two weeks to cross the Atlantic Ocean from the eastern coast of the United states and a month to get to China. On the long journey  Luke stayed busy by taking care of animals. Taking care of animals and traveling was not all Luke did on the boat, the cowboys played lots of games. Some of the games they played was baseball and volleyball games in the empty holds where animals lived. They also did table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling and other games to pass time.  Luke said that ""being a Seagoing Cowboy was much more than an adventure."" For Luke it opened up the world to him "
1552	how we will 
1553	In all, the author did really good with this article and also put some good time into this article too. I enjoyed reading this and learned some interesting facts about Venus. 
1554	These facts lead to the evidence is many ways 
1555	Studying Venus is a good idea and learn more about the Venus from other planet and Venus has a pretty good nickname and The National aeronautics and Space Administration has one particulary compelling idea for sending humans to study venus, Imagine a blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the roiling Venusian landscape. 
1556	You think technology can read emotional face expretion? 
1557	Yes I think because the new technology are very avanced 
1558	cameras have many fuctions and are very smart for take of pictures, the new cell phones have this technology one example is Iphone 7 or Galaxy 8 this smartphones have many technology, they know when are you sad or happy they have a special camera.  The news computers have many technology they are the best for this work because you can modify of system , you can put one camera and stard to work, you need create of program for analized of expretions and you can suporting with other student .  One need put of front to the camera and other need take picture and analized in computer, the next step is analized the facial expretions and see the muscles his face, eyes, cheeks or his smile the computer need analized the information and procces.  First student have a natural smile and computer detected this, he is happy, next student are crying, computer analized he is sad. but when student have pockarface the computer no detected nothing because no have any emotions, but what happen when one student make falce smile, but this is really good, I think of the computer detected he is happy.  
1559	I think of people need make manny technology because actual computers can be trick 
1560	Unless it is a decatetated head. The land scape couldv'e played an trick on us. 
1561	Yes, we have found flowing water but we have not found any type of living orgamisim. 
1562	In 1945 world war two was going on in Europe. Don Reist invited Luke Bomberger to go to Europe. When they got there Luke and Don both sighed up to help with the animals that were shiped overseas.  In the story it said, in August 1945,Luke and Don bolth got there orders to go to New Orleans. Luke and Don arrived they day the war ended. the they went to greece Luke turned 18 before arriving at greece and Luke might be able to get drafted foe the millitary.  Accroding to the text, By the time Luke was drafted he had already made 9 trips the most of any seagoing cowboy. Luke was traviling from the Atlantic Ocean to the eastern caost of the united states. Luke said it took about two weeks to cross the Alantic Ocean and a mounth to get to China. Luke was carring for the animals that were crossing and they had to fed and waterd two or three times a day.  the animals food had to be pulled from the lower holds of the ship so they could eat. Luke was prepard for this because he had to help out on his aunts farm.  Conclusion, On one rany cold night Luke was on watch to watch the animlas and he went to go tell the captian the report and he slipped down the ladder and had cracked ribs.   
1563	Astronots and scientists have been tryong to beat the challenges of Venus. 
1564	It also identify if your making a fake smile or not as it can tell by how you make your smile like, if you make a fake smile your mouth is stretched sideways, as in a real smile your zygomtic major(that begin at your cheek bonees) lift the corners of your mouth. 
1565	In more of the storyhe tells you the things yo are exprcted to see on venus. Venus was covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life,just like earth. The planet has a surfae of rocky sediment and includes familiar features suck as valleys, mountains, and craters. 
1566	Advantages include 
1567	FACS can also tell emotions just like on your face musles. 
1568	in germany people dont have cars like they do in america. in germans people have to have a big place to park there car like a large garage. but i it costs 40,000 dollars to buy the garage. so 70 percent of germany doesnt have a car.  on monday motorists are told to leave there car at home or there is a 31 dollar fine. almost 4,000 drivers where fined one day.27 people had there car impounded because of ther reaction to the fine. cars have been baned for 3 years. only buses and taxies are permited for the day. there goal is to promote alternative transport. violators faced a 25 dollar fine.  parks and sprots cneters have bloomed since they have scut traffic. presdient obama has ambitious goals to curb america. studdies show that fewer americans are buying cars and getting less licenses asÂ  the years go by.  in america as of april 2013 the number of miles driven was nearly 9 percent below the peak and equal to where the country was in january 1995.  new yorks new bike sharing program and its skyrocketingÂ  bridge and tunnel tolls reflect the new priortiy.    
1569	Why would you want to limit car usage. 
1570	When you use your car people are making money. People need a car to far away places fast. cars are expensive, thats because people keep adding on to it and making it more fancy and of corse its going to be more expencive.  If you limit cars most gas stations would be going out of bussniess and car places. gas stations buy the gas for cars to use yeah the gas is expensive but we need it and car dealerships would have so many cars they wouldnt know what to do with them cause no one would but them because there car would be limited to use so there car would be brand new. yes people are losseing alot of money from cars but its worth it cause we need to get places. if you make cars fancy yeah your going to have people to want to buy it but thats because you want them to buy it cars are killing the envirnment up though because the gas the people tearing into there grass people dont relize it but cars should just be used to get places and then stay there and then when there done go home. i mean if they can make a car that can scene if there drunk and wont start i would buy that car because it would tell you not to drive becaus eyou are drunk that will slove so many deaths and drunk driver accident problems. instead of making cars fast and look slicker and nicer and have the car talk to you with blootooth thats just dumb in my opion i wish they would just make cars more reasonable with things that really matter than just look nicer and more for rich people alot of people can afford cars so they should lower all prices and they would make more money becaus emore stuff will be sold like the drunk deceter carÂ     
1571	Also they don't know that the gas is ever high and they can't affored it and that why they walk or ride the bike.  Another reason is that 27 people had there can impounded or on side of the road becuaseÂ  they ran out of gas. when you drive and you see your gas meter and it on the E and your car just stop and you about 2 miles form the gas stion and you have a gas can in the back but you don't want to walk and you know you need that gas so that you can get home you think,think,think and you said i'm walk and you get out the car get the gas can and go. and people don't like drive they can just ride the train to work or the bus becuase you don't really have to put gas in your can you just ride and get drop off were you work. 
1572	Well if they family want to go on a trip to see there grandma then they can take there car and go see her. And what ever car you got please look for the limit becuase some car drink gas and then you have to fill it back up again. If it was just less driveing they approach stores,and other thing that they can walk to. If you need a ride home you can call the tax and they will take you home and you really don't have to drive or put gas in the car. 
1573	about 4,000 people don't have there license and the drive. if you drive and it cold you should trun a on the heat to low becuase heat will messup your emission. and that why i should think that people should walk stead of drive all the time. 
1574	In the article it says that Earth, Venus, and Mars, our other planetary neighbor, orbit the sun at different speeds. Venus is the second planet closest to the sun and because of that the tempetures in Venus are way different than Earth's tempetures. 
1575	Since Venus is the second closest planet to the sun the tempetures are really hot, compared to Earth's tempetures. Its so hot the tempetures in Venus are like 170 degrees Fahrenheit, but the air pressure would be close to that sea level on Earth. 
1576	Because the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face; with all 44 major mucles in the model move like human mucles. 
1577	"That ""classify the six basic emotions like happiness, surprise, anger, fear, and sadness, which then assosiats with each characteristic movement of the facial muscles.""  "
1578	congestion was down 60 percent so thats good in the capital of france after five days of intensifying smog. cold nights and warms days caused the warmer layer of air to trap car emissions. the united states has a program called the environmental protoction agency is promting car reduced communities and, ligislators are satrting to act.  disel fuel was blamed since france has a tax poloicy that favors disel over gasoline diseles make up 67 percent of vichles in france compared to a 53.3 percent averqage of desiel engines in the rest of wester europe according to reuters. Delivery companies coplianed of lost revenue while exceptions were made for plug in cars hybrids and the cars carrying three or more passengers. public transit was free of charge from firday to manday according to the bbc.  Bogota colombia in a program thats set to spread to other countries millions of colomians hiked biked skated or took buses to work during a car free day yesterday leaving the streets of this capital city eeri    
1579	Second reason I agree is that time is priceless it is not infinite people dont know how much time they really have therefor its better to make the best of it before its all gone therefor the people who have chosen to use there time. Wisely they have much more time cause they have done what they had to do getting more time but it docent mean the people around them will get the same cause they chose there path and they chose there toured success. By choosing that path they have chosen there futureÂ which docent really change unless there has been a large impact like death or courage to do what ever it takes to succeed no mater what any body says to try to turn you down. 
1580	If a student if feeling strong emotions such as saddness or fear; they need to talk to a friend about it, someone they can trust, not a computer. 
1581	Others might just nit want to answer the question. So it would be easier to just get your answer from a mechine that gives you the answer you want. 
1582	By allowing this flexibility of guidelines and rules, kids can stretch their ideas further without having to feel they have gone off-topic because it will be designed by them. 
1583	NASA is approching to studying Venus because of its Atmosphere. 
1584	"""The Challenging of Exploring Venus"", many scientists are wanting to exlpore Venus atmosphere. But it comes with risk and danger, possibly NASA scientists can break through that "
1585	Another reason that Venus would be suitable for humaity is because it is the second planet in the solar system and is exposded to a lot of sun light 
1586	As many people know, there is a big need for energy on Earth. As a result of this, the Earth is running out of fossial fuel and that is one of the reasons the Earth is dying. If humaity lived on Venus there would be a big source of solar energy, which is renewable energy. 
1587	From my poin of view I dont everybody needs a car. Some people just buy cars just to sdhow not knowing the reasons for having a car. 
1588	Although there are many dangers of sending vessels back to Venus, the author states that the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, otherwise known as NASA, is working on ways to send astronauts to Venus. The author also tells the reader that solar power on Venus would be abundant, and that radiation levels would be similar to those on Earth. He goes on to say that the temperature would be around 170 degrees Fahrenheit, not an ideal temperature for astronauts traveling to Venus, but it is survivable. 
1589	,like in the story the said that Luke had travewled nine diffrent times. 
1590	Im sure that a young mans mother would be happy to know that,they are cleaning, and obaying laws,and showing respecfulness. Oh and befor i forget, they also will be able to cook multipal meals for his family. 
1591	thats a great thing to help out with the animals. The young men will be helping around with horses,and cows. I am sure that the young man, will enjoy the view of the world that hes traviling. 
1592	In German suburb's, life goes on without cars. There is a new experimental district, that allows people to see how much you don't need a car for. The new district without any cars, has stores and malls in walking distance. so there is no need for a car. Which can save a person lots of money.  People have sold there cars to live in this new district. But if you moved with a car, when you buy a house. And a 40,000 dollar large garage on the edge of the development. The residents also say that not having a car is a lot less to worry about. And the Unite States is promoting car reduced communities.  Paris bands driving due to smog, Paris was forced to enforce a partial driving Ban. When days of near record pollution was getting higher. If u were cought breaking the band you would be fined. They lifted the band when the smog cleard enough.  Paris has more smog than any other European Capital. But diesel fuel was blamed, cause they have a tax policy that goes for diesel over regular gasoline. Although Beijing, China is the most polluted citie in the worlde.  Car-Free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota. Car free day, is when no cars are allowed on the road except buss's and taxis's. People walked, biked and, road bikes. Other Colombian cities are joining the year around event. People from different countrys came to see this event, and were enthusiastic about it.  The end of car culture, people have been buying and driving less in the past years. The amount people drive now is what it was in 1995. Also there as been a large drop in people geting there permintas and licenses, from 16 years old to 39 years old. And people have been taking public tranporstion and car-pooling more.    
1593	Letting the principal decide the students what to do, make me feel not very good because it make me feel like he is telling me what to do and i dont like that. 
1594	Some students are best other things and some are not. Many students have their own taste on something. 
1595	Im going to tell you if the facial action coding system is a good or bad idea 
1596	First the process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face; all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles. Movement of one or more muscles is called an Âaction unit. Then Dr. Huang relies on the work of psychologists, such as Dr. Paul Eckman, creator of FACS (Facial Action Coding System). Eckman has classified six basic emotionsÂ happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadnessÂ and then associated each with characteristic movements of the facial muscles. 
1597	The facial expressions for each emotion are universal,Â observes Dr. Huang, Âeven though individuals often show varying degrees of expressionÂ (like not smiling as broadly). Using video imagery, the new emotion-recognition software tracks these facial movementsÂ in a real face or in the painted face of Mona Lisa. By weighting the different units, the software can even identify mixed emotions (as in da VinciÂs masterpiece). Each expression is compared against a neutral face (showing no emotion).  
1598	In fact, we humans perform this same impressive ÂcalculationÂ every day. For instance, you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face. Of course, most of us would have trouble actually describing each facial trait that conveys happy, worried, etc. 
1599	Yet Dr. Huang observes that artists such as da Vinci studied human anatomy to help them paint facial muscles precisely enough to convey specific emotions. His new computer software stores similar anatomical information as electronic code. 
1600	The Mona Lisa demonstration is really intended to bring a smile to your face, while it shows just how much this computer can do. Imagine a computer that knows when youÂre happy or sad. For example, if you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be different. ÂA classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,Â Dr. Huang predicts. ÂThen it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor.Â The same technology can make computer-animated faces more expressiveÂ for video games or video surgery. ÂMost human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication,Â notes Dr. Huang. ÂSo computers need to understand that, too.Â  
1601	I belive the advantages of limitng a car usage. 
1602	we have most of the people who are not driving with the right responsible license 
1603	How the author support his suggests that studying venus is a worthy pursuit despite the danger it presents is 
1604	"venus is one of the brightest point of light in the night sky, making it simple for even an amateur stargazer to sopt.  Venus is the secoynd planet from our sun.  Venus is also referred to as Earth's twin, Venus is also the clostest planet in distance.  Venus is sometimes right around the coner in space terms, humas have sent numerous spacecraft to land in the cloud-draped world and no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours.  Venus has not been touch by any spaceship for more than three decades.  The article also said, ""on the planet's surface, temperatures averge over 8-- degrees fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet. These conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on earth; such an environment would crush even a submarine accustomed to diving in the deepest part of our oceans and would liquefy many metals.""  At thirty-plus miles above the surface, temperatures would still be toasty at around 170 degrees Fahrenheit, but the air pressure would be close to that of sea level on Earth.  Solar power would be plentiful and radiation would not ecceed Earth levels. Not easy conditions, but survivable for humans. "
1605	 In conclusion, No it is a natural landform. It could be a computer image hicup.  The land erodes. There are a lot of things that are natural and look like faces.  But, it still might not be natural. If it is unnatural then there could be other life out there. 
1606	Luke Bomberger was just an ordanery small town boy untill his friend ofered a jod as a seagoing cowboy. When he was thinking about it he said to him self that it would be a wonderfull oprtunet and just couldn't say no. He told his friend that he would take the jod.  When Luke truned 18 thay could have drafted him over to the army but they didn't. Luke claims in the article that he was ment for the job becues he was rased on his aunt's farm. Yet he was not ready for the sea.  Luke said he saw some pritty cool stuff. Thay also had some fun on the ship when the anamals were out. When Luke came home his aunt was probuly rilly thankfull that he came back ok.  He probuly was thankfull that he got to come home becoues the other seagoing cowboys didn't do as much seagoing as him. Luke said going over seas let him be more aware for people and there needs, thats what lead him to latter on hosting international students in his home for many years. 
1607	Facial expression does not have a set of rules you have to follow. For example, when someone is very angry, they might cry instead. In result, the computer might take it as sadness. 
1608	"Most of the time, facial expressions are easy to recognize. In paragraph 2 of ""Making Mona Lisa Smile,"" it says, ""Each expression is compared against a neutral face"" (D'Alto 2). Everyone has different neutral faces. Most people have a good way of keeping in their emotions, making their face look blank. "
1609	when being a TA you get to meet more students and get to know what they are like. When I walked into the class I would be helping in, I saw so many kids and got to meet so many of them and they all were cool. Being a TA is good for meeting others 
1610	"Luke was offered a trip to Europe on a boat by a friend and of course he couldn't say no. So Luke took the offer but World War II was going in Europe and many countries were left in ruins. A group called UNRRA (the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration) hired ""Seagoing Cowboys"" to take care of the animals that were shipped over seas.  According to the text in August 1945, they received their orders to report to New Orleans. They arrived August 14 the day the Pacific war was over. Luke turned 18 the day before arriving in Greece, which meant he could be drafted for military service. He was discharged in 1947 but Luke had already made nine trips the most any Seagoing Cowbody had ever done.  "
1611	Maybe its not just the students and the parents who are frustrated because most of teachers will be too. 
1612	After school can affect the community in different ways. 
1613	 He believes that it was a sign for something that the aliens were going to end up doing. 
1614	"In the article ""The challenge of Exploring Venus"" explains many things from talking about Venus all the way to what it exactly is "
1615	Dr Huang was a smart person in the facial expressions he was the one that was trying to found out things about the human communication for technolgoly. 
1616	Imagine if you was looking in the mirror and you suggest an emotion can your lab partner recongize your emotion 
1617	I would say you could but it all depends because you can't really tell because he can have a face emotion that you see him with everyday that don't mean that he happy it can mean that he mad or sad or tired.  
1618	I closed this section by saying that all computers and scentist can't recongize everybody emotion because everybody is different and experience different test on there emotion 
1619	I think that it can be no or yes. 
1620	""" So if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even a shack."" "
1621	because it would be neat that a scientists can scan on a computer to read students or anyone's emotions to see how they feel 
1622	"Paragraph 7 it shows you a list of what you can do that list will show you how you can see the expression, In fact those instructions for a face that makes you look happy it is all about those muscular action units which they can indictate the difference between a genuine smile and a forced one. So in a real smile which it says in paragrpah 7 "" zygomatic major "" which means that the muscles that begin at your cheek bones which will lift the corners of your mouth.  "
1623	According to the Facial feed back theory of emotion which is moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotion they may also even help produce them Constanin had his actors carfully reproduce smiling and frowning as a way of creating these emotions on stage 
1624	it should have been invented for something else. 
1625	but sometimes it is important to learn about ur emotions even if we don't want to because sometimes we could use the work of why we use so much emotions when we talk to people or even taking the trash out we all still use emotions but why do we. 
1626	in conclusion the whole story is about the science of emotions it lets everyone know if we are mad or sad even angry and sometimes people help out with getting ur anger down but not all the time does ur anger go down sometimes it stays up because you won't let anyone help you. our emotions are hard to hide but sometimes it helps like when ur mad but don't want to show it but you also want to show it because you want the person to leave you alone or put down something that i already yours. 
1627	body: some people use a stress ball to calm down and not a lot of people use it because they think it is for babys but some people need it if they can't keep there anger in check everyone needs to keep there anger in check if not there anger will get the best of them and then they will be getting in a whole lot of trouble from letting there anger get the best of them the best way to make sure you don't get angry is just to find something you like to do and do it then just put headphones on so you can just mute them and can't hear anything if they mess with you then go somewhere they won't go. 
1628	The use of technology is getting advanced more and more as each day goes on. So by now we should be able to know is Mona Lisa was smiling or not. Now these days technology is informational and often true so why shouldnt we belive the results. 
1629	In the first paragraph its states she is 83 percent happy,9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angery. By looking at the painting you would probaly belive that because she is smiling, she couldve been fearful because she didnt know Leonardo da Vinci, and she couldve been angery because at the time she wouldve had to be sitting there for hours until he finished or he would have to start all over. In the passage tehy dop have good evidence if you studied anatomy you would be able to understand how all the facial expressions work. They even claim that da Vinci studieed anatomy which helped him paint her facial muscle precisely. They even teach you how to make the same face she made in the painting. 
1630	he had did good about ut he did good going to venas would be good 
1631	so most people would want to take a trip there it is way to hot to be up there by your self as well as if your with ah group of people as well but the good thing about it is that you can have an exsperance to do somthing like you better do it it would not be good to miss out the had sent a rovor up there to see how things are going to work out as well also people are want to go there but yet it is 300 times more hot then earth its self as well..that is not many people have really been up to venus..also venus is a very rockey place also you can find metels there as well and last but not least yes to get to venus is a long space traval to get there it takes up to 6 years as well. and mars earth venus are all lined up right next to each other as well. 
1632	its is ever challenging visting, trying to do go and rescreach on a plant where you dont know anything about it. 
1633	Venus is the twin of earth, right around the corner. 
1634	Although you never know whats going to happen when exploring new things scientists find it very intresting to keep exploring Venus to keep finding out some of the features it has and maybe what it even used to look like. Venus is the second planet from the sun so its still very hot. 
1635	Why should we have to use technology to tell peoples emotions. 
1636	In the case of Mona Lisa i can see why they would use it there. It states that she`s 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry. I wouldn`t have known that if not for tech. 
1637	Why should we calculate emotions. We shouldn`t have to use 3-D computor model to tell the emotions of people. 
1638	So all i just said is basicly saying i don`t want this to be used. 
1639	"The story ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" Main purpuse was to in form us of the stugles of trying to find a whay to get humons on Venus, "
1640	In conclusion the author didn't explain very good of why should explore venus and he made it seem like can 
1641	even though this could have some really great benefits to it, it could also have some really bad ones. 
1642	Two of the many advantages of limiting the use of cars are 
1643	because it could make a sudent's work more easy for them to do because it could tell if the student is having a hard time on the work or just does not like the work they were givein like it says in the article.  
1644	Another thing it could be valuable for is how a students is feeling 
1645	But how do you get the others to believe thats theres not. Not everyone was satisfied 
1646	Lastly, NASA had many images for web surfer to see. 
1647	teachers are no joke though as they work day and night to give us students the best education possible, it's stressful being a teacher and in our eyes a worthy sacrifice.  Grading papers form 150 students and also having to stay on track and give out more papers is a hassle; thats why we have teacher aide's to help them get through the day which is selfless and deserves recognition 
1648	Lastly, it has since become a pop icon 
1649	Then, The sudies for Venus are pretty neat. 
1650	Finally, Despite the chanlleges and dangers they are all striving to meet the challenge. 
1651	Traveling Venus would be dangerous in many ways. 
1652	"For one, it is the second planet closes to the sun so it would be extremely hot. Next, the air pressure would be quite hard for humans to handle as well. In the passage it states, ""On the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet."" This clearly gives enough information to say that these conditions are more extreme than what any human can handle. "
1653	Luke's point of view is convincing others to participate in the seagoing cowboys program. 
1654	Venus id the closes planet to Earth in terms of density and size, and occasionally the closest in distamce too. Earth, Venus, and Mars, our other times to Venis. Bacause Venus is somentimes right atound the corner- in space terms-humans have sent numerous spacecraft to land on this cloud-draped world.  A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus. Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's armosphere. On the planet's surface, temperatures averga over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times grater than what we experience on our own planet.  The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters. Furhermore, recall that Venus can sometimes be our nearest option for a planetary visit, a crucial consideration given the long time frames os space travel.  The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has one particularle compelling idea for sending humans to study Venus.  More impotantntly, researchers cannot take samples of rock,gas, or anyrhing else, from a distance. Therefore, scientists seeking to conduct a thorough mission to understand Venus would need to get up close and personal despite the risk. Or maybe we should think of them as challenges.  NASA is working on other aproaches to studying Venus, For example, some simplified electronics the chaos of Venus's surface and have lasted for three weeks in such conditions. These devices were first envisioned in the 1800s and played an important role in the 1940s during world war ll. Modern computers are enormouslt powerful, flexible, and quick, but tend to be more delicated when it phone or tablet to acid or heat capable of melting tin. 
1655	Strivind to meet the callenge presented by Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself. 
1656	Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation. 
1657	By students getting the chance to try new things they could step out of their comfort zone and get the chance to explore new talents. Within students exploring new things they gain knowlege and gain more expreince on ther project. 
1658	The Face on Mars was a great mystery and a degree of surprise back in 1976 since they were just exploring mars at the time and didn't really know what to expect from it when they found that landform. Since then the Face became a pop icon and stared in multiple Hollywood films, magazines, and books. 
1659	 Teens and young adults ages though 18-24 are texting and driving more than any other age group. 
1660	The technology is intended to bring smile to your face. If you smile on a Web ad appears on your screen. They even indicate the difference between a genuine smile and forced one. The instruction are very simple, all you do is lift corner of your mouth and the computer knows the results. Moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions, but also may even help produce them. 
1661	Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break. Should these summer projects be teacher-designed or student-designed? Take a positive on this question. Support your response with reasons and specific examples. 
1662	The author supports this idea by giving information how its different from today then on the 1940s. 
1663	"The author is telling the reader on ""paragrahp 7"" to imagine a cell phone or tablet to acid or heat capable of melting tin.  Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size with the the author wants to say every planet has is own neighbor but they got thier sapce. The author wants to inform the planet Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system even thought Mercury is closer to our sun. The author claim is why are scientists even discussing further visits to its surface even when Venus still has some features that are analogous to those Earth. NASA has one particularly compelling idea for sending humas to studt Venus. "
1664	The author is saying on paragraph 8; 'Striving to meet the challenge presented by venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also only because of the human curiosity'. The travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovaton.   
1665	"Out of all the plants in the universe, I didn't think that there was going to be another ""Earth."" Many perople are scraed to travel out side of earth. I would also be scared. There is one "" Earth-like "" planet. Venus has very dangerous charateristics. "
1666	Venus is the closest plant to earth in terms of density, size, and in distance. Earth, Mars, and Venus all are planetary neighbors. Something Earth is closter to Mars or we are closer to Venus, it just depends on the different speed. Venus is sometimes around the corner, in space terms. We, humans, have sent plenty of spacecrafts to land on cloud-draped world. But none of the spacecrafts have survived the landing less than a day. We havent had a single spaceship land down on Venus in more three decades. 
1667	Venus has a thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon diocide covers it. The clouds are th echallenging part because of te sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere. The temperature is an average of about over 800 dergrees in Fahrenheit. The atmospheric presurre is 90 times greater that what we experince here on Earth. This conditiond are very extreme for us humans can encounter on earth. It also hads the hottest surface of temperture than any plant in our solar system. The geology and weather shows us erupting volcanoes, earthquakes, and constant lightning that strikes to the land of the surface. Venus is a very Earth-like plant in our solar system. It is covered with largely oceance and that could suppoort different forms of life, like our plant. It has a very rocky sediment which includes features such as valleys mountians, and craters 
1668	Venus has a lot of value. We should go out into the solar system and not be scare dof their dangers. I am sure that if Earth was empty and there were other things on Venus they would've been scared and would not want to come to Earth and do the things we are doing to Venus.  
1669	It states in the text that your freontailis pars lateralis muscle (above your eyes) raises your eyebrows when you're surprised 
1670	First of all, It is good to know that, because looking at old photographs taken you can see if the person is happy or not. 
1671	Finally, It is very inspiring how the computer can tell when your actually being serious with your facial expressions, and when you are not 
1672	after schoolÂ activity like sport can school clubs can also be on your patentÂ reared all out throw outÂ high school and on to college and thats why i think that student should participateÂ in one or more extracurricular activity.Â  Â  Â  Â  
1673	student designed is better because they should complete assignments.  For example, students assigns to work sience projects to help with environment.  This shows that students in science class should work together with a group members to complete projects to earn better grades. Clearly, working a group should student designed. Furthermore, student designed is better because they should complete assignments. For instance, students should be productive to complete all summer homework assignments. This proves that students should help with assignments that has classwork questions to work that much stuff. Obviously, completing a assignments should student designed 
1674	"The passage ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"" is a really intresting passage. In the text states, that ""VAUBAN, Germany-Residents of this upscale community are suburban pioneers, going where few soccer moms or commuting executives have ever gone before: they have given up their cars"". This shows, that if they have to go somewhere they go walking. Also the street parking, driveways and home garages are generally forbiden in this experimental new district on the outskirts of Freiburg.  However, In Vauban's streets are completely ""car-free""-except the main thoroughfare, where the tram to downtown Freiburg runs, and few streets on one of the edge of the community. But car ownership is allowed, but there are only two places to park, and is for $40,000, along with a house. And as a result , 70% of Vauban's families do not onw cars, and 57% sold a car to move there. Because when she had a car she was always tense. Also cars causes lazyness to do stuff, and it doesn't keep you healthty. For example, when you walk you stregh your body and and all the parts of your body are moving. But when you use car you sit down and sometimes that can cause a back problem.  Forthere more, all of our development since World War II has been centerd on the car, and that has to change. In Levittown and Scarsdale, New York suburbs withÂ  spread-out homes and private garages, were the drea towns of the 1950s and still exert a strong appel. This means, that back then spread-out homes and private garages where the dream towns. In the United States, the Enviromental Protection Agency is promoting ""car reduced"" communities are staring to act, caustiously.  Indeed, many experts escept public transporter serving suburbs to play much larger role in a new six year federal transpotation bills to be approved this year. Also in previous bills, 80% have by law gone to highways and only 20% to other transport "
1675	Mona Lisa face expressions are different than others face's, depending on how the person look with no smile, no anger, and no saddness. The emotional communication is nonverbal, showing the more emotion there is though our face's. Smile' are all differnet depending if it's a real one or a forced one. Faces don't lie, Smiling isn't being truthful they said. Willing to put on a face, it usually works most of the time, but not only to expresses emotion, it's tells us how they are feeling today or what they are going though 
1676	This not means what you can really see without the tech and just see the real feeling and the real smile or their sadness 
1677	This Facial Action Coding System is identifing the moment of the face right that minute, but not what they are feeling right after or before. 
1678	"On the day of March 2, 2006 a NASA worker Sally Herring was called to be on the news show "" All about that news"", she was asked to speak with news worker Ted Cruze about the sightings/picutres from Mars of the misterious ""face"".  As Sally was aproaching the stage of the news studio there was bunches of people in the audience waiting to hear the truth, but Sally was sure most of these people weren't going to hear what they want to hear because a lot of people are wrong with their opinions to this subject.  As the show begun the news reporter Ted Cruze asked the question everyone was waiting for, ""Are those pictures from Mars signs that aliens were there and left those misterious faces?"" Everyone was in gradual shock ready to hear the truth.  As Sally started to speak she started off talking about how people may think that aliens were the reasons we found these sightings on Mars. For years "
1679	studying venus is something that you would have to do 
1680	because you would take a sample of the planet and test it and you would have to see if theres oxygen on the planet and how many years the planet has lived and the arthor has made a story on how they would examine the planet like the NASA would have a little space craft thing that would hover over the planet so they could inspect the ground of venus and the planet could have temperatures around 170 degrees and the air pressure will be like sea level on earth but it could be survivable for humans. venus is a planet that has been around for hundreds of years and its known for the rings around the planet and it excees over 800 fehernhite and the air pressure would be 90 times greater then earth and it would be extreame than anyone has ever encountered on planet earth. the author wrote this is so readers would understand on how venus is and how people are studying it how many cool things are on the planet and other things like venus is called the ''evening star'' is because its the birghtest star even amature stargazer would see it. venus is the second planet from the star and its also named as earths ''twin'' because its second from earth and its earth terms of density and size its dangerous because no aircraft or spaceship has ever survived more than two hours on it. 
1681	every student learns differently, so if the computer changes the way the lesson is being taught based off of your emotion when maybe the lesson is already clear to you, could make it harder on some students. 
1682	Venus is the closest planet to earth in terms of density and size. Venus is a planet in the solar system, it is the second planet from the sun. It has proved a very challenging place to examine more closely. Venus is often referred to as Earth's twin, Earth, Venus, and Mars, our other planetory neighbor, orbit the sun at different speeds. a thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets venus. Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfric acid in venus's atmosphere.  The difference in speed means that sometimes we are closer to mars and other times to venus. Because Venus is something right around the corner in the space terms human have sent numerous space craft to land on the cloud-draped world. No space craft survived the landing for more than hours. Beyond high pressure and heat, venusian geology and weather present earthquakes, amd frequent lightning strikes to probes seeking to land on it's surface. Venus has the hotest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system, even though mercury is closer to our sun.  The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has one particular compelling idea for sending human to study venus. NASA's posible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of venus would allow scientists to float above the frays. Srriving to meet our challenge presented by venus has a big value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human currosity will likely lead us into manequally.             
1683	Here's why the author thinks Venus is a worthy pursuit because Venus could of once been a Earth like planet 
1684	Venus is same size in density, and size as Earth. The planet had rocky sediments, craters, valleys, and mountains. But nobody can visit or get a up close look to venus because it has a thick atmosphere of almost 97% carbon dioxide, highly corrosive clouds of sulfuric acid in its atmosphere. The weather is extremely hot the average temperature is about 800 degrees Fahrenheit. The atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than we are experiencing right now on earth this is stronger than any sea level on earth. If we were to have another pursuit to Venus it would not be efficient because we dont have the right equipment to survive on that kind of journey 
1685	Science can unlock and find a lot of new things and emotion is one 
1686	be happy and never hide you real emotion cause science will get you. 
1687	When the historical and famous picture that was taken of Mona Lisa famouse painting with her smiling can be a miss lead consuption or an unexpected photo at the time. With the FACS it was able to detect Mona Lisa's expression through the photo. She was 83% happy, 9% disgusted, 6% fearful, and 2% angry. 
1688	I feel like people would want to find out things more important like , whats going with that person , is the person feeling sick , is the person healthy . FACS could been about how's the day going to go , whats the weather going to be like 
1689	i think its dumb and i do not agree because its dumb no oneÂ likes extra stuff in school because its boring 
1690	extra activities are boring because its to extra because its extra and boring. 
1691	its boring just because its boring and no oneÂ likes it. just because noone likes it . extra activities are boring because its to extra because its extra and boring. its boring just because its boring and no oneÂ likes it. just because no oneÂ likes it . extra activities are boring because its to extra because its extra and boring. its boring just because its boring and no oneÂ likes it. just because no oneÂ likes it . thats all the reasons its boring and i think its boring because it is boring 
1692	because its better for u then school . 
1693	. if there gonna add a activity it should be for teachers to learn how to teach students 
1694	with a extra activity it makes no sense for that to happen. the principal would just be wasting his time because it would be nothing anyone likes because noone likes school so why have 1 extra thing that just makes no sense . 
1695	NASA  releasing it in the hopes while it was coming to public. To sale in stores and area in business ,and it did. Hoping it to be real so we can lead people into the existence of it being real. 
1696	Sadly for us as believers of life on other planets and creation of art from other living things. 
1697	Our nation could use Facial Action Coding system, It could better our nation a a whole, that we can dectect when a person is scared and angery, and upster. it could help, us at boarders, and when we let rugees come to our country, to see if they are actually here to be saved or here to hurt us, that way we can better as a country, and a nation 
1698	what can school childern do, we would all be constantly, have the disgusted, or have a sadness look on our faces 
1699	we should be able to pick and choose what's in our schools 
1700	we have to deal with whats goes on inside our schools, weather we aren't smart or not, we deserve that right, our parents, the law makers, dont know what we goes on in our schools, or how we feel about, the standard testing, why should be garde on stuff, our parents dont know, we shouldnt be forced on tests, that decides if we graduate. 
1701	So i say you should go and get a extracurricular activity it would be fun!  
1702	They use video imagery the software tracks the facial movements. The painted face of mona lisa by tweaking diffrent units the computer can identify mixed emotions. every expression is compared against a face, The demonstration could bring a smile to your face, for example. If you smile when a AD appears on your screen the computer will bring up another AD that is similar to the AD your looking at right now. But if you frown the next AD won't be the same. According to the facial feedback using your facial mucsles doesn't only express human emotion they also help produce them. 
1703	After reading this article, I have grown a nutreal side of this topic. The reason why is becuase I found a liking for the discovery, but there is also some things that I dislike as well 
1704	This tech can become useless and useful in many situations.  
1705	The author suggest the reader to study Venus isnt directly in the text but he/she gives you the idea that you should look into it. 
1706	Throughout the article the author talks about Venus and others planets in out solar system. but he mainly talks about Venus and Mars. 
1707	"The author tells us that Venus isn't actaully a Evening star, it just has that name because it is closer to the sun. Venus is also referred to as Earth's ""twin"" because it is the closest planet to us in density and size and sometimes distance. In the text it says ""Venus can be right around the corner in space'. Even though Venus is right around the corner we have still yet to land an actually spaceship on it. There hasn't been any space craft the a has been successfully on Venus for more than a few hours.. Although in paragraph 6 it says ''many researchers are working on innovations that would allow our machines to long enough to contribute meaning to our knowledge of Venus "
1708	This is tell us that there is still stuff to learn about mars and this story isnt complete.    
1709	the reason why their is the techonoly of people to know how to understand on how the reason the potrites are in this world today. By showing on how the way the pictures in the text is showing how she is smileing. 
1710	I think we should leave her face the way is orginally on the way it is from the way the arginol person painted it. It is being very respectful on how the painting is being displaied in different musemes here around the world. 
1711	the reason why I think this is because lets say that we painted something and someone goes in and paint it completely different. Than what you made it to be in the first place. So I feel like we all should leave things they were when they were created. The respect we give we get in return from the same reson y we gave it to others because the more you give the more it looks good on you in the long run. So just remember that the next time you see someone changing someone else's painting or others works. They work so hard on because why would they work so hard on somthing that someone else is just gonna go back in and change it.        
1712	and students have less time in their regular classes. 
1713	Having less time in their regular classes makes teachers also stress. Teachers have less time in class to teach students what they need to learn. Students learn less and goof more around in the activities. The grades of students could decreaseÂ badly because they are not learning enough. Also not all students are caught up in class and they would have less time in class to finish their makeup work. For example, some students do not show up to school and they would not have much time to catch up with the work that other students have finished in class. 
1714	Using technology to read student,s emotional expressions some student's are bored some sleeping and some stressing doing the test but the others are happy and working in the test averyone has the percent of the emotional.  taking about Eckman i classified some basic emotions too people now are bored, sleeping, stress, sad, and fear because they want to pass the test and do good this work everyone has something in hi's face.  The facial expressions shows some emotional like happy , anger ect.  every day we have differnt caract or diferent emotional feeling and i don't know how Monna Lisa can be really intended tom bring a smile for us face. i thonk i cant recognize how my best friend feeling is just lokking her eyes cause i know her i and I know when she is happy, sad, bored, confusedand fear, I think people show the feelings but some people can's see because they don't care about it. I think that techonology is a great idea for us or some people who want to know feeling about some people important in their life. I think every emotional has one special moment sometimes are not special but its life and we can't do something abou it. Sonetines we have mixed of emotions like the Monna Lissa. She look happy but at the same time serious. Her smile look like different she can't smile like us. The reson of that is now she is just a painting. Leonardo da Vinci's paint the Monna Lisa but he die that the reason she doens't have the aye browns and thats why she sook serious. That is the reason she look like with different emotional feeling cause she don't have eye browns and she look likr that. we can see the movements in the people face and we can take an idea of how they are or how feeling and emotional are the face show everything. My conclussion is everyone have different emotional but if we want to know their feeling or emotional we need to stay with that person we need to meet the people spend time with him/her we can't say oh I need that techonology to see my wife feeling or my husband felling or a fried I mean is a good techonology but we need to spend time with the person the techonology can't do everything to us. We have the option let the techonology do that for us or do that for people if we really care about his feeling or emotional. For me the better option is the second one meet the people and ask some question to show the special boy or girls they are special for me and i want know more about him. 
1715	I like how the techonology work but we need to do the staff for us. 
1716	It could make people happier. 
1717	And you can tell if it's a real smile by there muscular actions the cheek bones lift the corner of your mouth. But if you got a fake smile, the mouth is stretched sideways faces don't lie professors say.  
1718	"Imagine a computer thuat shows when you're happy or sad. If you smile when a web ab appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow. But if you frown , the next ad will be different. It could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor. ""The same technology can make computer animated faces more expressive- for videogames or video surgery most communication is non verbal ,including emotional communication so computers need to understand that too. "
1719	"Hold on we can actually ""calculate"" emotions-like math homework? And how can a computer recognize the subtle facial movements we humans use to express how we feel? The process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face ; all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles. Movements of one or more muscles is called an ""action unit"". "
1720	Venus exploration I can tell the author cares about venus by putting down many ways humans can exploer it 
1721	from going there he says it was very worthy of going we would just need a blimp like vehicle too hover over 30 miles above the land becuse the surface of venuse is very hot just in the blimp hovering over 30 miles would be 170 dagrees but where the blimp is sitting its at sae levels on earth. They are finding out ways too make electronics go onto venus because there is a lot of danger if we put a human on venus 170 dagrees is too hot for the human body unless they got the blimp at freezing tempatures the people inside will burn righht up blood will boil and people will get heat strokes. But if we put electronicson the planet that can survive the tempatures we might not have a problem with people being burned alive and we could actually exploer the lands of Venus we could make vheacles out of strong silicone for this mission it would be easier too make vehicle out of the stuff. 
1722	And so we can be apart of the school. Most the people that i know don't do affer school actiry and they have nothing to do when school is done. They could be doing sothing but no. So if we all did sothing affer school what woud it be. 
1723	in the passage it states UNRRA hires seagoing cowboys to take care of horses , young cows , and mules that were shipped overseas , Luke and Don signed up . The passage also states in August 1945 , they recieved their orders to report to New Orleans . They arrived August 14 which was the day pacific war ended . 
1724	The passage states when Luke's draft board learned that he was on a cattle boat , they told him to just keep doing that for his service . The passage also states Luke turned 18 before arriving in greece , which meant he could be drafted in military service 
1725	"The whole thing to the paragraphs and all the supporting details is that Don wanted Luke to be like him and asked him to sign up so they could be with eachother . They wanted to have good opportunities with eachother t, they wanted to grow up and become something just from being stated in the seagoing cowboy program . Like they say in the story at 18 before arriving in Greece you could be drafted in military . That right there means they wanted to be something like a star that everyone wants to meat or be important or be famous , because lots of times it gets boring sitting around all the time . They said "" hey lets get up and go sign up for something to become something together since we are close friends . ""            "
1726	If you are a parent and you child text saying they need you because they're not feeling well, have to text them back because they are not allowed to really use their phone in school so you can't call them. 
1727	Students work best when they can do their own project their way because , a lot of students dislike when the teacher want them to do a project their way and the project is about something they dislike doing , and the teacher have things set up their way . Students will also like to do they project on their own , so they can be more focused about what they want to do , not what the teacher wants to do . 
1728	that friend or relative could be really good in a subject or maybe something your not good at and they can help you with that subject or that one thing your not good at but they are . 
1729	"In the article ""The challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy to go explore from the dangers that Venus has. "
1730	In paragraph the author is describing how Venus was like a long time ago, covered with large oceans and that it could of have supported various forms of life. The author also describes how the planet looks like today with rocks, valleys, and mountains.  
1731	Paragraph six also talks about how researchers can't take any rocks, gas, or anything that is from Venus, to no make it a risk and researchers can't take pictures or videos that well because the light of the picture or video cannot penetrate the dense of the atmoshere which is ineffective. 
1732	"In the bottom of paragraph seven it says that "" Just imagine exposing a cell phone or tablet to acid or heat capable of melting tin "
1733	. By comparison, system that use mechanical parts can be made more resistant to pressure, heat, and other forces 
1734	I think that reseachers and scientist are learning more and more about humans going to Venus to see if it is safe to go.       
1735	Planing. Can the tecnologic read face of the emocion of human. Scientit are makeing computer to keeping growing u. The most comun expression is the paint of Mona Lisa Smile. This paint can be express the emotion of happy, sadness and same more. The computer can read your face with your own muscle.  
1736	"""Dr. Huang and his collenge are experts at developing better ways for human and computers to communicate"". The main computer are growing up to be able accepting human. In the past nobody know the real face of tecnologic. The scientits are proving evidents the human can comunite witha none human. In other way the expression to seem a emotion through a computer is complice to understand, but the reason to develop the tectologic is to understand the human.  ""She'83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry. It's the subject of leonardo de Vinci's Renaissance painting.""This argument can be decription of Leanardo's paint. The Mona Lisa Smile can be dectetive by a computer too. The way to decribe the same way. The happyness of the paint can tranfer us. She is happy but the same way to be happy is afear to do a mistake . The computer are showing work to be able to do it. The paint is the best work of Leonedo because is showing the real face of the human.  ""Yet Dr. Huang OBserves that artists such as da Vinci studies human anatomy to help them paint facial muscles precisely enough to covery specific emotions.""That way to identifies a reason to able read your face is the muscle. The way in each part of your face have a muscle that crear a feelinf acceptable. The face have a lot of muscle. The most muscle able to express is the smile. ""Empathy (feeling sameone else's emocional state) may happen because we unconsciously imitate another person;s facial expressions.""The next or side of the smile can show where is happyness. The term to asomeone accep you. Is the way to understand them first.  "
1737	In coclusion a computer are able to read your face. The computer are developing to a human understand themself. The first moment of your face can be good or bad. Well sametime are deficult ourself to able smeli or cry. To have affect is a great emotion to feel.      
1738	They would show you if your really happy or surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness by using the new technology that they built for you to see if you feel bad or anything you need to. now if you don't now already.  They might even make you look at youself in the mirror even if you don't really want to so you can see what you look like even if you really don't want to look at your face even though you look pretty.  If they make a paintting of you would keep beause you should it will make you have some feeling inside your body telling you that you are very pertty and you should be happy about it but if you think that you are very ugly then their is something wrong with you cause everyone is pertty in thier own ways even if you think your not. 
1739	"In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile,"" the author describes how the new technology called the Facial Action Coding System enables computers to identify human emotions, that's a really smart idea right?. The software can see your emotions, six emotions, and facial muscles.  First, the person who made this software was Prof. Thomas Huang, the Beckman institute fro Advanced Science at the University of Illinois who started to find better ways for humans and computers to communicate. The first subject he wanted to do was Leonardo da Vinci's Renaissance painting, Mona Lisa. Your maybe thinking how do u use a software just to find out how someone is feeling well...  In fact, the computer takes the model of the picture or what ever is there,but it must have human muscles in the picture ir 3-D model the human muscles is called ""acton unit"". It only takes in the model if it see's it have forty-four major muscles like a human would have. Dr. Huang and Dr. Paul Eckman has classified for the software to have six emotions-happiness,surprise,anger,disgust,fear, and sadness.  Dr. Thomas Huang and his worjkers or friends that helped him with the software made six basic emotins that the human muscles have and made it to where it only workd if it have the 3-D effect with fourty-four human facial muscles witch is every smart. "
1740	Venus is our sister planet. Some call us twins because of the sizes we both have. But, Venus is the closest to the sun like Mercury is the first panet next to the sun. So Venus is the warmer part of our sisterhood, and Earth are the cold part of our sisterhood. It's sort of like Venus is Anna because of her warm personality. And earth is like Elsa, because of her frozen powers, so she is extremely cold when it comes down to things. Earth at the moment is like Elsa because of its winter landish time of the year. 
1741	You should at least make some sort of suit that is safe for acid to hit it and so it doesn't melt your suit. It will be pretty cool to finally go to other planets and explore them. 
1742	For this entire essay I learned about new stuff. I learned that there is acid rain in Venus. There is a thick atmosphere of almost 97% carbon dioxide blankets Venus, I thought that was cool to learn. I also learned that Mercury is the first planet in front of the sun. I totally forgot about that, so I was surprised. So that's what I learned. 
1743	"The author of the article described Venus as Earth's ""twin."" "
1744	"The National Aeronautics and Space Administration also knon as (NASA) are studing the Venus the closest planet to our home, Earth. Venus is sometimes called the ""Evening Star"" because its one of the brightest points of light in the night sky, making it simple for even an amateur stargazer to spot "
1745	Striving to meet Venus is challenging But one challenge were willin to take 
1746	We can make the trip to venus but you cant even see it you will by flying over dense clouds and if you go under the clouds it's very hot 
1747	This article is abaut the platent of venus that are sometimes called Evening Star this is the secon planet from our sun,this planet is one that tje people can see from a large distance it has proved a very challenging place to examine more closely. this is the most dangerous for the people because the sun is like the fire the people can`t see and touch this in a short distance the sun and they light can be beautiful but is it most thing that is dangerous in the universe. 
1748	Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size ,and occasionally the closest in distance too, venus is a planet visit for the people,venus have many things that are interesting the people vistit this place for know somethings that they don`t know but they need know venus is one planet that are close with mart and earth venus is study for the humsn science.  A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon blankets venus. On the planet the temperatures average can be over a 800 degrees fahrenheit and the atmospheric pressure is like 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet,the conditions of the this planet can be more extreme than anything humans encounteron the planet earth venus is the only planet that have hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system,the other planet that are closer to the sun is mercury , beyond high pressure and heat.  Venusian geology and weather present additional impediments like erupting of volcanes powerful earthquakes and frequent lighting strikes to probes seeking to a lang on its surface. venus have nomerous factors that contribute reputation as a challenging platent for humans to study,despite its aproximity to us, venus should have a sulfuric acids in the venus atmosphera 
1749	In all of this we have a question Why are scientists even discussing further visits to its surface.? Venus is a fascinated planet for the astronomers because it may wellonce have been mthe most Earth like planet in the solar sytem venus is a planet know for the rocks and gas that there is.      
1750	Venus also is a worthy pursuit becuase the text states the temperature is 170 degrees and it states humans can survive on this planet. 
1751	In addition to not using your phone in an operating vehicle there are a few reasons on why you should. Well first off the driver should not be the one to hvsicallv use the ohone ut a resoonsi le ad It should. 
1752	Pharagraph 7 explains how Luke, a Seagoing Cowboy himself, was ready for this hard work mostly because he helped his aunt on her farm as a boy.  
1753	Do you think that we should have school activites? 
1754	I think we should 
1755	according to sports news website on collage sports, suggests that 25% of sports players in collage sports that train hard and keep lead to building skills that could help down the road and the other 75% of collage players that dont train hard and just sit around learn how to succed through failer. This means that the collage students that try their best are the one mostly building skills that will help them succed and the other 75% who dont try learn skills through not putting more work into it knowing what they need to try to improve on to become better. 
1756	according to a studies done at a Virgina univitsy, suggest that 83% of the kid in school that had join club or sports had found a hobby that they enjoy doing and the other 17% of the students that took a club or a sport didn't or could find an intrest in that subject of activities. this mean that students found new hobby that enjoy to do in school when they have tine to do it and the students that didn't find a hobby that they dont enjoy probably dropped out of the club or the sport they were in 
1757	"they sell the space for you car for $40,000 along with a home. The vauban people completed this in 2006 ,they said that this an example of a growing trend in Europe,The untile states and some where else are suburban life from auto use this is called ""smart planning"". "
1758	It is not value of ad pop ups from a computer to detect student or teachers emotion, it's not right 
1759	plus i think it's a watse of time to try and collect every emotion of evryone who uses a computer 
1760	cause at some point in time the people will start to get angry about the whole emotions crap and maybe get rid of them, they may like at first but one day their just gonna get rid of it.  
1761	"Like in the article it said ""how can a computer recognize the subtle facial movements we humans use to express how we feel?"" six emotions the computer has to track, ""happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness and then associated each with characteristic movements of the facial muscles."" "
1762	A computer that can sence and track muscle movement and emotions, kinda werid and freaked out to me if i had this computer and i think most people around the world would stick to just regular computers or laptops and not buy this emotional computer ad poping up crap. 
1763	I would think more than emotional computers, thinking more advanced or just regular old computers thats what i would do if i were creating computers.  
1764	I think we shouldn't nchange anything at all about computers 
1765	"if it's gonna lead to a riot or people rising up to the company because of the computers, ""we want regular computers back not the stupid emotional ones anymore!"" u know... i would do the same thing as well.            "
1766	The perks of this job would be the trip and if a cow dies of old age it is a steak cook out and you can see more animals you thought possible in a bout. The sea is a inportant part of the job and if you are scard of water then this job is not for you 
1767	To ensure that the projects don't get lost, students would have to think of ideas that would make the projects a blast to get though. Ideas like travelling the world and recording the experience could be trilling and get the gears turning in the students brains.  
1768	Venus has way more characteristics than Earth does. 
1769	The author stated how it is the hottest surface temperature, more powerful climate cahnges, more atmospheric pressure, etc. Venus is a unique planet. The author want us to invest more to Venus, because it has some features that are analogous to those on Earth. 
1770	Venus has dangers it despites, but can be so interesting to invest more on. The author thinks Venus may be the most earth-like plannet in our system. It is like Earth's 'twin'. So, if it's similar to Earth, why not look more forward to studying Venus. It is important to know what's surrounded in Earth.   
1771	Sports will make students to grow to strong and get lots of sunlight. Learning an instrument has been proven to make people smarter. But not just in music, in other curriculum too. Also there is a lotÂ of different clubs out there that can help people with getting jobs or just learn a hobbieÂ too. 
1772	The author also goes on to say how the more challenging the place is the more they examine more closely. Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size. The Earth and Venus aslo orbits the sun in different times so its harder to vist it. 
1773	A lot of the student body gets upset because the president promises something and it never happenes and then it turns in a big rivarly between everyone. We learn abut politics in our geography and i think the us as the student body shouldn't be worried about politics as much because then the student body will think that it is ok to do what the politics do and say. 
1774	I agree because allÂ students should do something fun and move around 
1775	I agree because students move around when playing sports 
1776	Most students that play in a team could play the sports that they like. You can start feeling healthy after a game of any sport, and students can enjoy the nature when there outside. 
1777	Students can help out with yearbooks, as a result they can design the front cover of the year book 
1778	Lots of students like art work from the front cover and will want a yearbook 
1779	Students can serve on students council which helps other students with disorders. 
1780	They will be appreciated in what they are doing for others and the rest of the students will be happy. 
1781	So, in conclusion, this artifact of mars is real. 
1782	It's really sad when you think about it, people have developed skills and strategies to make it look like they're not on the phone. 
1783	Some new computer softwar that recognize emotions. The software is the latest innovation from prof. New techology experts at developing better ways for humans and computers to communicate. But each expression is compared against a neutral face. But the computers can identify human emotions like happy, fearful, angry and sad.  The same technology can make computer-animated faces more expressive for video games or video surgery. To faces more expressive the can tell how the person feel sad, angey and happy. Also the video the people can play with friend in school or in online. When student are bored they can play video game and make their happy. The hospital use technology for video surgy. Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication. so computer need to understand that, too.  imagine a computer that knows when you happpy or sad 
1784	Technology can make thing better but some technology can make thing worse. 
1785	We all want keep a lot of thing to are self the face scan reading people emotional not right but if people something deep i feel like you should share because you can't hide a lot in things in life i feel like it the sametime we should and shouldn't have this face scaning emotional. 
1786	"I feel like people think it good to have for them self i feel like we should get it because a lot of human perform this impressive ""calclulation"" everyday because you can probably tell how friend is feeling simply by look on her face. "
1787	Would you every use technology to read students emotional?  Yes so i can tell how they are doing and if the feeling well or bad today i feel like students should show they feeling because we would know how i person feel intel they tell us. 
1788	I do still believe that students should design their own projects.  
1789	"Some students in the Twenty-First Century are not willing to learn about certain topics in school because of all the other amazing internet resources and games they think are part of computer freedom, but inspite of Three- Dimentinal vision, Mona Lisa could have been much angrier than what she might have seemed like in her face, and she might have been fearful because of her hair style and her looks ""in the dark!"" Maybe, there was a possibility that a demostration of Mona Lisa could test how well with a(n) computer with ""2020 Vision Software"", or have a(n) emotional sensor flashdrive to attach to your PC Engine when you want there to be certain conducting over feelings from your computer technology "
1790	I think that this kind of technology is kind of un-realistic, but it would be a good source for what the person studying in will thinks about what he learned in the past 
1791	"""Once enough of the Life-Story of the person has gone by."" "
1792	"I would imagine that constructing a computer that has a lot of functions and features could lack the knowledge of a person's understanding of how to ""USE"" the computer properly, which will turn out to be more like ""TRASHWARE"" than ""SOFTWARE"" "
1793	"The biggest part I think the Facial Action Coding System ""Is Worth"" is how you can just control anything in your ""IMAGINATION"" to discover the strong ways that you can make video games from your imagination, show how you truly feel, and picture yourself "" in that video game."" Dr. Huang is not a bad ""Pre- Innovator"", but he could have added specific date(s) to his context. "
1794	"In Vauban, Germany residents have given up their cars. In this expeirimental community, street parking, driveways, and garages are almost forbidden. Car ownership is however allowed, but the only place to park are large garages at the edge of the development. If you own a car and decide to park there, you must buy a space for $40,000, plus a home! The outcome of this has been most of the community don't own cars. ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way"" this was said by Heidrun Walter, mother of two and a media trainer. Also this communities idea has been adopted around the world. "
1795	In this article or passage the author idea was to explore venues more find out what are it values. because if earth would suffer a damage of nature venues would be the only safe place for humans 
1796	but first of all water got to be in venues in other for human to stay a live why because us the human ca not live without whater why because we need it to drink it also we need it for our crops to grow an give us fruits and vestables for our food. scientist think that onces there was water in venues if fresh air could be infume by humans there's could be a chage that human would survive out of space in a different planet. scientist are peeking over venues to get rock samples also air sample to see the enviroment values on fact about venues is that is one of the closets plate to the sun which means that the climate there is going to be high cause the planet being clos to the sun and that why we need water in venues cause of it's high temperatures humans would be thirsty for water. 
1797	we can see how student are feeling and to see if they are having a good day or a bad day 
1798	in a way did making a happy face make you slightly happy in the artical it tells us by making a happy face your muscles not only expresses emtions but they will also may even help produce them 
1799	I would like to talk to you about car-free cities it is about 70 percent of vaubans families do not own cars and another thing about this article is tat 57 percent sold a car to move to german and that in 2006, the united states was to seperate suburban life from the auto as a componenet of traveling and another word for hat is smart planning. and a most important fact is that 12 percent of the greenhouse gas emissions in europe is up to 50 percent in some car -intensive areas in the united states .and in 1950 percent in the town of levittown are still exert a strong appeal.  next, in paris ban driving due to smog and it talks about almost 4,000 drivers were fined,according to an international news agency headquartered in london. And the gas prices for diesels make up 67 percent of vehicles in france, compared with 114 in brussels and that 79.7 in london reuters found. and the next reasn is that 53.3 percent average of diesel engines in the rest of western europe, according to reuters. and that it was the third straightÂ  year cars have been banned with only busesÂ  and taxis permmited for the day without cars in this capital city of 7 milllion. the goal is that to promote aletrnative transporation and reduce smog. and faced of a fine of $25 fines. and in april in 2013 the number, of miles driven per person was nearly 9 percent below he peak and equal to where the country was in january 1995. because, cash- strapped americans could not afford new cars now. and that now that they recoverd is under way.Â  the next few years will be telling. what most intrigues me is that rates of cars ownersip per household and per person started to come down two to three years before the downturn. next reason is that a study last ear found that driing by young people decresased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009. and that at an initial stage begginning to happen or they develop. and that a famous street in paris and that car traffic  
1800	My claim for this story is people are trying see how are people feeling in a picture and trying to hdie thir emotions 
1801	"My quote from the story is ""Imagine being able to dectect exactly how other people are feelings, even when they are trying to hide their emotions.  Mona Lisa is in the picture, she 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry. At some schools there are some computers sofware that can recognize emotions but not all of them. Dr. Huang is terying to find better ways for humans and computers to communicate. they are suing alot of techology to find how are people emotions in the picture. I know when people lok at a picture people wanna know how are that person is feeling in that picture.  Dr. Huang is putting the computer constructs in 3D and trying to put 44 muscles in the model must move like human muscles. Eckman has classified six basic emotions like happiness, suprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. when your in a picture your going to have some type of face expression. It all depends on what type of face that the person in the picture is looking like. Even your mouth can depend if your face expression is good or bad by tighting your lips to show anger.  When your round people you can tell their face expression just by the look of their face. A lot of us would have trouble actually describing each facial trait that conveys happy. And their face expressions can depend on how their hair looks. If their hair looks all over the place its probably bad and if their hair looks all nice its probably happy. "
1802	My conclusion is to find someone feelsing is look ing at their face and their hai and how their face looks. Just like actors be doing reproduce smilling and frowning. Moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions, but also may even help produce them. Whoever thought that making faces could reveal so much about the science of emotions.  
1803	There has been more and more people wanting to study this because of the fact that this one day might become another earth that we can live on and form some type of life on there but people have to test it out to see if we are able to live there for example to see if any animal life form can live there or even start bringing other to Venus for some testing. 
1804	I am also in an extracurricular activity, 
1805	This painting is was made a long time ago. Many people found this painting weird because, back then there wasn't a lot of people happy, also poor. So when you see this picture this girl is happy and looks like she has nice cloths on. People took this picutre into inspiration. And brought a lot to the picture. 
1806	In my perceptative I like this idea but then I don't 
1807	It is pretty nice that we have a software that can be able to do something like this. it is pretty cool to tell people that we need a picture of you or someone and we will see how happy you are, how mad you are, etc. But I'm really not for it that much. There can be more things we can do instead of doing this. But doing this picture was preety cool. 
1808	In paragrpah 5 it states that people can tell how your friend is feeling simply by the look on their face. I totally agree with it 
1809	If this is your best friend and they are the same to you when you see each other you should smile. But when they don't and still look down then you know there is a problem. Friends are there for each other. 
1810	In my mind i think i can tell how a person is feeling. 
1811	If they are dicustuing or just p a place you dont want to goto. Then it also solves the basic stuff like make face detecting how people fell about some presidents andit can solve cases if a person was happy or he was mad to tell if a person was a killer or not 
1812	has different speeds 
1813	"Venus is oftened referred to as Earth's ""twin"". Earth and Venus orbit different speeds. "
1814	These conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth. Venus does not have any easy conditions since it's dangerous but survivable for humans. Venus would need to get up close and personal despite the risks. 
1815	Brock was walking in the woods along the creek. At the edge of the water, he saw something that made a body type figure. Brock went down to see if it was a body, but when he got down there, it was really hard to see if it was a body because of the running water. He went back up to where he saw the body, and he coud see it clearly again. He took a picture of the body figure and sent it to the Elkart County Lab. They went to take a look at it and they posted the picture sent from Brock online. Most of the people who saw it, including some of the scientist, thought it was some sort of alien figure. They dug it out and found it to be a rock formed into a body shape by the shadows of the water, and the erosion that has been done to the rock 
1816	The likeness face of a human most of been a rock formation as said in the article or a landing of an spacecrft or even from a take off but there so no such thing as aliens that would do that or they don't even exists. 
1817	They even mentioned in the artilce how the cameras on board of MGS had to peer through wispy clouds to see the face clearly 
1818	Which were not likely it could of been the air,because the human like face was located in the north martian latitude where it was already winter. It could of been the breeze from the snow. 
1819	The picture that was taken in 2001 was more bigger and more proseize on what we would of been looking at then it was in 1976. The picture that was taken in 2001 made people see that there was nothing to worry about and that it was just a rock looking like a face. People even made it famous without knowing what it was at the time but then people saw the picture takened in 2001 that they had nothing be afraid of or suprised. 
1820	Having th advantage of source the population with no more cars is what i would have done. 
1821	With more people driveing behind the wheel what would happen next if you step on that road to get across while a person is driving behind th wheel over 90 miles an hour. 
1822	Its rough trying too get scool in the morning know what will happen when that person is behind the wheel. A deer might jump in the way while it just got done eating its meal. Scary is what i will say it really is when you are in a situation like that once in your life. 
1823	Cars a effecting our population with death of people and gas and fuel that is blowing out of the rough with expenses. Prices that is excending to others minds is that is becomeing higher thatn i can ever imagine it comes and goes like in a blink of an eye you would even think it was gone until somebody told you it was. 
1824	Video games are mostly the freedom of choice for most people . And emotional communication will still need to wait for technology to advance. Who is even gona use this. People do not caare what think about us the students. Making privat lessons based on our faces isn't a good idea. Many bad culd use this software to invade privacy from others. 
1825	And this is my reasons why I think this software sucks and should never be used 
1826	"So ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" is a great little short story that includes very interesting facts a "
1827	That's not even half of it either in other words let me give you some knowledge that I have gained from this wonderul author. 
1828	And this is where I'll tell you about the why scientists are still discussing further visits to the planet, 
1829	"so it say's in ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" that it once long ago may have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system then also Venus still today has a surface of rocky sediment besides that includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters fun fact Venus is called our ""Sister Planet"".  "
1830	"Finally for this conclusion I will just voice my own opinon about the short story on ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" the thing I liked about the story is that it wasn't that hard to break everything down in to a little essay but besides that it was good and very informational story. I loved it!   "
1831	I think the answer will be: yes, the computer they can read students' emotional.  
1832	this invention could fix so many problems that we have today. 
1833	First, the author despite the dangers that venus can be the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater then earth atmospheric pressure. Not one spaceship has survived the landing no more than a couple hours. 
1834	"The text states "" it was 1945 world war II was over in Europe,and many contries where left in ruins. The text also states that "" to help these countries recover their food supplies, animals, and more 44 nations joined together to form UNRRA "
1835	"the details from the article that supports lukes claims are "" Helping out on his aunt katie's farm as a boy prepared luke for hard work. ""But not for the dangers at sea"". "
1836	having a set of eyes on the road is still better than none at all. 
1837	"In Germany, residetns have given up on cars. Vauban's streets are completely ""car-free"", except the main throughfare, where the tram to downtown Freiburg runs, and a few streets on one edge are only two places to park.  70 percent of Vauban's families do not own cars, and the 57 percent sold a car to move there. Some say they feel happier now than before when they had a car. Automobiles are the linchpin of suburbs, where middle-class families from Chicago to Shanghai tend to make their homes. Greenhouse gas emissions are reduced drastically. Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe, and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the U.S.  In the new approach to make cities denser, and better for walking stores are being placed a walk away, on a main street, rather than in malls along some distant highway. In teh U.S., the Enviornmental Protection Agency is promoting ""car reduced"" communities, and legistors are starting to act, if cautiously. In previous bills, 80 percent of appropriations have by law gone to highways and only 20 percent to other tansport.  After days of near record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city. Almost 4,000 drivers were fined, according to Reuters, an international news agency headquartered in London; 27 people had their cars impounded for their reaction to the fine. Cold nights and warm days caused the warmer layer of air to trap car emissions. The smog cleared enough Monday for the ruling French party to rescind the ban for odd-numbered plates on Tuesday.  President Obama's goal to curb the U.S.'s greenhouse gas emissions, unveiled last week. Recent astudies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by. Pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and improve safety.    "
1838	Forcing student to participate in something that effects them negatively is wrong, and should never happen, ever. Being in the negative can be good sometimes though, for example when you have negative twenty-one fires burning your house ( No fires burning your house) or when your electricity bill is a negative (that means they owe you money). But in most cases being in the negative is NOT a good thing, like extracurricular activities. Negatives and after school activities don't mix because all that happens is more negative things. A negative plus a negative is not a positive, its more negatives. So in the end you have to understand that extracurricular activities are wrong, and not OK. 
1839	The quote is saying is event though our planet can mealt things Venus can mealt is a lot faster than Earth can.  
1840	The test is saying even though Mercury is the closet planet to the sun Venus has the highest preasure and heat and Benusin geology and weather presents additional impendiments like valcanos, earthquakes, and freguent lighting so it? hard for scienetist to land rockests on Venus. 
1841	There is no way to know how someone is feeling unless you are them.  Many people pretend to be happy. If you have depression you are prone to act happy even if you are not happy. Happiness comes from love, yes many can tell when their friend is upset thatÂ´s because they are close to them and know how they act. But just because you think you know how someone feels doesnÂ´t mean you really know.  If you have a disease or some type of physical trait many donÂ´t have then you may look different then others. Every human is different in many ways. No one on earth has the same face unless you are a twin but then but then it still doesnÂ´t justify the fact whether or not some one is happy. If you have downs syndrom you look happy all the time but that doesnÂ´t mean you are. 
1842	A computer can not tell your emotions because a computer does not have emotions 
1843	just because your facial muscle structure is a certain way can not determin your mood. Many scientists say putting on a happy face can actually help your emotions grow and develop. If you always have a happy face on then you will usually always be happy, that is not true. The Mona Lisa is one of the worlds most nutorious pieces of art. The Mona Lisa is set apart from much art only because of one reason and that reason is the woman is smiling.  pieces of art from the 16th century until the early 20th century did not have smiling. I am not sure why many did not smile maybe it was easier to paint humans withouts smiles. No one for sure knows if that woman was actually smiling except the girl and Da Vinci himself. The world always wants to improve and make changes and but the world is different we all face different struggle sand have different emotions you cannot put a label on a personÂ´s emotions.    
1844	The folllowing details and information will be informing you exactly why scientists and theorists are having different opinions about the peculiar face. 
1845	Have you ever through of somethig simple in life like studying venus. 
1846	"Venus still has some features than the other planet on the earth and because most of people called it ""Evening star."" "
1847	""" The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" because they are worthy pursuit some condition. "
1848	They are price etc. we need to buy gas,sample of rock. The scientists seeking conduct a through mission to Venus would need personal despite to risks himself it is a danger place. They are such conditions are far more extreme than anything humans on the Earth. As we know that Venus has teh hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system, even though Mercury is closet to our sun. 
1849	When we talk about planet it is about Education 
1850	An environment or our surrounding would crush even submarine accustomed to diving because some of them they are so deepest parts o the Ocean and it would be quality of life. Education it based on everything we study like etc. Earthquakes,Volcanoes ,Venus, Mars,. Numerours factors contribute to Venus's reputation as a challenging planet for humans to study , despite its proximity. A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus.  
1851	The article is about venuse that some time called be the Evening star. 
1852	Venus is actually a planet in the oue solar system. is on the brightest point of light in the night sky. It is the closest planet to the earth. and occasionally the closest in distance like Earth, Venus, and Mars, the other neighboer orbit the sun at different type of peeds mean that sometimes we are closer to Mars and the other timer to the Venuse. We as a humans have sent numerous spacecraft to the land on cloud draped world. Venus reputation as a challenging planet for the human to be study by despite its proximity to us.  `The 97 percent carbon diocide to a thck atmsphere of almost venuse. The planet surface temperatures average was over 800 degrees Fahrenteit. The atmospheric pressure 90 timer up graster the other planrt. venus has the most hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solae system. Venusian geology and the weather temperatures present additional impedimente-s like ower earthquakaker, they can kill people or make people sick. sacientists even discussing further to it surface, Astronomers are fascrinated ny the venus becanuse once have themost Eath like long ago. Venus still has some features that are analogous to those on Earth.  NASA has one particulartarly compelling idea for swending human to study Venus as possible has the solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of venuse thta wopuld allow scientists to the float above the fray. air pressure would be close to that of sea level on Earth.  Venus is from a ship orbiting that safely for above the planet can porvide only limited on the ground of condition because most form of the light cannot penetrate the dense.  venus surface and have lasted fir three weeks such conditins. these devices were the first envisioned in the 1800s and plaed am important role in hte 1940 during world war ll.  travelesls on Earth could be had but beyond should not be limeited the dangers thing that is happen should dould be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation.              
1853	So I'm gonna go ahead and tell you why I think this is why I don't think it is a human at all.  
1854	The face structure hasn't changed any of those pictures. 
1855	If it was human, in a couple of months or years (maybe), your body becomes rotton and turn into nun but bones. If it was human, then it would have body parts along side with it. There's no body parts near it except rocks and holes. Besides, the picture look like it was taking from a pretty far distance for the head is bigger then that boulder next to it. 
1856	The fact that I know that it's not a face, notice how by years go by, the face starts looking like an sand temple 
1857	The thing with it is that on the top of it, it looks like another face on it, like a rebuilded electronic robot. But, when 2001 came by, it started looking like an a map or a super hard shell. All of these things that were on Mars looks different by the years. Now, in 2016, I bet it looks like a guided map to wear it started to wear it landed at. 
1858	"I want to believe that there is life on Mars, but the thing is that Mars ""probably"" have alien's there. As no one has thought about it, alien's could be legit. Just because we see a face on Mars means one thing, but the fact that it's whole entire bottom half of it's neck-to-bottom part is gone. Just because it changed up doesn't mean,""Oh, it must have cleared up since it's been there for a while"". I doubt that because, no human being can walk on Mars with no protection on that can keep him/her alive. If your going to Mars, make sure you need a quite bit of protection. But, if you actually do see an alien, just run, because it's best staying alive instead of wind up dead in the middle of no were on Mars. "
1859	"""Luke heart race as he shot feet first toward and opening on the side of the ship. Luke was happy to beon board, especially when he return trips after the animals had been unloaded. He was happy to be alive, but he coudn't work for a couple of days because of his cracked ribs. "
1860	The hands free law can affect you in a positive or negative way. 
1861	Back in the day they did'nt have technology. They telephone to call they friends and mother & father. They couldn't not even go outside to see they friends they mother where so hard on them. Some would let them go over there friend house to have fun. Some had to stay home and clean up cook dinner and watch there little sister and brother didn't get to go nowwhere what to ever. It was a time they had to be in the house a certain time before the street light come on. Now, Parent letting there kids do what ever they want now. Now, They have internet, phone now, facebook, snapchat & twitter. Agnry on social media over boy and want to fight peolpe no reason. A bullying peolpe cause they look better den other people. Peolpe killing there self cause peolpe bullying. It a lot peolpe killing there self in different city and state for being pick on. And kids have so much anger on there self. Some peolpe need make a progra for these kids that has anger problem and wanna hurt there self. Some kids don't have mother and father they have to foster care. Till somebody take them in till there hand to peolpe there parent. Some teenger will live with there boyfriend insted of there father and mother. That you will have happiness, 
1862	surprise,anger,disgust, fear, and sadness on your self. And then associated each with characteristic movement of the facial muscles in your body. Some peolpe bring you down you have to get back up and stay in a good ways. Some classroom computer - animated faces move expressive- for video games or video surgery. Meanwhile, muscles called orbicularis oculi pars palpabraeus make crow's - feet around your eyes. The expert, faces don't lie; these muscle clues are sometimes used to spowhen a smiling politician or celebrity isn;t being truthful. Whoever thought that making faces could reveal so much about the science of emotions. 
1863	at least thtats my opinion but really something like that just seems like a huge waste of money we dont come to school to talk about our emotionsn we come to school because we need to learn and make new friendsand thats why i think a device that can read emotions is a huge wasste of money. plus it sounds pretty worthless if you ask me if you wanna know if someone is sad or not just ask us and we should answer its that simple theres no need to build something that complicated when you can just ask them youself theres really no need for something thats that complicated also what about mona lesa smileing thay said they needed that to discover if were smiling good to i think we can tell if someone is smiling and if someones isnt so yeah 
1864	Luke Bomberger was join to the program because his friend invine to go to Europe on cattle boat Luke could not say no because they are best friend and if he say no his friend would be sad. So he was joinn to cowboy. In 1945 there was a would war 2 in Europe and manu countires were left in ruind. To help theis countries to bring them food,supplies,horse,cow, chicken and mules to help to survine.  Luke clains is that he go on the boat and left it took them to past the pacific ocen.  The body is that Luke made it to china so they play game and have fun and they go the mules and cow they was happy and in china they got food for them and there family is very happy and some people does have a home and they build home for them and some people got hert and they lost there family and they are realy sad and they are thankful that they are alive and Luke filled bad for them because they don't any home then Luke went back to his home and he was happpy.  
1865	"The author says, ""studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents."" "
1866	Instead, focus on another planet that is well worth the time and money of a spacecraft. It would only take moments for the spacecrafts to be liquefied after standing on Venus's surface. Spending more time on a different planet that has an atmosphere and geological features similar to earth would be ground breaking for science and especially NASA. 
1867	In April 2013 the number of miles driven per person was nearly 9% below the peak and equal to where the country was in January 1995. Many sociologists belive it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the enviroment since transportation is the second largest source of americas emisions just behind power plants. programs are suggesting that people use other methods of tranportation. which is cool, i guess?Â  Different things are suggesting that we are converging and witnessing a long term cultural shift. Car pool apps, center of cities makes suburbs less appealing. im not even trying anymore with this essay,Â  people are connecting in other ways than meeting up. nobody is caring anymore about this essay. just typing. in columbia its the 3rd straight year that cars have been banned. blah blah blah. goals are to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. nobody cares, lets talk about something else. 
1868	Advantages about limiting car usage. Really? I dont care about german suburb life without cars and i dont ever intend to care about it. i am a proud owner of a car and i dont want to live a life without it. This prompt is so unrelatable, mainly because  I OWN A CAR!  Maybe if i didnt i would be able to undertand this a little more but this is so ridiculous that i have to sit here and take time away from my education to write about cars. Im not even into cars. i dont care that people decide not to use cars, good for them, but i do use a car on a daily basis. im so over all of this excessive testing. Cars are pretty and nicely air conditioned, and shiny. They get you where you need to be quickly and you can jam out while on the way there. I hate essays, they are obnixious and boring. this is all a huge waste of time and i wish i just stayed home like some of the other kids in this class so that i wouldnt have to take this. Cars can be a nice way of driving around in money bags and showing everyone that you can afford this unnessacarily large vehicle that will sit in the hot room connected to your house, that also has a tempature very similar to hell. Honestlty your probably a really nice person who got stuck with the unfortunate job of reading all of these essays and grading them. You should be paid more because this just sucks, and im not even the one who has to read them all. You need to quit and go find some passion in your life. Take a painting class, or go watch the sunrise, you shouldnt be here reading all of these dumb essays that will never benefit my future or yours. 
1869	please go find a passion because you cant keep doing this and wasting your life away. Go water some plants, and make your bed, or make another persons bed. Just do somethign else other that sit here and read a bunch of essays that a essentially meaning less. You need something more in life and i do as well 
1870	One why in the world would you want to know soemones mood you dont know what they were going threw thats history hwat they were feeling let the past stay in the passed 
1871	not alot of people wanna know why she was sad this isnt from the artlicle nobody cares about why she was sad or happy leave her be what kind of test is this who the heck is gunna ask you what the heck happened in the passed its the passed it should stay there nobody in the world is gunna ask you what mood was mona lisa in in the picture who the heck cares its in the passed i didnt have to go into the artlicle to know this is stupid make fun of me if you please if someones reading this sure if its the computer when what the heck computer slide me a dub on this test me and you both know this isnt something will be asked in the future honestly tho who cares this is nonsense whos to really know if u were happy or sad or the picture was actually there to make u smile thats like me saying im here to be loyal then say im gunna cheat instead. you were not there to say that it was there for that one certin purpose no personal information but me and my girl arent together so that isnt my girl so i could lie and say she cheated or i can tell the truth n say she left cus i wasnt making her happy 
1872	it was 1995, world war ll was over in europe, and many countries were left in ruiens to help these countries you woiuld need to send many,many us army troops out to save them from all of that stuff ,like rocks that might have fallen on them and other stuff that might have harm them or others in there country ,luke was 18 before arriving in greece with means he could dafted for the military services when my draft board learned that i was. on cattel boat trip they told me just keep doing what i was, doing for my service the cattel boat trips were amazing for a small town boy like luke , he could learn. new things it was almost like he was a tourest when luke was helping out katie that was his aunt she owned a farm as a boy luke was hard working and brave but the sea's were , to dangerous for luke he could not handle it the first couple of days luke was happy with his job but as it got harded luke got more sad and unhappy with his job but being sea going cowboys was too much fun there was much mor to it thsn just having fun .                          
1873	it can provide extra learning opportunitie 
1874	increase physical fitness 
1875	improve student social skills 
1876	Scientists have been studying Venus for generations, wondering what could possibly be on a planet so close to ours. Now that we don't have to wonder anymore, NASA will try to take it one step higher. They want to be as close to Venus' ground as possible, without dying.  
1877	My honest oppinion on this topic is that we should not be exploring Venus right now. We just don't have the right technology for it right now. 
1878	Nobodies computer can hadle the complex algortihms used to decode Mona Lisa's smile but they can come up with soemthing to decode different emotions. 
1879	"For example my first evidence that i found in this article is when said that ""Mona Lise is 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry"". So, is trying to tell us that to making Mona Lise smile can be a difficult way, because she had too many differents emotions at the same time,but nothing is impossible. But also the people trying to describe a new technology to identify humans emotion. The new technology is called FACS ( Facial Action Coding System). This is the new technolody that the author wanted to used to find the humans emotions, , and see which one of the two option that they had can be more easy or more faster to find the human emotions.  My other example that also i found in this article is when said that ""according to the new computers softward can recogniza emotion. The softward is the least innovation from Prof. Thomas Haung, of the Backman institute for advanced science at the University Illions."" The author is trying to tell us to describes the new tecnology was little complicated because with he wanted to describe that technology to see if will be more easy to identify the emotions. Also in this article said that the process begings when the computer construct a 3D computer of the face, all 44 muscles in the model must move like human muscles. That why i think that describes that new techology wasn't eassy because the new technology need to identify all about human. "
1880	In my conclution is about the computers and how Mona Lise demostration was really intended to bring a smiles to your face, while it show you just how the computers can do. If you smile when a Web ad appears to your screen , a similar somputer could regnize too. Like said Dr. Haunght he predicted that the computer could recognize when a students or another person is becoming confused or sad. And acording to the Facia Feeback theory emotion, moving ourfacaisl muscles can make us feel not only expresss motion, but also can even help us to feel like some differents emotions. 
1881	First and formost, the evening star, is the brightest point in the sky. Venus also makes it simple to stargazing. Venus is the second planet and the next closest plant next to earth. 
1882	The challenge to explor Venus is becuse Venus is the second planet from the sun so it is to hot to go to do to how close the sun is to the planet. 
1883	If you go on the planet you will git to hot to fast and the space sute will malte off of you and if the space sut melt off you will die becuse thare is no oxigen in space the space sute is the onley thing that is keeping you alive. And so that is way we can. Got to Venus quiet yet it will haping in the fucher. In the fucher we mite find some stroger miterole to build better sute and bettre space ships becuse the space shipe we have now cant withsand the heat of Venus the ship wuid melt do to the heat of being so cloes to the sun. The plant venus is not sutibole to land on do to how hot it is the planit venus has 97 percent carbon dioxide covering Venus. Carbon dioxide is not good to brething in it will kill you if you breat to much in. Do to how deadley it is scpaeman have the space sute to keep the alive if thay did not have it thay wood die do to lacke of oxigun but the spacesut has oxigun in it to keep the ware alive. After the spaeman are dont in space thay go back to the spaestasin ware that have oxugine to brethin and that do what they need to do. 
1884	some students probably dont want their faces to be be modify or sometimes some students dont have no emotions like in the article it says ''The facial expressions for each emotion are universal,'' observes Dr. Huang, ''even though individuals often show varying degrees of expression'' this means that the someone probably have little emotions or expression in their face. In classrooms students who are bored show it mostly with body language which makes the face change expressions if the lesson is boring 
1885	Extracurricular activities are a great option 
1886	How would they survive and humans can not. In paragraph nine it discribes how hard it was to even get a picture of this face. If its very hard to get a good glimpse of this image. Its going to be struggle to live and be active on Mars as well. This has to be a natural landform that happens to looks like a face. If someone really did this, they would want credit and all the fame for all their hard work and i think we would have spotted them all ready. 
1887	There may have more then one landform that was very close. It so happened to make an image. Its very facinating how natural Earth funtionings can make something so exciting. If you have an imagaination its like the earth has its functions and feelings. Like the weather and natural things like landforms that form 
1888	I am sure there are some upsides to this 
1889	but it really just feels like an invasion of the students privacy. 
1890	These are my reasons why I agree with my principal.Â  
1891	The author has different details and has found them. 
1892	If you don't know none of these details you can search stuff online. 
1893	It's also good knowing these stuff because it's better to know them. 
1894	Scientists do a lot of researching that's going around the world and earth. Also Venus is worthy to know what dangercan happen. It can get to 170 degrees Fahrenheit the air will be close to the area. 
1895	The solar power would be plentiful, and radiation would not exceed earth levels. Also says in paragraph 5 that's not easy conditions, but survivable for humans. Venus from a ship orbiting or havering safely far above. There is different facts about everything. 
1896	For the last paragraph it should be about how the world is working now. In paragraph 8 striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus. There should be limits by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination. Imagine exposing the cellphone and all that. 
1897	The argument that isn't even factual.  You are going off of a guess in your mind. 
1898	well apparently some schools are thinking about having students do at least one extracurricular activityÂ after school. They also they might force kids do activities that there not interested in to get used to the real world. 
1899	The face is a natural landform because aliens are not rule. 
1900	Well aliens can be rule if someone makes then and sand them off somewhere but not the point. 
1901	"The ponit is "" the face on mars."" Yes it can be created by an alien if them were rule but there not so it maens one thing the face on mars is a natural landform. NASA can be making it up to like they can go up to mars and put the ""face"" were it is or something can move it. NASA can do something like that but I hlop they didn't.  The face on mars could also be from someone going up tp mars and on one knowing but someone would have seen it go up. All I need to say is i think it is a natural man made landfrom or a natural landform. Bad new is no one will know wath happen or how it was made. "
1902	These are just two of many ways we can limit our car usage.Â     
1903	Besides, what if we get to make friends with aliens? 
1904	Some people around the world think things like this would be great to brag about 
1905	As I read more not all the people were ok with the problem 
1906	Seems that scientists had found more. If I were a scientist I would gather evidence and all my documents from things that were related to this previous sitiuation. 
1907	It would be amazing because as a scientist you should always check for yourself. If you did a previous report on that planet or subject I think you should bring your old evidence and documents out to make things come together to understand better. 
1908	The author does prove some interesting points about the planets terrain and how we could work to develop technology for it. 
1909	While they use counter arguments to violent conditions on the surface of the foreign planet, such as the idea of solar energy to use the powerful radiation. The author definitely knows what they are talking about, and sounds like they have some experience in debate. 
1910	Those two statements counter each other due to the question of how we would get a material that can't melt in order to build safety equipment. 
1911	After all would you decide to help out and figure out more about Venus? Scientist are doing a great job so far with everything they are figuring out about what could be more helpful to them. They also know that is can be safe for them to hover over Venus instead of landing on it and having a horrible tragidy. 
1912	They have a lot of leads of what they can use and lets hope he can find more out about Venus in a couple of years. 
1913	the only bad thing is that when they have children they are going to have to buy cars so they can beable to take their children were they need to get to like school or some kind of sports practice 
1914	the intrigue of having a car is slowly degenerating. 
1915	Now on my personal life I will say that the technolngy will help me by seeing how are people feeling 
1916	"""While looking in the mirror "" By looking in the mirror can't really explain or say what's are emotion are becuase mirror don't speak and it doens't tell your emotions. People use mirro just becuase they want to see what's on their face or if it's dirty or what, how they look before they go somewhere. Mirror just copying what were doing in front of the mirror like if you start talking ofcorse your twin face in the mirror also gonna start talking too,becuase mirror is just a piece of a glass that can't describe what's people's emotion. Mirror can copy what were doing but can't say what are emotion or feeling. "
1917	The same technology can amke computer-animated faces more expressive for video games or video surgery because of of human is nonverbal, including emotional communication. Dr. Huang said computer should understand that too becuase its really hard and different. 
1918	In 1976 Viking 1 took a photo of formations on mars. The picture looked like a face so the people of the world thought oh my god. Aliens invaded mars and they will invade us run 
1919	Others might be that they could be doing just to waste your time 
1920	Personally if I want to do something I'm gonna do it but I'm not gonna waste your time but other kids don't ever think about that. 
1921	Most people that I have seen have got into something just to say that they are in not because they want to help they, just want to make their selfÂ look good and thats not OK. We can't always force someone to do something they dont want to do. 
1922	hey guys this is tyler, i'm a reporter, 
1923	today i'm going to give you three reasons why it's a challenge to explore venus. 
1924	"it's the second planet away from the sun but it is also considered our planet, earth's, ""twin"" among other things the reason why it's considered our second planet is for density and size also distance. "
1925	One reason why schools should use facial action coding system because it can be use full for health classes 
1926	health classes effect how much your emotions affect your body for example if you're always depressed you'll have a chance that your body might suffer from something and you might have a hard time to bring your body to stay strong again after suffering from depression and if your always happy you won't have a problem. 
1927	My Second reason why schools should use facial action coding because a day on a test. A day on a test you'll have a emotion that you don't wanna take it or just too lazy to do the test 
1928	The Evening Star give us the brightest light because it's too close to the Earth. Venus has more power of light than other planet. Mercury is closer to the sun but Venus can get more power than Mercury. Venus has has more power to gets the hotness. Venus is vantage point of Earth. 
1929	" As human studies, Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system. As humans study, Venus's atomospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our town. When Venus has low power of hotness, the weather on Earth has changed. The author said, ""A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus,"" (paragraph 3). "
1930	Today, solar systems are useful on Earth. 
1931	"Today, we're using computers, cell phone or tablat with solar. The author says, ""By comparison, systems that use mechanical parts can be made more resistant to pressure, heat, and other forces,"" (paragraph 7). Humans are still working on Venus to get more powers, even though we got lots of power from Venus already. "
1932	"Humans didn't want Venus's power at first because it's too hot and now, they want it because it's safe. In the paragraph 8, the last line, it said ""Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation"". "
1933	why should we stop driving cars? 
1934	However, some people think that this could be an actule human life form on Mars 
1935	and it very close to earth venus is the second planet from the sun its safe enough .  venus is 800 degrees fahrenheit its the hottest surface temputure of any planet in our solar system venus is largely coverd with oceans and rocky sediment it includes familiar . 
1936	Some say that aliens made it, but others said that it is a landform 
1937	Not everyone can agree that the face of Mars is just a landform or alien life; thus the face or landform still remained as an anonomys fact of mystery. 
1938	NASA is apart of the Government. The Government lies all the time. 
1939	"So that kinda makes people think that NASA is lying about the ""Face"" being a natural landmark. The Government and NASA are keeping secrets in Area 51. So they must be keeping this whole ""Face"" thing secret too. That it's not a butte or a mesa. But that it was created by life on Mars. "
1940	These face's seem as if they had alot of time to form. Can that mean there natural. 
1941	Think about this if these structure's were man made or alein made they wouldn't look like this 
1942	so what is that telling us. Another reason is if it was man made it would be much smaller. These faces have to be natural landforms. Also to my understanding NASA has been watching the faces for a while. 
1943	Then in picture three it is just totaly blown over. It seem's as if wind just keept blowing over then time and time agian. 
1944	If it was man made this would not have happend they would have kept it clean.  
1945	Some schools require students to complete projects to assure they continue learning during break. Should these projects be teacher-designed or student-designed? 
1946	This is stating that Venus could return or we can make it return to how it was originally and possibly live on it. This is a good reason I think Venus will be able to accept humans and find more facts and informations. 
1947	no matter how hard we try we will never change, this world is dieing and we are the once doing it. no the animals not the earth not the cars, us the human rase is killing the plant, we are the biggest pradusers of polution, we drive the cars we burn fosal fuals we are the ones killing our world. when th time comes the human rase is going to have to find a new place to livve beacase the world is going to be so toxsic that no living thing will be abal to survive on earth. the ones that will be blamd will be us and if we kill this planet it is oonly right that the human rase dies with it.  right now the world is changing there are people that think its no big deal and others that think its the end of the world. i realy dont know what to thinnk. its in human nature to be selfish and only worry about ourselfs so yaeh we dont evan care oubout ourself as a group or futer generations evan wild animals know the importants of pasing on futer genes. wild animals clearly under stand what we humans seem to always forget, we are all going to one day die. we wont be here forever and as a seseas we need to worry about our futere generations and were will thay live and how will they sevive.  we all love the time when we are teens and the big highlight of that time in our lives is that we start to drive. we are evan more exited if we get a new car, a teen going to the car dealership is like a kid at the candy store. differant colers differant sizes differant styales. they make it so everyone who is anyone has a new shiny car. so what do we do 
1948	we are kiling ourselfs and we are ignoring that fact if we dont change then we are all done for.  at the end of the day if we as a speesies dont change we are never going too help this world survive. we need to open ou eyes to what we are doing and not to sound like the preacher, see the arre of our ways. if we dont do that futer generations will never make it, us as a speaseas will not survive. we need to stop fooling around and get serious we arnt kids anymore. me us we you need to change but hey no one ever read this anyway.      
1949	I think it will be boring becuase you would be to that same place many times. Plus you would see nothing but water. Most likley the boat will smell like a barn full of anamils. Then you would also have to lift all that straw and bags of oat around the boat. You would have to clean up after them. I have 2 cats and I have to clean up after them and lift the bags of cat food. Boy let me you it is a hard job. But the worse part of taking care of my cats is when they get sick all over the floor.  So I dont really see why taking care of 100 some horses would be fun. unless you like horses. Then you would be working on the boat durring a war. that would be dangeras. Plus you would never be home to see your familay unless they came with you. But that probly wouldnt be allowed.  What if you get sea sick? Or a horse gets sick and spreds it around to the other horses? What if the boat springs a leak? A lot of lives will be at risk. Plus what if an animal that you are alergic to comes on the ship? What if the engine breaks and you cant move? Or you run out of food? What would you do? or if the lights quit working while your in the fog or its nigh, and your right in the middle of an ice berg feild? that would be a very rogh time. Or if some one needs medical attention what would you do? or if the caption got sickand it spreded around to the other crew members?  that would be a verytough time. Plus there would be noone to feed the horses becus evrey one would be to weak. 
1950	I sure wouldnt Want a job like that!!!!!!!!!        
1951	scientist should keep studing venus. 
1952	I am going to show you both sides why it would be good to go and why it wouldn't be good to go 
1953	Have you ever wanted to go to other planet to see what it is like? Why don't you go to venus. It is close to earth. 
1954	"In the text it says that ""NASA possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientist to float above the fray."" It also says that "" not a single spaceship has toched down on venus in more then three decases. No spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours and no one had ever been there."" You could be the first one to land on Venus. This proves that since it is a dangers planet it would still be worthy seeing it. Now, lets talk about why it wouldn't be worthy seeing it. "
1955	The student look at the mirror and try to smile so they can see the changing of the smile. Because when to stand in front of the mirror an smile that show every part of that smile so you can see that. However,, simile is come from our emotion if we feel happy or comfortable your smile will come very natural. If you not happy it will show you the smile lip without happy eyebrow . The student feel very excited about this part. The feeling of each of person are very important 
1956	Another thing, the FACS can remind the student to do their work first before playing on their laptop, just like what the mother would to their child. 
1957	that is why spacecraft now have not gone to venus in over more than three decades. In paragraph two in the last sentence, it shows how he talked about spacecrafts. 
1958	in paragraph five, frst two sentence it tell how nasa might have people go and discover more about venus.  My opinion on all of this that the author was talking about. It feels like a movie like,maybe in the future who knows when, we might have to go to venus because of something that happen in earth. we are going to leave homes and everything we worked on and live a new life in another planet. It kinda reminds me of that movie Â¨Wall-eÂ¨ they left earth nasty and a lot of poultion and went to live in a spacecraft in space. I would not want to live like that because what if somthing happened in the spacecraft 
1959	Back to what i was talking about, yea it would be cool to live in another planet, but those people that nasa is going to send out ton explore venus, have to explore it really carefully. I find it really interesting how there is a similar planet to earth. 
1960	"its also called the "" evening star"" is one of the brightest points of light in the noght sky, and its also the esecound planet from ourr sun, its simple to see from the distant but safe vantage point ofpoint of Earth, it has proved a very challnenging place to examine more closely. "
1961	And its also called the Earth's twin, becues the closest plant to shape like earth in tearms of density and size, and its the closeset plant to earth, somtimes its vence that closest to earth and somtimes its Mars, humans tried sending space crafts to land on venus, but none of them manged to servive the landing for more then few hours and that explains why no speaceship manged to go there yet for more then three decades. 
1962	and thats why human need to study it more more. 
1963	 and thats why we need too study venus more becues if anything happend to earth we might have a secound place to live in. 
1964	The advantages of limiting car usages 
1965	""" The reason that 44 nations joined the program was because, when World War II was over in Europe, and many countries were left in ruins, people around the world had got together from different nations to help these poor people, that got there town destroyed, house/apartments, and also helped the animals get taken care of. In the text it says, "" to help these countries recover their food supplies, animals, and more, 44 nations joined together to form UNRRA ( United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration)"" UNRRA hired Seagoing Cowboys"".  The Seagoing Cowboys are people to help take care of the horses, young cow, and mules that were shipped overseas. Luke had been traveling with food supplies for the aniamals and that people need. On Luke second trip he served as a night watchman, his job was to check the animals every hour. Being a sea going cowboy was much more than a adventure for Luke. It opened up the world for him. Luke was glad that he was able to help other people from other countries to help when World War II ended. He was also glad to help take care of these animals so they can still live. "
1966	The face that you think is there is just from the land was or an astroid 
1967	It it was made by aliens there wouldn't just one face on the planet. 
1968	The aliens didn't know what we look like or what a Egypion Pharaoh would look like. 
1969	Why would the aliens just make the face and not the body too. 
1970	The people who want the face to be made by aliens are not very smart. 
1971	If there are aliens and they find out who is watching and trying see if they are real, might come here to hurt or kill us. 
1972	"If we do find what do you think will happen, we ""hi we are from earth we are the ones who spy on you"".  First they proubly won't know what we are saying.  And they will most likely want to kill us.  "
1973	What we found was just a land marking that isn't something to we should mess with.  What you saw was just a land marking that means nothing. 
1974	There are no such things as aliens, and if there are such things as aliens we should just leave them alone. 
1975	This shows you that studying venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. 
1976	A boy named luke that graduated for high school and had worked two part time jobs in a grocery store . His friend had ask him if he wanted to go to Europe on a cattle boat ,luke said yes he said he couldnt have said no beacuse he doesnt like saying no to people. And he also said that it was a oportunity of a lifetime. It was 1945, world war ll was over in Europe, and many countries were left in runis . And too hope that those familys recover on food and animals. Then there were sign ups for a UNRRA Seagoing Cowboy and so Luke and Don sign up for it .In August 14,1945 ,'' Luke said , the day the Pacific war ended.'' they got their seaman's paper and boarded the SS Charles W. Wooster , headed for Greece- with a cargo of 335 ho rsees plus enough hay and oats feed them . L uke turned 18 before arriving in Greeece , which meant he he could be draft ed gfor military service.  When my draft board learned that i was on a cattle- boat trip , they h ad told me to just keep doing t hat for my service . 'by the time he was discharged in 1947 , Luke had mde trips - the mast of any saegoing cowboy. The cattle boat trip were an unbelivable oppportunity fo ra smalll towm boy,; he said , besides helping people , I had the side benefit of seein of seeeing Eurpe and China.  Then time past and Luke found time to hhave fun on board , especially on return trips after the animals had been unloaded . The cowboys played baseball and they aslo had played volleyball games in the empty holds where animals had been housed. Table-tennis tournament, facing , boxing, reading , whittling , and games als help pass the time . But being a Seagoing Cowboys was much more than an adventure for Luke Bomberger. it opened up the world to Luke e. '' i'm grateful for the opportunity'', he says . its made me more aware of people of other counties and their needs.'' And that aareness stays with him leading his familly to host a number of international students and exchange wisitersfor many years.  
1977	This article tells us the challenges that venus has to lay for us but this auther has found the was we try to beat tose challenges like in section 7 last sentenes he say that if we can just fine the resouses to build somthing to hold that force that venus has we could fined a lot that we dont even know. 
1978	Auther did a very great job finding his resouces and fact about his story he told 
1979	He's a hard worker because of this topic this isnt a everyday topic people talk about I love how he talks about the trips at the end of the passages that we might be able to go the venus and look at what its like on that planet 
1980	This article is good for people how like space and sciences to learn about venus and what we want to do as later missions it is possible that somthing once lived on venus thats probablly why we call it the twin to earth because it just like earth but just the first stages of earth. 
1981	Just if you ever think about wanting to go visit venus..make sure you bring lots of water and a cooling suit that'll cool you when you attempt to walk along across venus.       
1982	Advantage of limits on car usage and life goes on without car,car free cities in german suburb. these articles talks about how car is aint realy needed being use how now day peole and the article in german suburd,life goes on without cars discuss people given up on they car. there are only two places to park they have too it either you park at the edge of the development garage or buy a space for 40,000 along with home. As a result, 70 percent of vaubans families do not own cars 57 percent sold they cars just to move there. and source 2 paris bans driving due to smog. after all record pollution ,paris enforcced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city. monday a motorists with even-number license plates were ordered to leave their cars at the home or suffer a 22-euro. these same would apply to odd-numbered plats wellof course. doing the time of peroid 4,000 drivers were fined according to Reuters. source 3 car free day is spinning into a big hit in bogota .everyone in bogota took they day off car.    
1983	You also could probally visit the history building, were special events took place. People would even ask you to try or do something and that would also be a lifetime event that you always wanted to do. Most people don't like doing this stuff because it 'takes to long to get there' or something, but like i keep saying, it's a lifetime event that you would want to take because maybe you will never be able to do it again, but you can atleast tell people you have been there. While you are there enjoying them places, take pictures so you will always remember that moment, they say if you take a picture it will last longer. 
1984	Venus is like earths twin venus haves that same shape, and they even think that venus youse to look like earth. Venus just have diferint was of being its salf like the acid rain, hot temperatures, and even its crazy weathers. 
1985	I still think that trying to learn about differient plants is not right becuses us as people doint even know adout are oun plant. I still think that we have a lots of time till earth becomes like Veunus.  
1986	"Venus's is plant is formed just like earth But just with too much on it. strate from the"" Beyon high pressure and heat, Venusian geologgy and weather present additional impedimments like eruoting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning strikes to prodes seking to land on its surface."" Some scientist think that venus has youse to look eart and that it youse to support various forms of life,just like earth. From the text"" The planie has a surface of rocky sediment familiar such as valleys, mountains, and craters."" Thats how the scientist think that venus is just like earth. "
1987	If im still living when there finaly find a way to arive safly to venus I would love to go. NACA is working on a way to to git to venus and to land on that plant safly.     
1988	Driving without a car can be a quite tireing, 
1989	also less thinking into the drawings or other types of things that could involve using this technology. 
1990	"An example from the article is "" we humans perform this same impressive ""calculation"" every day. "
1991	Limiting this 
1992	in the backround I could hear the cows and people grabing on to them to save there lives 
1993	"""A man walked up to me and said you here to bring cows?"" My freind Don all ready got some cows of the ship, people started gathering around and they were exited because they had hope. "
1994	"""People, we are short of some cowboys for our program and we'd like some voluntiers, if anyone of you are grateful enough please join."" "
1995	"My friend Don came up to me and said."" It's okay we really don't need any more people, besides we'll have less food for us. "
1996	"It says that "" venus is sometimes right around the corner in space terms humans have sent numerous spacecraft to land on this cloud draped world. "
1997	I think the author supports the idea because, he talks about how he got so many reasons why the mission was successful or not, this also has a reputation.  This was very previous when i decided to support this idea. 
1998	Although, this author is very intelligent and experienced alot of things, i will support him in many reasons because The National Aeronautics and Space Adminstration has one part compelling idea for sending humans to study venus, he thinks its so good that now he telling people to check it out 
1999	If he had gave up on this support that he had, Venus would avoid the unfriendly ground conditions by staying uo and out of their way. 
2000	I support him because he makes it recognizable to see his point of view on this. 
2001	It must be scary to live up in Venus or mars. 
2002	Luke is brave to do this cause a lot of people just are scared to go across the world. 
2003	i explained why forcing students to join extra curricular activtys was a bad idea with three examples and with those three exaples i supported them with my opinon on why forcing them to join afterschool activitys was such a bad idea and how we should not do this with the opinons i had.   Â  Â  Â Â  
2004	Plus what would it hurt ? its not a painless unnoticable process that helps the students get a better education 
2005	That technology would not help in schools because the fact that students are sometimes not happy with how computer ads put up. 
2006	what is the point of the putting a computer that can read people emotions by scanning their face and the students are not going get any happier they are going be excited about at first and then get bored with it. 
2007	Computers are not good for kids at a young age they will get addicted to being on a computer won't go outside and then they are going to gain weight and then be fat. 
2008	Anouther thinn is that all the money that you spend to go on the trip goes to the people that need the money the most will reseve the money. 
2009	Luke's claim was a great claim! 
2010	because he or she is using context clues to tell what Venus is like 
2011	"Venus is called the ""twin"" planet to Earth because it is the closet planet to Earth in terms of density and size.(paragraph 2)Venus goes around the sun in different speeds compared to Earth and the other planets. On paragraph 3, the author tells us a little bit about what Venus is like for example the atmospher is almost 97% carbon dioxide. On the planet's surface, the tempature averages 800 degrees Fahrenheit and the atmospher pressure is 90 times greater than what we experiecne on Earth today. The author also tells us that ""Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system, even though Mercury is closer to our sun unlike Venus and earth and every other planet that revolves around the sun in our solar system.(paragraph 3) The author on paragraph 4 talks about what is living or on the planet Venus. For examplse, ""the planet has surface of rocky sediment and includes familar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters."" (paragraph 4) NASA has sent people into space and hase gone to Venus and to study the planet. "
2012	The author supports his story very well i think. He knows what he's talking about to be able to wright a story over it. 
2013	This planet is more so off by it's so that its not so close to I think it would be interesting to read more of his books to see if he's that intot it with those too or it's just that one book that they have! 
2014	"""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" is about how a computer can detect emotions from a picture or person. "
2015	In this passage, the author explains how this new software is able to detect emotions. 
2016	There are specific steps on how this software works. 
2017	The new technology is surprising. 
2018	"The text states, ""According to the Facial Feedback Theory of Emotion, moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions, but also may even help produce them."" New technology is able to detect human emotions, even when the person is hiding them. "" To an expert, faces do not lie; these muscle clues are sometimes used to spot when a ""smiling"" politician or celebrity is not being truthful."" The computer software can detect human emotions from paintings, picture, and in person.   "
2019	They can use their creative side of their brain and come up with a very educational but exciting project idea. They can ask they're friends and family to help. They can also use the internet if they don't find enough real life and personal resources. 
2020	There are good benefits and bad benefits of not having a car. 
2021	Have you ever had to do a summer project? 
2022	When the author talks about Venus he talks about how it is and what it is like and how it works. 
2023	Venus is different from Earth but it is the same in some way. It is differnt because of the tempurature and the atmosphere and the surface. The tempurature reaches up to 800 degrees fahrenheit and that is unsurvivable for humans. The surface is bad to it is a hot lava and molten like suface and it can melt most metals. Venuses atmosphere is mainly filled with 97 percent of carbon dioxide. The air pressure is really bad it is strong enough it could crush a submarine like its going down to the deepest part of our oceans. NASA is trying to come up with a way to study Venus with a blimp like vehicle that can float 30 miles up away from Venus and its nasty surface and atmosphere. Even though the tempurature will reach only 170 degrees fahrenhite it is still survivable for humans.       
2024	A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets venus, its even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric aciod in venus's atmosphere. it is usually 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and sometimes the atmosphere pressure is 90 times greater than what we experince on our own planet. All thought these conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on earth.  Also venus has the hottest surface temperture of any planet in our solar system. Even though mercury is closer to our sun. Venusian geology and weather present additional impediments like erupting volcannoes powerful earthquakes are frequent lightning strikes to probes seeking to land on its surface.  NASA is working on other approaches to studying venus. For an example some simplified electronics made of slilcon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of venus's surface and have lasted for three weeks in such conditions. These devices were first envisioned in 1800s and played an important role in the 1940s during world war II. Modern computers exidting in those days may sound schoking but these devices make calculations by using gears and levers and do not require electronics at all.  Striving to meet the challenge presented by venus has value not only because pf the insight to be gained on the planet itself but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors. 
2025	In conclusion venus has many dangers ways and it is very hot planet. its very hard to study  
2026	to have a topic to the subject 
2027	That with the author's idea of pursuiting to Venus. Even through with the dangers of it by studying to go there does'nt sound too bad to think of 
2028	That people are looking to traval to Mars well Earth,Venus and Mars are neighbor's there is a diffrentce Mars is not as hot as Venus, is closer to the sun.  
2029	Venus is some times closer to Earth the Mars is humans have send spacecafts to land on Venus but one thing about the dangers no human shoukd go it would be something to look in too. 
2030	Going to Venus would be hard knoing that no spacecarfts surviced the landing for more than a few hours. Venus is something that is not a good idea knowing that the average is over 800 degrees is nothing to play with just to go to Venus.  
2031	Another way to stay involved with your school is to work on the yearbook. 
2032	The counterclaim: Our travels on earth and beyond sold not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation. The evidence is in paragraph 6 many reasearchers are working on innovations that would allow our machines to last long enough to contribute meaningfully to or knowledge of venus. 
2033	One reason why it's dangerous is because no one have maded to venus. 
2034	A second reason why it's dangerous is that NASA is exprienceing new object to see if they could land in venus. 
2035	"For example in paragraph 5 in the second sentence it states ""NASA possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of venus."" A second example on why NASA is using objects is in paragraph five sentence four it states ""A vechicle hovering over venus would avoid to unfriendly ground conditions by staying up and out of their way"". "
2036	A third reason why it's dangerous is that humans are not believing and wanting to go to venus. 
2037	"For example in paragraph eight it states ""Striving to meet the challenge presented by venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but humans curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endevors"". "
2038	"""The challenge of exploring venus"" Is worthy pursuit despite of danger for these reasons, Alstranouts not landing, NASA making a new object to try to land, and humans not wanting to believe what's happeing and wanting to go to venus. I perdict that those were why the author suggest that studying venus could be dangerous. "
2039	On return trips after the animails have been unloaded you can paly games like Baseball and Volleyball games where the animails used to be hosted. Boxing, tabeltennis, fencing, whittiling, reading, and playing games also made it fun and let time pass quickley.  
2040	"""scientist seeking to conduct a through mission to understand Venus would need to get up close"" "
2041	If students were to do teacher-designed projects then they will be guided to do a better project overall and will learn stuff that can actually benifit them in the coming year 
2042	Plus the evidence has changed 
2043	Also we have pictures from 1976, 1998, and 2001 that shows its change and that it's a landform. 
2044	Also you might want to have the animal you were taking care of because you worked hard on taking care of it. Maybe when your children grow up they will want to be part of the Seagoing Cowboy program 
2045	Would having car free cities be easier for everyone, or would it make a huge impact on our society? It could go from commuting executuve or fewer soccer moms. 
2046	"Driveways, home garages, and street parking and forbidden in the experiment of the outskirts on the nee district. In a place called Vauban's streets are completly ""Car-free"". The only places that are not car free are downtown near the tram. You can only have two places to park and those two places are home, and large garages only at the edge of the developement it costs $40,000. Fifty-seven percent sold a car to move here, and seventy percent of families do not own a car. They say ""When I had a car i was always tense. Immuch happier this way"". Suburbs have linchpin called automobiles. Up to fifty percent in some car- intensive areas in the U.S.. and up to twelve percent of green house gas emissions in Europe. A home to 5,500 residents withing a rectangular square mile, it may be the most advanced experiment in a low-car suburban life. They say "" All of our development since World War II has been centered on the car, and that will have to change"". A fast-growing coalition of hundreds of groups in the U.S. are promoting new communities that are less dependent on cars. The EPA is promoting a ""car reduced"" communities, and legislatrors are acting cautiously.  Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city, after days of near-record pollution. Odd and even numbered plates were threatened to keep there cars home or forced to lay of fine of $31. Just about 4,000 drivers were fined. Sixety percent of congestion was down. China is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world. Taax policy favors Diesels over gasoline. Sixty-seven percent of diesels make up vehiclals, compared to 53.3 percent average of diesel engines in Wetern Europe. There is typically more smog in Paris. There were one hundred and forty seven micrograms of particulate matter per cubic meter, and this is compared to one hundred and fourteen and 79.7 reuters found. According the the BBC, public transit was free of charge from friday to monday. The smog had cleared enought monday for the ruling french party to rescind the ban for odd-numbered plates on Tuesday.  Millions of Colonbians hiked, skated, biked, or took busses to work during a car free day yesterday. Cars have been banned for 3 years now in colombia, there are only taxis, and busses left there a seven million people in that city. The goal was to promote alternitive transportation and reduce smog, violatoors faced a tenty five dollar fine. They said ""The rain hasnt stopped people from participating"". ""It;s a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution"". Cali and Valledupar, had joined the event. ""These people are generating a revolutionary change"". It has been seen to see one hundred and eighteen miles of bicycle paths. New restaurants and upscale shopping districts have ctopped up. Parks ans sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city. Rush hour restrictions have dramaticlly cut traffice. Uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks. "
2047	Aliens are real, Frank I'm telling you. The aliens made that face on Mars. Why do you think that, Grayson? No one can step on Mars. If a person steps on Mars, they will die. No one has ever been to Mars, Still to this day. Are you sure about what you are saying? I'm sure about this. Aliens live in the galaxy. They can step on any planet whenever they want to and not die. 
2048	Well I have something to say. Aliens do not exist. 
2049	If they were real, they would have took over the world. They would have been making us do work every single day. f they came here they would probaly have killed us by now. Have they killed us, have they started making us do work? No, they haven't. 
2050	Grayson? Yes, Sir? I heard you and Kevin talking about how aliens made that face on mars. Both of you are wrong. You were right about the no aliens part, but everything else was wrong. 
2051	"When we took the picture, I have got a lot of e-mails saying ""what is that thing?"" I even got a e-mail from Michael Bay saying that he is going to use that image for a movie. This stuff is crazy! "
2052	I hope we can find more stuff like that. Me too that was a wierd experience.      
2053	Ths technology is has helping the humans by their invention over the time. 
2054	The software that detect how people are feeling, while they are try to hide their emotions 
2055	It classifien on the basic emotion like happy, surprise, anger, scary, and sad. The computer it structure by a 3-D model of the face to detect their feeling. 
2056	"Of course, most of us would have troubles actually describing each facial triat conveys happy, worries, etc."". Just the computer can know the feeling you feel. if we face with an angry face but meanwhile it showing a happy face to us.""They even indicate the difference between a genuine smile and a forces one"". By identifity a real smile not a fake one its muscle it go the cheek. A fake smile the mouth its stretched sideway "
2057	Is describe how the computer can detect on a real face or just on a painted face descrbing of the facial movement were. The muscle of the facial is not expresses their emotion, and also can structure of their face with a smile. By feeling other their emotinos it can also us feel it,as just of creating an emotions. Describing a face is can't lie because of their different muscles, is just telling the truth of your self. It just to communicate between humans and computers with their feeling. 
2058	"They said one way we could get closer and see more is if we sdend a ""vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the roiling Venusian landscape"". "
2059	I thought that was a smart idea becaue if the ground is to hop to stand on and be on, having something hover over it is a grat Idea.  
2060	"They also said that Cenus is like our ""sister plant"". They say this becaus it has proven to be one of the ""most Earth-like planer in out solar system"" "
2061	"That is also a cool fact. I also read in the story that Venus is not the closest to the sun but yet it still is the hotest planet. In passage 4 it states,  ""The planet (venus) has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar future"". This is a intesting fact "

2064	"From Luke's experieance he know's that he is lucky to life in america. And that other people in other countires don't get a chance to live a good life. So Luke let people from other places stay at his home so they could go to a good school. And that awarness stayed with him for the rest of his days. Like he said it was an opportunity of a life time.  Luke had just graduated from high school and was working 2 part time jobs. One at the bank. One at the grocery. Untill one day his friend Don Reist came along and asked him to be a ""Seagoing Cowboy"" with him. He knew this was the oppertunity of a life time. So obivisly he went.  In August 1995, World War ll was over in Europe, many countries were gone. So luke and the other Seagoing Cowboys were sent there with food, animals, and more. Luke and his friend were shiped over seas to help as part of the UNRRA. He was shocked to see all the countries ruined. There was nothing left!  After all of that he was shiped to China with lots of suplies. One his way he got to see ols castles. He also traveled down the Panama Canal. The aniamls keep Luke very busy. They needed to be feed 3 times a day. They played lots of ball games to pass the time. Like volleyball and table tennis.  Being a  Seagoing Cowboy was much more than an adventure to Bomberger. On all over his nine missions he learned that he was very lucky. LIke he said,""It made me more aware of people of other countries and thier needs."" And the awareness stayed with him, he became a host for international students and exchage visitors for many years. That oppertunity chaged Luke Bomberger's live forever! We are very lucky to live in the USA becuase we have many more oppertunities the anyone else does.      "
2065	have you ever done at least one extracurricular activity at your school before ? i have never had a no expedients in doing aÂ extracurricular activity before 
2066	not always sitting and copping down notes but its not always boring doing those things but maybe having extracurricular activity at my school could be a good thing for all the students so they could have something to do instead of shitting down doing nothing and just being lazy. 
2067	it will teach you hoe to work as a team and not be alone it will teach you hoe to talk to one an other and also make you learn that you dont always have to do things alone also make new friends team work make people closer people they help each other when they need help on something and if you dont like to do team work things you should at least give it a chance because if you dont gibe things first chances how are you gonna know if you like it or not. 
2068	"When Mars' face started its fifteen minutes of fame it became a beloved ""pop icon."" It was featured in movies, books, and radio talk shows. It ""haunted grocery checkout lines"" for years. "
2069	"The ways emontions work is the way we are feeling at that exact moment. We may feel sad, depreesed, angry, happy, excited, or just fantastic. Emotions is how we express ourselves. Emotions can do with a lot of things love, care, affection ect. Emotions is just how people coupe with things like depression & things like that.  ""FACS"" Is ""Facial Action Coding System"" It can tell how people emotions are & how they are feeling at that moment. The system can just look at you & tell you how you are feeling but by percentages. It can 10% sad 85% depressed & 5% hungry thats how their scanners work  "
2070	That is why you sould be a seagoing cowboy.    
2071	"In the suburbs of Germany 70 percent of Vauban's families dont own cars, and 57 percent sold a car to move there. ""when i had a car i was always tense. Im much happier this way,"" said Heidrun Walter a resident in the suburb. "
2072	First of all i am against using this technology because, In the passage it says Faces dont lie and it can tell when someone is inmatating a fake smile and i dont really think that is true sometimes faces do lie. 
2073	I honestly think that being able to read student emotion is awsome in all but its kinda personal. i dont think people want other people know about their emotions. 
2074	In the passage it states that when a student becomes bored and confused Dr. huang predicts that it could modify the lesson like an effective human instructor. 
2075	The Law has been made in Georgia that requires hands free driving, that means people can drive and talk on the phone without touching the phone. The Law is still not as helpful as expected 
2076	In this situation, the law should be made very strictly that person can talk hands free for only few minutes and eliminates other conversations while driving, only important conversations should be allowed. This law can save so many pedestrians too, who runs into a car wreck daily. One example is of an old lady in Atlanta she was run over by a driver in the evening and he didn't even stop after words two weeks ago, according to the news. The lady ended up dying on the street right on the spot. 
2077	luke bomberger wants to be a seagoing cowboy who rides the waves becuase he is used to riding the waves because he crossed the atlantic ocean 16 times and the pacific twice to help people affected by WW 2. he rode on a cattle boat to europe to be a sesgoing cowboy. his friend don reist is going and he knows that luke can surf. and don invited him and luke is working to jobs as a bank accountant and a grouchery store. so he has to decide wether he should go or he should stay at his zenith.  luke decides to go and it was 1945 in WW2 was all over europe many countries were left in ruins.  to help these countries all 44 nations joined together to form UNRRA hired seagoing cowboys such as luke luke and don signed up.  in august 1945 the two boys luke and don recived threir orders the report to new orleans. the ywo boys are doing this so they coud be a sea going cowboy.  the two boys arived august 14. the day the pacific war ended they got their seamans papers and boarded the ss charles w. rooster and they headed for greece.  the cattle boat trips were an unbeleiveable opportunity for a small town boy luke also toured china greece venice and a excavated castle. luke was at the atlantic ocean for two weeks and it took him a month t get to china. 
2078	Limiting care usage is an advantage 
2079	I don't buy it. Rejecting car culture is certainly the dumbest alternative decisions that anyone has to make. 
2080	To provide reasonings to my strong point, brings me back to paragraph 36. It clearly states in bolded writing: ''With all these changes, people who stopped cars commuting as a result of the recession may find less reason to resume the habit....'' Furthermore, the demographic shifts in the driving population have strong trend that I can agree with. When you are fifteen, you can partake on the written and reading portion of driving and as you study your way to reach your goal, you get your permit. As you ascend your way into the online session and the real world test, you'll find yourself receiving a license as your ticket of permission to be behind the wheel by the law and by the state. Car ownership turnmoil is documented and caputred by the state due to it's nonfundamental implications that's truly not beneficial to those who rely on taking responsiblity for their actions. But if the decrease in measures that can be jotted down on paper proves that you have overestimated your duties and perogative that will not be catergorically denied before a state court or driving school. Once you lose your vehicle, it's not about banning the driving, this is about how to teach the driver on how can he or she be better the next time. Taking away driving privileges and sorts of public transportation will ease it's way to find itself in a world where nothing will be run by anyone.    Â     
2081	My opinion is that we should study venus. 
2082	Venus has something we want to learn about, not specifically that but about it. 
2083	Studying venus would be much better. 
2084	"We would know more about venus and it is. We would know what it has and what don't it have. ""Astronomers are fascinated by venus because it may well once have been the most earth like planet in our solar system."" Some of venus features are unknown but some are analogous to those on earth. ""NASA's possible solution to the hositle conditions on the surface of venus would allow scientists to float above the fray."" "
2085	"""Venus is one of the brightest points of light in the night sky."" Venus is the second planet from our sun. We are curious what venus has and study it. It has so many things that earth dosen't. It's a whole different planet. ""NASA is working on other approaches to studying venus."" "
2086	The challenge of exploring venus was being able to study it and what all was on it and what could live on it 
2087	I believe that the body of this should be faced not feared. 
2088	The evedence that supportes this artical is when its talking about how NASA is getting involved 
2089	"The author who is talking all about the planet Venus in this story, is explaining its history and some interesting facts also. Venus is usually called the ""Evening Star"" in paragraph one. "
2090	"Venus is often reffered to as Earth's ""twin"" on paragraph two. It is also the closest planet to the Earth where 7.6 billion people are today. Each planet orbits the sun in different speeds and when the Earth fully orbits the sun, it is a brand new year! Every time NASA tries to explore Venus with a space prob or something familiar, it would never end up touching the ground of the planet due to a mailfunction with the gravity most of the time. "
2091	The author explains that Venus is a popular plant and should be mostly known for being so close to the Earth. 
2092	Even though NASA has accomplished moon landings, might mean we could accomplish landings on Venus or another planet. 
2093	"In this new approach to limit car usuage stores are placed a walk away on a main street,rather than in malls along some distant highway. even in the united states the enviromental protection agency is promoting ""car reduced"" communities and legislators are starting to act, if cautiously.  for example congestion went down in france after five days not being to drive and of intensifiying smog.70 percent of vaubans families do not own cars,and 57 percentÂ  sold a car to move here. most people are happier with the the car usage limit due to that fact that they have too be tense anymore. and the wandering children drown out the occasional distant motor.  Vauban,home to 5,500 people wihtin a rectangular square mile , is the most advanced experiment in low-car sudan surburban. many experts expect public transport serving suburbs to play a much larger role in a six year federal transportation bill to be approved this year.  New suburbs may look more vauban-like,not only in developed countries but also in developing world,vauban,germany residents of this upscale community are suburban pioneers,going where few soccer moms or commuting excutives have ever gone before: they have given up their cars .  Vauban,completed in 2006,is anexample of a growing trend in europe,the united states and else where to seperate surburban life from auto use,as a component of a movement called ""smart planning"" "
2094	Others might say that think it's all fake 
2095	All in all my beliefs are still the exact same I'm sticking to what I think is right. Everyone has their own opinion but if it would get bad because people think all differently this is just what I have on mind. 
2096	The face in my eyes I believe was real because you can't just drop what you're doing and go take a picture of something that's totally fake. 
2097	Everyone has their own opinion though and that's how I see it. 
2098	"Regarding robots, I wonder if Baymax from Disney's ""Big Hero 6"" had something like it. "
2099	He was like a robotic nurse as explained by the main character. However, it wouldn't work in concrete tunnels. 
2100	"Regarding computers, if the feature could have come out a bit sooner, then Nickelodeon could've used it for a non-animated TV show they came out with, called ""I Am Frankie"". "
2101	I'm still waiting for the show to continue. In one of the last two episodes of this show, one of the judges for this competition that was like a quiz show said that computers can't feel human emotions, but a girl who was part computer proved her wrong. I like this show because it gives me proof of how smart computers are. 
2102	"I'm pretty sure the ""Transformers"" movies have something like it too. If the ""Transformers"" movies and ""Big Hero 6"" use it then it was probably already thought of. "
2103	when you look at the mona lisa it brings a smile to your face 
2104	It shows you how much a computer can do. The computer knows when you are sad and happy. It's like a dog knowing when you are upset or happy. 
2105	Not all students have or must participate to school activity, but is there choses rather they want to or not but i thing is impoent to partticipate an actiticy at school is for there good.Â  
2106	The author supports their idea very well. 
2107	Mona Lisa is 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted and 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry. Mona Lisa is a Painting that is drawn by the use of color painting and other handful material, when humans are drawing with their hand and feelings it shows the facial expression and emoyion of the drawing 
2108	"In technology, the human muscles, 3-D computer model of the face and all major humans muscles are installed in the computer, ""The process begins when the computer constructa 3-D computer model of the face; all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles. Movement of one or more muscles is called an action unit"". Technology should not be use to paint or even draw because technology cannot express human feelings and behavior. "
2109	Luke Bomberger became a Seagoing Cowboy he helps people whose lives had been affected by World War ll. 
2110	Luke crossed the Atlantic Ocean sixteen times and the Pacific Ocean twice, to help countries recover their food supplies, animals, and much more as it says in paragraph two. Even though it was a long journey across the oceans and the waters were rough 
2111	"he got to see many different places such as the Panama Canal on his way to China in paragraph five Luke says that ""seeing the Acropolis in Greece was special"" and ""so was taking a gondola ride in Venice , Italy a city with streets of water. Luke thought that it was all so great. "
2112	You might find an uncharted island and make a lot of money off of it. 
2113	the author is right in this passage because in paragraph 8 nassa is trying to shut down all the towers 
2114	the author about this story he wishes nassa could go away but that will be inpossonle 
2115	these differences from nassa are in speed mars and other times to venus because venus is sometimes around the corner cloud drapped world 
2116	each previous mission is unmanned and for a good reason cause nassa can handle there men unmanned they all survied the landing for more than a few hours. Maybe this issue explains why venus spaceship hasnt touched down in almost 3 decades 
2117	So nassa is concerned about venus spaceship 
2118	A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets venus. if our sister planet is so inhospitable why are scientists even discussing futher visits to its surface 
2119	there wasting there time for all the importanty of nassa. 
2120	the surfce was rockey and couldnt be walled on because of that reason or drove on there was mountains and craters furthermore. the nationL aeronautics and space administration (NASA) has one particularly compelling idea for sending humans to study venus. 
2121	This can be taught as if you we're being instructed by math. 
2122	But they might alsp, have other feelings within inside them. The new software stories similar anatomical information as an electic code. 
2123	when you try a dress on for example they'll say wow! that looks beautiful on you and then you'll have a much better self-esteem/ more confidence, also when you go to the mall and your looking for jeans for example and you say what about this one? one will say yeah it'll look great on you while others might say it looks fine but this one will look better on you and you'll have different peoples opinions 
2124	"You may belive that it was aliens that created this ""face"" on mars, Where is your proof to support that eveidence "
2125	Whats your proof that its aliens, Becasue when we have circled the rest of the planet we have not found civilizations or colonies of alien life. 
2126	For instensts a metior could have just hit the planet in that spot leaving a mark that looked like a human face leaving you to belive this. There could be aliens out there but there is no proof that we have them in our universe yet, There are many diffrent reasons why there could be natrual causes as to why it would look like there is a face on the planet. 
2127	We jsut have no evidence proveing wether or not this is an alien artifact or its just a natual landform.        
2128	Why would the author ignore the dangers of venus 
2129	Because of how hot it is it's very dangerous .  
2130	Why is venus called the evening star? Well it is as know as that because it is one of the brightest points of light. 
2131	Why are scientist wasting their time trying to explore it and how would we know what is actually in Venus if we haven't yet explored it. 
2132	I think it may be a bit to dangerous for any of us to actually be able to explore it without the right equipment and the right person to send there without knowing for sureif they would be getting hurt or not. I think it is to much of a risk to send someone up there and risk their lifes all just to be sure if Venus is safe or not.  
2133	"In paragraph 4 it states that ""Long ago,Venus was probably covered lagely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life,just like in Earth""scientist could just want us to have a better future for our future kids and families along the way. "
2134	In this pargraph it is saying that Venus could be another resource for us to use as an Evacuation if Earth is no longer safe for us we have a second choice.  
2135	In order to assure that students are learning over the summer, some schools require students to complete summer projects during their break. Some people believe that summer projects should be student-designed, while others believe that summer projects should be teacher-designed. 
2136	Venus is dangerous because its one of the closes starts to the sun. 
2137	But they said venus is like the earth twin. So do you think that it was once life on that plantet before in the past and the sun ruined it so there no more life everything is excint on that planet. 
2138	"Venus, sometimes called the ""Evening star"" it is one of the brightest points of light in the night sky that is amazing. Well Venus is actually a planet.  Venus is called the ""Evening star"" is one of the brightest points of light in the night sky. In our solar system Venus is the second planet from our sun. While Venus is simple from the distant but safe vantage point of earth it has proved a very challenging place to examine more closley. Often referred to as Earth""twin"" Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size and occcasionally the closest in distance too. Earth, Venus, and Marsour other planetary neighbor, orbit the sun at different speeds. These differences in speed mean that sometimes we are closer to Mars and other times in Venus. Maybe this is issue explains why not a single spaceship has touched down on Venus in more than threendecades. Numerous factors contribute to Vensu reputation as a challenging planet for humans to study, despite its proximity to us.  "
2139	You could learn so much about Venus its really cool 
2140	"In the excerpt ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" the author states ""each previous mission was unmanned, and for good reason, sice no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours"" (Challenge). Landing spacecrafts on the Venus is almost impossible. There is too many factors that NASA will not be able to figure out for the next fifty years. "

2144	The Mona Lisa is a subject painting by Leonardo Da Vinci who tried to show the perfect emotion of her, Mona Lisa's face 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful and 2 percent angry, How could we know that in a neutral face? Is not magic, is just technology. 
2145	"Now exist a new system that can recognize the emotions, thsi new innovation from Prof. Thomas Huang of the Beckham Institute with collaboration prof. Nicu Sebe of the University of Amsterdam, they are experts at developing better ways for Humans and computers to communicate, this actually is not like math homework when we can calculate.  The process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face. Then, Dr Huang relies on the work of psychologists, such as Dr Pail Eckman creator of FACS (Facial Action Coding System). This man classified six basic emotions HAPPINNES, SURPRISE, ANGER, DISGUST, FEAR and SADNESS, and he associated each characteristic movement of the facial muscles.  In fact,we humans perform this same impressive ""calculation"" every day, so, you can probablly tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face.  The Mona Lisa demostration is really extented to bring a smile to your face, while it shows just how much this computer can do, however the same technology can make computer-animated faces more expressive- for video games or video surgery. For now this is the answer for the questions of the beginnig, this is the new technology can do today, What will can do next? "
2146	"For me a car is very important , because if you have a car you can move to other places that you want . But not only that , if you have an emergency you can go rapidly,or in time . But this is not a facility in all countries and exist much problems with that , for example in Germany the street parking ,driveways and home garages , this are generally forbidden ,new district on the outskirts of Freiburg, near the French and Swiss. but in Vauban's streets are completly car free , this is so good , but with a limit ,likeÂ  except the main thoroughfare , where the tram to downtown Freiburg runs.  In conclucion:""As a result , 70 percent of Vauban's families do not own cars , and 57percent sold a car to move here"". And this is in source 1.  In source 2, in some countries exist prblems with traffic in the strees. One example is Paris ,"" 4,000 drivers were fined , according to Reuters ,27peoplehad their cars impounded for their reaction to the fine. But the traffic go down 60 percent in the capital of France , after 5 days of intensifying smog . But of courseÂ  some countries have more that others , for example Paris typically has more smog than others europrean capitals , ""Paris had 147 micrograms of particulate matter ,per cubir meter compared with 114 in Brussels and 79.7 in London , Reuters found .  In Bogota, Colombia one day is celebreted as Car free day , but in onceÂ  year occur somthing different , millions of colombians hiked , biked , skated or took buses to work during this day , leaving the streets without traffic jams .  Paks and sports center also have bloomed throughout the city , uneven pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad , smooth sidewalks ,Â  and others , restrictions have dramatically cut traffic . In conclucion the day without cars is part of an improvement campaign that began in Bogota in the mid 1990s . "
2147	they can meet new students 
2148	be active 
2149	learn more about a subject. 
2150	the autor suggestds that we should explore venus, personally i think it not a good idea but the author really does not support it and gives great examples to why we shouldt go out a study this beautifle planet called venus. 
2151	on paragraph 3 the author really gives us great exam-les of the problems of exploring this planet one great exaple that i think will convince people from not going is that the authomosphere of venus is really thick and it is 97 percent carbon dioxcide which is bad for us , and also the temprature on average is 800 degrees which is pretty hot. 
2152	As i saw read this part i noticed that the author isnt really against studiyng this planet he supports it. 
2153	taking some one 's cars away will hurt some people 's feeling and this idea sound good to me because some teenagers keep making some fast cars and racing in the streets and thereÂ  is some time most of them got their self killed or burning a life in the car if they can especially take those cars away it will be more safeand tey will stop dying in cars accident. 
2154	if we were to drive less 
2155	The face on Mars has become a popular icon. It has starred in Hollywood films, appeared in books, magazines and more 
2156	The idea of useing technology to read students emotions can have two different sides to it.  People can like or hate this subjuect 
2157	The new software can make 3-D models based off your face, to be able to do this software need to have fine accuracy. the software could identify humans emotions, but should be used in some cases. As in making computer-animated faces more expressive for video games or video surgery. 
2158	The new software is a compter that can know someones emotions just baseed off of one photo, or painting. This compter has such fine accuracy that it can make 3-D animated faces by the 44 major muscles thats in your face. This compter can know weather if your happy, surprised, anger, etc. This makes it easier for game designers to create people with better expressive faces, can help with video surgery. 
2159	"Often referred to as Earth's ""twin,"" Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size, occasionally the closest in distance too. Earth, Venus and Mars, our other planetary neighbor, orbit the sun at different speeds. "
2160	These diffrences in speed mean that sometimes we are closer to Mars and other times to Venus. The Harsh tempatures and low air pressure the raidation would not exceed Earth levels. Not easy conditions but survivable for humans.  
2161	NASA is working on other approches to studying Venus. For example, some simplifed electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface and have lasted weeks in such condtions.  
2162	Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere. On planet's surface tempatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet. These conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth; such an environment would crush even a submarine accustomed to diving to the deepest parts of our oceans and would liquefy many metals. 
2163	Venus has the hottest surface tempature of any planet in our solar system, though Mercury is closer to our sun. Beyond high pressure and heat, Venusian geology and weather present additional impediments like erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning strikes to probes seeking land on it's surface. If our sister planet is so inhospitable, why are scientists even discussing further visits to its surface? Astronmers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system. Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life. Today, Venus still has some features that are analogous to those on Earth. The planet has a surface of a rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains and craters. 
2164	You should not make it required to stay after school because we might have a job,parents that are divorced,wont have much time to chill, and our siblings might have to walk there house by them self.Â  
2165	There are many ways to limiting car usage 
2166	it would be much safer for your if it gona have a cerfiu. 
2167	i think if they were to put a cerfui on driving out at night time less bad stuff would happen let me explain my self. If i somthing were to happen to me like getting kid napedÂ  and i dont retuen home by 3;30 yor gona knoe somthing is wrong and maybe it might even save my life.  then our goverment could make money by giving us tickets but hopefully its not a lot because ufortuanetly not every one has a little cash in there pockets like some of us do.  If in case it past the curfui and u need to get home you could just walk home or have the cops take you home beause all cops are free taxis. If you didnt know. its aslo totaly free. cops arnt just here to give you tickets. 
2168	The face was used in grocery store checkout lines for 25 years! 
2169	the technology is getting so advanced that one day someone will make sonething that can read your mind or etc. This machine can only be valuable on some occasions like when someone says that they want you to know their emotions and how they are feeling then they will tell you theirelves you dont need a machine to do it. 
2170	Becuase then you will be all in their business and people dont like that 
2171	People can use this machine uncontrolbaly and it could get out of hand and share more things then it was suppose to and that could make people feel uncomfortable and not so happy 
2172	Also if other people found out your secrets and things they can get spreaded and start rumors and other things that can be bad for you.  
2173	they could make life long friends that have the same interest. 
2174	For an example, if you join a club or sport and know nothing about it, you could ask someone in that club or sport to explain and help you understand more about it. After that, you just might have a new friend.  
2175	Students who don't have any activities to do after-school should sign up for a sport or club because they could become really interested in it and keep doing that activity throughout the school year. Students should join extracurricular activities because they could be fun and it could be a new experience. 
2176	If you have a small friend group and want to expand, joining a club and/or sport would be a good option because there's always teamwork involved. Students could make friends just by having the same interest in a activity, subject, hobby, etc. 
2177	*they only do it like that at some schools* 
2178	Why students should participate in extracurricular activities. 
2179	Rules are a basic principle in the world.  If you follow the rules, you don't get in trouble.  In school, there are some classes that require students to learn over the summer break through an assignment.  The purpose of these summer assignments is to ensure that students are maintaining or learning knowledge that will be used in the class the following year. 
2180	Exploring Venus isn't a bad idea but very risky. 
2181	Considering Earth is the closet planet to Earth. NASA could potentially send robots in the spacecraft to see what information they can give. 
2182	"No ones life should have to be put on the line to explore a diffrent planet. I personally think its a great idea. As said in the passage ""Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation.""         "
2183	The Mona lisa demostration is relly intended to bring a simile to your face wihile .  People are trying to do new ssttuf with new tecnology but some of this peoiple dont know that some times they do need to have or use tecnology they want to just do things as there way but some times they do need to use tecnology and do what they have to do so they can fix the old stuff and new stuff the monalisa just a little simle but they can fixii it withtecnology and try to do some thinh new they have to look for more tecnology and expressions to be sure that they are doing whta they have to do in expression of the wghat they have and maind.  
2184	The doctor said that they dcan fix the or modify the expression or lesson from what they are talking about . 
2185	They are trying to said that they want to invent a computer that knows when are you happy and when you are sad or angry and other caind of emottions.  each they there are trying to have new tecnology and new stuff they have to see whats goin on in that they have to do what they have to do.  Other peopl;e dont like to see other people expressions because they get enoy from seeintg them.  They are seeing video games and trying to see what can they do to modofy them . 
2186	Seeing you in the miriror each they its like you are trying to see something diffirent that you can see becuse alreddy has the face that you have to see even tho they are not in the same expression ecah day becuse some times your actitud your face your simile arte the ones that can change with aout let you know each day you will hav a expressions that will change your face 
2187	 On my second trip I was the night watchman my job was to report to the captian every hour to tell him how the animals were doing one rainy night I was making my hourly report  I slid down a slippery ladder and craked one of my ribs 
2188	He siad that the prussure and the heat is even difficult for the bots that scincetist had made. 
2189	He also siad that NASA is compelling an idea that sends human to study Venus. 
2190	Some of the advantages to limiting car usage 
2191	For people to say that aliens are the ones causing it to look like a Face is also a arguement. 
2192	They did mark that it was theirs by making it a face. Then why does it look like a human face? It looks lik a human face because maybe thats how they saw the first human. 
2193	venus is a hard planet to study but it is very worth it. Becayse there are alot of things you can descover about venus and alot of people that would love to know whats really on venus.        
2194	Do you know what the challenge of Exploring Venus is? Well venus is the second planet from our sun. Venus distance but safe vantage point of Earth has very challenging place to examine more closely. They also often called Venus as the Earth's Twin. Let's see what The Challenge of Exploring Venus is all about. 
2195	First of all,  Earth, Venus , Mars are like neighbor that orbits the sun at different speeds. 
2196	Secondly, The thick atmosphere is almost 97% of carbon dioxide that blankets Venus. 
2197	Thirdly,  NASA has one particularly compelling ideas to send humans to study Venus. 
2198	In a conclusion, Do you know what the challenge of Exploring Venus is? Well, Earth, Venus , Mars are like neighbor that orbits the sun at different speeds. The thick atmosphere is almost 97% of carbon dioxide that blankets Venus. NASA has one particularly compelling ideas to send humans to study Venus. So however, I just exploring about Venus so I think I past the challenge.       
2199	Your principal has decided that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity . For example , students could participate in sports ,  work on the yearbook ,  or serve on the student council .  
2200	Doing sports or something you are interested in makes you feel good , and it makes other people look at you in a positive way . It's good to try new things and to explore, do things different sometimes . 
2201	"The doctors and prof. say that the process begins when the computer constructs a 3-d computer model of the face;all 44 major muscels in the model must move like human muscles. Movement of one or more muscles is called an ""action unit. Also Dr. huang observes that artists such as da vinci studied human anatomy to help them paint facial muscles precisely enough to convey specific emotions. His new computer software stores similar anatomical information as electronic code. "
2202	"Dr. Huang also stated that most human communication is nonverbal,including emotional communication. Dr. Huang also gave some examples of what movments to do in front of a mirror. For example raise your lips at the corners of your mouth. second squint your eyes slightly,to produce wrinkling (""crow's-feet"") at the corners of your eyes. Holding that, raise the outer parts of your cheeks up,toward your eyes.  "
2203	They even indicate the difference between a genuine smile and a forced one. In the real smile, the Zygomatic major (muscles that begin at your cheek bones) lift the corners of your mouth. Meanwhile,muscles called orbicularis oculi pars palpabraeus make crow's-feet around your eyes. But in a false smile, the mouth is stretched sideways using the Zygomatic major and a different muscle, the risorius. 
2204	Since the machine can calulate all the emotions it has a better chance if getting the right exact emotion the person is feeling and get all the emotions. This machine would be about to detect how any person is feeling and can show up at 6 emotions.  
2205	"""She's 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry. That was a discription of the Mona Lisa painting that the FACS gave. This shows how many differnt emotions she had and the machine was able to pick them all up.  "
2206	If your looking a Venus from a far because you can't go on it, and neither could the spaceships...you can't really get a good look at the ground or the planet itself. So there may be something else that's intresting about venus that we don't know yet. 
2207	Reading about venus I have learned a lot, 
2208	"like venus is one of the brightestv points in the sky and when it gets dark you coould see it. Something new as the article says they are trying to figure out whats strong enough to last in venus's conditions. Today they use powerful computers, as it says in the article ""Modern computers are enormously powerful, flexible and quick."" "
2209	Today they are learing new ways and soon you'll know more about Venus.   
2210	This new sytem is a great idea/invention. this needs to be known. mor people need to know about this amazing idea. 
2211	All of that doesnt sound right why not just express what you feel your emotions, Just be yourselfs 
2212	On the other hand another reason why people are scared to show their emotions and feelings is because the care about what other people think about them 
2213	That is one thing people should not care about do whatever makes you happy making good decisions. But happy is what everyone needs to be we only live once and why not spend it with the ones we love and that make us happy, 
2214	This essay is on if I think the use of technlogy to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable 
2215	I believe the use of tehcnology to read students expressions is valuable because as a studnt myslf i know how it feel to have to do a computer assignment and not get whats going on or its moving to fast so u get frustrated or angry 
2216	I feel sometimes thats all kids need is extra help because honestly im a student that needs extra help thats only a little bit of the reasons why i think that is valuable 
2217	Students facial expressions show everything you need to know you just have to get something to catch them . Of course they are going to have to make sure its spot on . What if i completely understanding everything and then they start to break it down then what ? Because tehcnology is not perfect .  
2218	Have you ever wondered what your life would be like if you did not have to drive as much. Maybe you didn't have a car at all. A small experimental suburb in Germany is tooling with the idea of a no car life style, along with many cities in the United States where a car is not a neccesity. Paris however has banned car usage all together, becuase of the amount of smog produced becuase of the automobiles. This could marke the end of car culture across many countries, exspecially the United States. 
2219	"In the first story it says "" there have been efforts in the past two decades to make cities denser, and better for walking ..."" it also says that "" passenger cars are respondible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe ... and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States."" David Goldberg said, an official of Transportation for America, a fast-growing coalition of hundreds of groups in the U.S....who are promoting new communities that are less dependent on cars, "" all of our development since World War II has been centered on the car, and that will have to change"".  "
2220	"In the story ""  Paris bans driving due to smog""  talks about how after days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city. It says that on Mondays motorists with even-numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22-euro fine ($31). The same would apply to odd-numbered plates the following day, I think that this should happen all around the world, so the world can be a better palce to live in. Here is a fact form the stroy, "" Paris typically has more smog then other European capitals . . . [Last] week Paris had a 147 micrograms of particulate matter (PM) per cubic meter compared with 114 in Brussels and 79.7 in London"" "
2221	"The 3rd stroy was about how in Bogota, Comlombia they do a car-free day, now that should be done here in the U.S.. It says that millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work during car-free day, that the streets of the captial city eerily devoid of traffic jams, and that the rain has not stopped people from participating.  The last stroy talks about how the car culture is coming to an end, but i really hope not and i think not. It is here ,in the U.S., the birthpalce of the Model T, a classic car that i love and i would hope so that a lot of more people do too; the home of Detroit, what i know is that they make cars up there; tha place where Wilson Pickett immortalized ""Mustang Sally"", I do not know what that is but it does sound important. It also says that "" driving by young people decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009..."" I mean the highest it went was 2009, we are in 2014, almost 2015, im a young person and i love to drive i think and feel like i can go as fast as light. "
2222	But what about walking on the surface to explore from the space craft? If we could walk on the planet without being harmed by all of the outside forces, then we coulf run more tests. 
2223	Like I said in the intro, If we had the materials to keep a human safe to walk on the planet and take samples. 
2224	We would have plenty of things to test here on Earth. Venus also has the hottest surface temperature in the solar system. If we could find a way to keep the hot air out and the cool air in, we could do it. 
2225	It's illegal to drive with a phone and its multiple why you can't drive without a phone 
2226	Stores are becoming closer to walking distance 
2227	its faster to walk if they bring the stores closer to you. 
2228	The FACS can know if your sad. 
2229	I need to say it is very cool. 
2230	I really think this is a good idea, we can know if the presidents or old history people were happy or sad.             
2231	Luke was at his part time job when his friend Don came in and said (do you want to come on a cattle boat trip with me.) Luke knew it was a opportunity of a life time and couldn't say no. Luke was 18 before he arived in Greece which meant he could be drafted for military service.  When the draft board learned he was on a cattle baot trip they said that he was able to keep going on the cattle boat trip. The cattle boat trip was an unbeleivable opportunity for a small towns boy like hime.  Luke helped out on his aunt Katie's farm whch prepared him for hard work but not for the dangers at sea. Luke also found a way to have fun on board even on return trips after the animals had been unloaded.  When Luke got home he was very grateful that he was able to go on the trip. To the cowboys it was an adventure but to Luke it was a opportunity to open up a whole new world. And that awareness stayed with him, leading his family to host of intternational students and exchange visitors for many years. 
2232	Dr. Huang has came up with a computer that can read human emotion's.  Now Dr. Huang's computer syestem can tell six human emotion's and let me tell u somthing human's only have six emotion's those emotions are (happiness, surprised, angery, disgusted, fear, and sadness). 
2233	the computer can recognize the subtle facial movments we human's have to express hoe we feel. 
2234	Computers use this thing called CALCUATE EMOTION'S it those are your thinking part of your emotions like as simpole as solving a math problem and doing your work or thinking ahead. 
2235	"This article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile."" shows many examples or evidence that support my claim like; "" The facial expressions for each emotion are universal,"" observes Dr. Huang, ""even though individuals often show varying degrees of expression"" (like not smiling as broadly). Using video imagery, the new emotion-recognition software tracks these facial movements--in a real face or in the paited face of the Mona Lisa. "
2236	Making suburbs much more compact then they are right now will lead to less car usage. 
2237	Do you like extracurricular activity? If you dont know what that is some examples are sports,newspaper,and student council. 
2238	How will extracurricular activities make students more social? 
2239	For instance,you could find that playing football is your thing. With all the different activities there is no way you will not find the thing you like. 
2240	HopefullyÂ I convinced you to be on my side. However, if your still not convinced that is fine. In conclusion,extracurricular activity help students be social and find what they enjoy. 
2241	I am not against it because it is cool and something different. Also the fact knowing a computer can read your emotions is kinda cool. 
2242	I think that they should not change their current screen to a different screen 
2243	I say it should not because maybe that person is bored or confused. But you never know if that person is doing something they have to be looking at or working on. For example say i am playing a game. But i have to do a review over the game fro a project. That probably would make me frustrated because the computer think im bored or confused and have an ad appear. 
2244	Of course the idea has pros but not that main one of them is that it will look good in college applications, but not as good as doing something outside of school without the principle telling you that you HAVE to take at leastÂ one extra curricular activity v. I WANT to take an extra curricular activity! 
2245	moral of the stoy we need to get out there and discover new things.  
2246	If his friend had not been there to tell him about it he would have been working two jobs his whole life. Luke is probably very greatful.  Luke is also the best there because he has went threw the route nine time as you see on paragraph 6. Luke point of veiw would probably tell more about what he saw during the trip and what he did. He loves 
2247	Luke is very talented for having this job because you have to feed the animals about three times aday and keep them alive. You can state this information on paraghraph 6 and 7. He worked so much he got hurt and craked his ribs. He was happy to be alive. Therefore he had to stay at home to get better. 
2248	Its also so cool how they played sports when they had free time to take the time away. Its amazing how he can get all those animals and pick them up on the boat and take them across the country and drop them off. He was realy good at his job to do that! That is how Luke Bomberger made history in America. 
2249	The idea of a machine that can read emotions is cool. Though can be a little scary that commputer can tell if your happy or sad. But the idea is still cool to think about. I would like to see if they can even get the FACS to work on animals in the furture. 
2250	Some family members may want to know that but will never know if they don't have the FACS. The FACS seem to be good on paintings so I was thinking that it may work on a dead body. Becaues if it works on Mona Lisa, then it should work on anything that dont use muscle ever or in the past like a dead body. 
2251	My therd reasion is if you make it be useable on animals then we can uncover a lot of mysteryes 
2252	Like if you wanted to know how your dog or cat felt about you all you had to do was turn on the FACS and see. We could also see if lions kill becaues there mean or becaues they dont know what eals to do. Many things could be uncover thnks to FACS. 
2253	The Venus is second planet from our sun. The Venus is the hottest surface remperature of any planet in our solar system, even though Mercury is closer to our sun. It is 800 degrees Fahrenheit.  Venus is the closest planet to earth densigy. People sent numerous spacecraft to land on his cloud draped world. No spacecraft survived that land for more than a few hours.  A long time ago Venus is cover with largely oceans and various froms of life just like Earth. Venus still has some feature that are analogous to those on Eart. The planet has a surface or rocky asediment and includes familar feature such as valleys, mountains, and craters. At thirty-plus miles about the surface, temperature would still be toasty at around 170 degree Fahrenheit, but the air pressure would be close to that of sea level on Earth. 
2254	NASA is working on other approaches to studying venus. 
2255	For example, like electronic made of silicon and it been tested in chamber simulation the chaos of Venus surface and have lasted for three weaks in such conditions. They have another project to look back an old technology call mechanical computers. This devices make calculation by using gears and levers and do not require electronics at all. Modern computers are enormously powerful, flexible, and quick but tend to be more delicate when it come to exterme physical conditions. By comaprison, systems that use mecanical parts can be made more resistant to pressure, heat, and other forces.   
2256	Everyone should get the chance to stay after school just once, and if they don't like it they don't have to continue staying in an after school program. 
2257	Being known as Earth's twin, Venus is a planet most people are famliar with. Having rocky surfaces, sediments and mountains, this planet was most likely very close to earth long ago. The author states that the surface temperature reaches 800 degrees, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than Earth 
2258	Then the idea is brought up, what if we lived on Venus? Exploration of this planet has begun, and with profound dangers, scientists are still pursuing the idea. Venus is a planet that has tough conditions, but still may be suitibale for life. 
2259	Studying venus is a amazing purduit because no human could not live in venus or go up to venus because its far away from earth and we haven't made a spaceship that could reach all the way up in venus because it could never make it 
2260	Another stuff you can be finding for venus is the clouds that are highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus. And on the planet;s surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure in 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet.  These facts that you can research are very true because you could go up there and find out all theses stuff and these facts support my claim because you can research cool stuff about Venus and that other people didn't know about and thats how it supports my claim. 
2261	Some schools partake in making their students create summer projects to influence them to learn over break, and to ensure that any and all learning from the previous year wasn't completely lost. 
2262	In addition, if teachers continue to design the majority of the students summer time projects, consequently, the project assigned will be either completed to its minimum rather to its maximum, and not to mention the overall quality would definitelyÂ be dramatically decreased 
2263	regardless of what the scenario is, if the reins were loosened a bit to let the student design the summer time project, chances are it may make the student happier, and eager to do more summer time projects before the next school year begins. 
2264	I will be talking to you about how scientist's are thinking of putting things on the planet Venus and i wll also talk to you the fasinated thing our planet Venus has to offer. 
2265	"Well Venus is sometimes called a Evening Star. It's so bright that young stargazer would be able to find it. Venus is very hard to get a good look at, it's the second planet from the sun. It's name can be misleading, and the planet is refrred to earth as our "" twin"" plaents. We haven't been able to send a spacecraft over there yet because of the fact that the stuff we send over there are not able to survive for less than an hour. Scientist's have onle been able to send robots and teven they can't find a safe landing sight.  The clouds on Venus very corrosive since they have sulfruic acid in them. The air is also 97 percent carbon dioxide. The planet also has the hostest surface, it's tempurature can reach 800 degrees Fahrenheit. The atmospheric preasure is also 90 times greater than Earth's, but despite the planets dangers it would be a worthy pursuite. For example the planets atmospheric preasure is so strong that it crush a submarine that can go into the deepest part of the ocean.  Scientist's are fascinated by the planets Earth-like apperence. They think that long ago there use be a form of life that could have been very much Earth-like. The main reasonfor why astronomer's are so fascinated by Venus is because it looks very much like Earth. For example it has valleies, river bank's, and even mountains. Scientist's are thinking of sending a blimp like aircraft that can fly or hover at least 30 if not higher miles the planet's surface. The tempurature would range around 170 degrees Fahrenheit. The best part would be that there is plenty is solar power.  "
2266	Overall with the facts about the planets and information that was brought up by the different ideas of the scientist that were listed in an organized fashion, I think this was a great essay. 
2267	Cars have been around for many years and generations. People rely on cars for transportation 
2268	if the NASA cameras did not see any people/aliens. On that fact if NASA did see any aliens on Mars they would have kept it top secret and wold have not showed the images to the world 
2269	Not saying its true but if NASA had shown an alien on Mars the world would freak out and we wold destroy each other.  Now tell me if you seen an alien on Mars what would you do? 
2270	All I am saying is in 1976 if aliens did make that face then why are we still here? Why haven't the aliens came yet ? 
2271	Because if aliens were to make that face on Mars then that means they seen NASA's cameras circling their planet so they would've found a way to get them down. But I think it's a big pain in the butt to the people that think thier is alien life on a planet in our Solier System 
2272	I also want to no part in this discussing because if you don't want to belive me that is on you to look crazy if front of the world so do what you think is best about it I have to get to back to work. 
2273	You could have so much fun being apart of this journey.  I think being apart of this program would be a awesome opportunity because not alot of people could do this and be apart of a program. You also get to see really cool things like antique artifacts,really old buildings,and diffrent lifestyles. This would be so much fun because you can learn how other people live their lifes in different countries,and explore places you never thought you would even go to. You could also see different cultures and try their kind of food they eat every day,and see how people in different countries go about their everyday lifes. 
2274	Luke' point of view of convincing others to participate in seagoings cowboys program . 
2275	The text states , Luke was 18 before going to grece and when the draft board learned he was on a cattle boat trip , they told him to just keep doing his service . The text also states , it took about two weeks to cross the Atlantic ocean from the eastern coast of china to the united states and a month to get to china . The text also states , caring for the animals during the crossing kept Luke busy , they had to feed and watered water the animals two or three times a day . Luke says helping on with his aunt katie's farm as a boy had prepaired him for hard work ,but not for the dangers at sea . on his second trip , Luke served as night watchman . his job was to check on all the animals every hour . Luke said on one rainy night , after making his hourly eport to the captain , he slid down a slippery ladder on his backside , and his heart started pounding . Luke also found a way to have fun on board, especially on return when the animals have been unloaded . At the end Luke said being a seagoing cowboy was much more than an adventure , it made Luke's world open up for him . This proves that Luke's point of view convincing people to go to the seagoing cowboys program . 
2276	having a car not only affects your daily life but allso affects your environment. 
2277	I think the photo is just a plain platform they has been formed into something it was not. 
2278	I think the author supports the idea well 
2279	because i would think it would be dangerous going to see venus , but that is just on what i read in this passasge. 
2280	Venus is the second planet from the sun which means it is very hot. Venus is 800 degrees fahrenheit and is 90 times hotter than what we experience of earth. Humans have sent many spacecrafts to Venus, but none have sucessfully made it, the ones that have landed didnt make it longer than a few hours. A spacecraft hasnt touched Venus in more than 3 decades. Venus has an atmoshere of 97 percent carbon dioxcide.  Scientists want to explore venus because since it is the closest planet it earth maybe at one time it had life. Venus likely had a great amountof ocean water and could of had many lifeforms. Venus would be our closest option if we visited a planet. Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray. A blimp like vehicle hoverig 30 or so miles above the roiling Venusian landscape would be a good option. 
2281	In all four sources they have advantages of limiting car usage. 
2282	these examples from these four sources inform citizens about the advantages of limiting car usage. And there are some really good examples that inform you about limiting car usage. 
2283	That time is given as a break from school since throughout all the other months, they are required to learn what they are being taught. If the project they are required to complete is student designed it wont seem like as much of a threat to them and wont be looked down upon as much. 
2284	No one should force you too do anything that is outside of your comfort zone except your parents, they can force you to do anything they need you too do. Other than your parents and family members,no one should even think about forcing you to do something because that is just a horrible thing to do. unless they have permission from your parents, I don't think that they should be able to tell you that you can or can't do extracurricular activities because that would'nt be fair to the people who actually enjoy them. As for the rest of us, we'll be fine her as long as we don't have to do any pointless extracurricular activities. So to answer the question, would you like to have to do an extracurricular, No! not at all, but some people might 
2285	Scientists shouldn't travel to Venus anytime soon. Why would you say that you may ask there are a few reasons why scientist shouldn't travel to Venus. Venus isn't a safe place to travel to 
2286	It's already a risk traveling in space, but it's an even bigger risk to travel to Venus. Here are some of the reasons why Venus isn't safe. 
2287	First the unimaginable heat on Venus can make metal boil in a snap 
2288	Next the atmosphere is mostly made of carbon. 
2289	Finally just like Earth Venus has natural disasters as well. 
2290	So many people claim alot of things. people will claim that the moonlanding was fake. Wadonna wears a wig eveyrtime time you see her. elvis presely isn't dead. hitler many still be alive today. but we dont know any of these things, you see the idea that we claim things is sometimes true and can be sometimes unrealistic. 
2291	"technoloy floods our brain, meaning there is so many inventions it just brainwashes us. We can use photo I.D. now for getting on to our phone. There are mixed emotions when we do show our personality, the techonolgy recognizes it. So we can change everything so someone says, ""the facial expressions for each emotion are universal,"" observes Dr. Huang. The mona lisa drawing is suppose to bring a smile to everyones face.  So people are still wandering what the mona lisa represents, the mona lisa represents art and beauty. There is a song called mona lisa, and its kinda a love song, saying your my mona lisa baby. So i think the whole idea of this song is to show that the mona lisa is a thing of beauty it represnts more than just beauty.  What else does it represent, well does your expression in the mirror suggest an emotion? Do you feel mad or sad. if you felt sad and you were crying and you went to the mirror and looked in the mirror, what would you see in yourself because down deep inside if thing yuo incredibly hurt. Can your lab partner recgonize which emotion you are doing? yes there is a doctor for that. there are so many emotions you dint even know throughout the day. "
2292	in conclusion the many way we show emotions can be mixed up. 
2293	The impolsovity or maybe catatonia, these emotions are so rare they are usually not effected by people. So lets talk about the signs, alot of people would have droopy eyes mening lieing. Donald Trump and many politians lie to get what they want.    
2294	But using the Facial Action Coding System (or FACS) on classroom full with students could be a good/bad idea 
2295	Conspiracy theorists often try to confuse the public by saying that NASA is trying to hide Mars. 
2296	Overall, texting and driving is as worse or maybe even worse than drinking and driving due to everyone having a cell phone and not everyone is at the legal age to drink alcohol. Texting and driving can happen in any part of the day while drinking and driving is usually around night time due to how everyone drinks when it get dark outside. 
2297	I beleive it could also maybe work for sports but other than that i dont agree that we should have thoese emotion reader system in our classrooms. people might not want to get recognized as mad,sad,happy or even just plain or tired.  
2298	Another last reason why i dont beiieve it should be in the classrooms because just as i said in the other paragraph that peoplemight notlike it or might now want people to know how they feel becuase it might be personal. 
2299	It is personal and its crossing the line. Soem people might get into a fit and that wont look pretty.  
2300	If students are already stressed out with outside activitys then why should they be forced to do another things on top of what they already have? A lot of students get stressed out over school related things and if the school makes them do more things outside of school it'll just make them more stressed. 
2301	Lastly, a lot of students dont just spend their time doing nothing all night 
2302	want to welcome many people to study the world to see whats its like to know when something is gonna happen or how its gonna happen. 
2303	Sometimes studying things can be real helpful because you can learn so many things about it. The article states, Â¨These differences in the speed mean that sometimes we are closer to Mars and other times we are closer to  Venus.Â¨ 
2304	This indicate that anything could happen if we touch one of those planets. He addresses the speed in the planets when it orbits the sun. Anything can go wrong if its always going like that. Its like having something spinning around everyday. Eventually, something is gonna go wrong and its gonna mess everything up. On the other hand, People who study space would know the answer to what will happen if they was to touch. The author basically wants others to care about the world. He wants others to see both parts of the world. It doesnt matter if something is bad you should still have respect and love in it because its here for a reason 
2305	He stated Â¨ Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation. This means that if we are traveling and something goes wrong we shouldnt have to stop traveling because of the dangers. We should be able to still travel to avoid giving people so much worries. Traveling should be expanded to reach like different destinations so people can see whats its like to care for the world and whats its like to not csre care for the world. 
2306	Venus's thick atmosphere is made up of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide, which blankets the whole planet. The average temperature is about 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater that what we experience. Scientists should know that if they try and send a spacecraft full of men to Venus and land they are risking lives. 
2307	It would be a huge victory for use if something like this happened. 
2308	It can calculate how you feel just by constructing your face and seeing how all 44 mucles of your face are. 
2309	These new technology is so amazing because it can even be on your own PC. 
2310	China or the Pacific Ocean. You can get a chance to go to Greece and see wat it is like out there and get a chance to get out of the USA. 
2311	You should join the Seagoing Cowboys program and help the poor and homeless people get in the UNRRA so they will not be hungry and live a better life. You casn help all the people. in Europe and give them food and stuff so they do not starve to death and try to get them a home and thery will not be left out and hungry. 
2312	Some people love animals so they can help out with the horese and other animals. You will have the Nightwatch and go and see iuf all the cows and horses are on the ship. But when it is raining and nyou on nightwatchb you will have to be careful because you can slip and break your bone or crack them and even worse you caN slip off the deck and be in the ocean or where you go but if you slip off there are some strong currents that can pull you down and you can drown or they can pull you away from the ship and take you to a island         
2313	The way  Dr. Huang designed the program can only read certain emotons . It reads the most comman ones we all have 
2314	What the author is trying to prove with this is the danger despite it presents by being really close to earth. Something else that is really important for us to know is the speed and space. Yea it might not be as important but the author wrote it because he thought it was something important to know . What he means with speed and space is that, With speed it means that sometime Venus is closer to Earth but also sometimes Mars is closer and this because the rate of speed going through. In space is the numerous spacecraft to land on this cloud-draped world because of humans. 
2315	Then it would show u how to take care of someone how been picking on or let say that you just did not have a good day. Then it put on viens or thing that make u laught into u cry or it put on some cat that are funny. 
2316	I think it is a good thing then all you will have to do is say to your computers how do i feel today it will say to you 
2317	like It say in fact, we humans perform this same impressive calculation every day. For instance, you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by look on her face. Of course, most of us would have trouble actually describing each facial is feeling simply by the look on her face. 
2318	The FACS can tell your emotions by the way the muscles in the face move making it easier for the computer to identify what emotion the human is felling. They use video imagery to create a new emotion- recognition software tracks these facial movemets. Also the new technology can identify mixed emotions.  The article also describes how by making a expression can make you feel slighty the expresion that was just used. According to Facial Feedback Theory of Emotion, moving facial muscles not only expresses emotions, but also may even help produce them. This may happen because weunconsciously imitate another person's facial expressions.  
2319	because the school would be crowded 
2320	homework time wouldÂ be decreased for students 
2321	Luke Bomberger had a friend who asked him to tour Europe with him, he knew he couldn't turn it down.  World War II had just been in Europe, but was now over. Many comturies were left in ruins. These contries needed animals and livestock to survive. The UNRRA hired seagoing cowboys to take care of the livestock on the boats when they were being shipped to a certain part of the world to another. Luke and his friend wanted to care and help, so they signed up for seagoing cowboys program.  Luke had turned 18 upon the first trip, which meant he could be drafted for the army. His draft amnagement company had learned he was in the seagoing cowboys, and they told him to keep doing what he was doing, because it was a form of help.  Sometimesthe weather was bad upon the boats, and sometimes it was good. When it was bad, members upon the boat would participate in watching the storms. One night Luke had watch, he got into a bad accident that left him without work for a couple days due to broken ribs. When the weather was good, and all the chores were done for the day, the men upon the ship had time to play games or travel to see things. The animals are what kept Luke busy though.  When Luke had quit the seagoing cowboys, he had successfully completed nine trips, the most trips a seagoing cowboy has ever done, delivering animals to people in need of them. 
2322	Every person has a different excuse or reason why they are texting and driving but in overall there are some that are the most common of them all. 
2323	"even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's athmosphere."" Why i think this is a detail that supports the claim is becouse in paragraph 3  "
2324	I thinck for the emotional things of the technology is kind of more advanced like every moment they do something different 
2325	they always have to make a digital and some other people don't really get about the digital things they get lose really easlly and for some other people is more likely an easy thing to do but not always because it has their difficulties and they are challenging so they have to do it right or they will mess up the photo 
2326	and theirs a conclusion about this and is kind of creepy that now computer can easlly detect the movement of our facil 
2327	guess what they mean like emotions and other things that's on our faces but i think it helps people to understand how things work and how our selfs are doing if their mad, sad, happy etc. there is better ways for humans and computers to communicate not only by facial recognizing, all the software of all the people are different and computers softwarre is just way different then humans it just takes time to figure this out quickly. 
2328	things can actually change from good to sometimes bad and it's not the way to show their expresion that has been having by the other kind of people. 
2329	I was able to learn a lot of body language from the animals. I now know when an animal is nervous or angry. I can tell when a horse is calm and happy. Knowing animal body language may help you not get a broken bone from being kicked by an angry horse or cow. You will also learn how to take care of the animals. I already knew how to take care of some of the animals from working on my aunt's farm, but I learned how to care for animals a lot faster from doing it hundreds of times everyday. 
2330	"And my final piece of evidance stating it is worthy of studying Venus is in Paragragh's six and eight ""peering at Venus from a ship orbiting or hovering safely far above the planet can provide only limited insight on ground conditions "
2331	"because most forms of light cannot penetrate the dense atmosphere, rendering standard forms of photography and videography ineffective. Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors. Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation."" "
2332	It turns out that cellphone-use-while-driving laws vary depending on the state that you're in. If you're on a road trip across state lines, troopers might be able to pull you over for something that may be perfectly legal in your home state. 
2333	Today we will talking about The challenge of Exploring Venus, what's is venus, where is ubicate venus and why is important talk or learn about this subject or who discovered this mean. 
2334	Venus is a planet in our solar system and is the second planet from our sun and occasionally the closest in distance too Earth, Venus, and Mars , in this palnet the scientist can't explore this planet because is so far away from the Heart , and this have some differences, for example; one of these is the speed mean that sometimes we are closer too mars and other times to Venus.  Venus maybe this issue explains why or not a single spaceship has touched down on Venus in more than three decades, scientist said that the atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus, also this planet has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system, Venusian geology and weather present additional impediments like erupting volcanoes, powerul earthquakes, and frequent lightning strikes to probes seeking to land on its surface.  We know that Venus is a planet in our solar system but that we really don't know and scientist wants to know is know about if in that planet probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, human wants to conquer some of those planets to live in the future, that's the reason why the scientist are discussing about that, or if the rich peolpe can build some skyscraper or some building for rich people go to travel in Venus.  NASA is working to know more about Venus, another example is if the electricity can works there, or how we can get it,  Venus from a ship orbiting or hovering safely far above the planet can provide only limited insight on ground conditions because most forms of light cannot penetrate the dense atmosphere, more importantly, researchers cannot take samples of rock, gas, or anything else, from a distance. Therefore, scientist seeking to conduct a thorough mission to understand Venus would need to get up close and personal despite the risks.  Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has values, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors. 
2335	We talked about Venus, we know now that human wants no only have more information they want explore and live there, also they want or we wants to know wha't there or if there exist life, but we don't know if Venus got inhabitants is not our planet and we need to leave it, but if we are capable to conquer, our next planet to live in the future would be Mars or also Venus. 
2336	When you're a teenager you want to be free as possible but sometimes you are too free, that you don't know what to do with this much freedom so you do nothing. 
2337	Human expression is how your show your emotions to your friends, family, teachers. 
2338	People express their emotions in many ways. Here is an example, Mona Lisa she was 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6% fearful, and 2% angry most of the time. that's how she expressed her emotions.  
2339	Dr. Huang did research on peoples emotions and how people showed their emtions in ways, that he did know how people expressed their emtions with how their face looked to see their emotions show. Dr. Huang looked at the painting of Mona Lisa that Da Vinci painted to show Mona Lisa's emotion in the painting to show, how she felt about being in the painting to express how Da Vinci and Mona Lisa both felt the paintg that both of them liked the painting. Da Vinci emotion to paint a picture of Mona Lisa he felt happy, but he also that she was happy about him painting a picture of her being happy, mad. 
2340	i think what the author is trying to say from this is that he supports the study of Venus because his or her point of view is that it very simialr to earth and it way of being. 
2341	Is it a natural formed face or is it made by aliens? 
2342	There are no such thing as an alien. This was the reason why there no such things as aliens. We will be doing even more research, thank you.         
2343	I agree that students should participate with this decision 
2344	it can be good for them, 
2345	Make them get more involved 
2346	It can be good for them because they might enjoy it 
2347	They would be more excited.  It will make them want to do more work.  Also it will show how much you care about extracurricular activities then before. 
2348	Good options and it would change how you think.  Also its wonderful to see everybody getting involved.  Its good to participate in extracurricular actives because it can change their attitude for the better 
2349	So I think everyone would like to participate, and even if they don't want to they might enjoy it as well as the next person.  
2350	The author is worthy os studying venus because venus is a planet were there could mostlikly have human on the planet 
2351	To inform fellow citizens about advantages of limiting car usage you would have to tell them everything 
2352	Although one could argue that student-designed summer assignment have their own benefits 
2353	"Venuse is known as the ""Evening Stars because it is just a dot in the lends. "
2354	NASA is tring to find out more information about Venuse 
2355	NASA thinks aliens made the face because it looks like a face. 
2356	This shows that the face was out in the public for people to see.  
2357	"Today I was having an agument with my buddy. This argument was about ""The Face on Mars"". We both had our own opinions on what we thought it was. We weere sitting in my living room on the tan couch with the television on. My friend was tall with blonde hair and skinny. I had brown hair and was average height. "
2358	Zeke thought it was an artifact on once living life on Mars. He thought Nasa was going to say it was something else so people wouldn't truly know what it was. He thought Nasa was trying to keep it in the dark so noone would try and travel there to get closer looks on it and steal there idea. Zeke thought we needed to run further studies to truely figure out what this was. 
2359	Zeke, who was a man of what he said, did not believe me and wouldn't take my word for it. 
2360	Once he got an idea in his head it wasn't going to move for anything. It did not matter what proof you showed him he wouldn't believe as single word. He argued with me about if or hours until finally we decided that we wouldn't argue about it anymore. He still told me he thought his idea was right and I was completly wrong. 
2361	I told Zeke i worked for Nasa so I would know way more than he does an I insured him it was not an alien artifact and it was just a mesa which looked to be something it wasn't and that he shouldn't be so stubborn about it and just believe me. 
2362	Knowing Zeke I didn't thnk he would even budge. Of course i was right and Zeke didn't sway his answer at all. 
2363	I offered to show him prove. I had pictures of the event and so I showed him. He finally could see what we saw. He decided that he needed to look closer into the pictures. 
2364	"He gave me back the pictures and he said ""You know I think those pictures didn't help change my mind at all""   "
2365	"In the passage ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" by Nick D'Alto. "
2366	The software can help get rid of unwanted ads that annoy you and bring up the ones you like by something so simple. 
2367	producing many other benefits. 
2368	CA: Aliens could have made the Face as a siblimal message. 
2369	The Face is in the north part of Mars and that is a lava dome that takes form of an isolated mesa. 
2370	Venus a friend to earth and the closest to earth than any other planet. The density ,size are mostly the same, Venus,Mars is earth neightbor, orbit the sun at different,hottest planet. 
2371	Venus was to the closest to the size and distance of the earth. It was often called earths twin. Venus was also called the Evening Star,but that nickname was very misleading since it was actually a planet. Venus is also one of the most easiest planet to spot if you are standing on earth. Although venus was the closest to the planet The author also started to notice that Mars was close to earth also. Then he started noticing that sometimes Venus was closer to Mars and sometimes Mars was closer to Earth then Venus. 
2372	We already have amazing technology that we use on a day to day basis. 
2373	I'm not saying that this type of technology is bad 
2374	though it isn't good either. 
2375	I feel like this type of technology has no purpose what so ever.  
2376	So having this machine woud not be good to have because some teacher could be nosy and ask why are you mad or sad 
2377	The police could use this machine to find out if criminals are lying about what they did. Parents would also be mad that teachers are using the machine on their children 
2378	They do not need to know how your feeling at all. The teacher only us it for a reason or when nessasary not when they just feel like it. 
2379	 People should be able to use their phones while their driving, but at the same time they should not be able to use their phone at all. 
2380	"""What are some advantages of limiting car usage? "
2381	relaxing 
2382	but there would be much difficulty without the utilization of cars during this modern era. 
2383	The author does a good job of these statements because they give some examples to both sides as to why or why not there should be a study on life on Venus. The author seem to have thrown in a few claims to create an arguement for both sides if its a good idea or not. 
2384	"The author supports bhis claim once again in the first paragraph he says ""she's 83 percent happy,9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry."" The technology the author has been talking about this whole time just put Leonardo da Vinci's painting Mona LIsa face into one and zeros. "
2385	Another reson is in the text it states on april 8 2001 a cloudless summer day in cydonia mars global surveyor frew close enough for a second look. 
2386	Another exaple of why i belive its just a natural landform is in the text it stats thate they had to roll the spacecraft 25 degrees to center the face in the field of view. 
2387	they should respect that because we have lives to 
2388	I think that fellow citizens should have the advantages to car usage, because not everyone would feel comfortable ridding around in a bus or a train with lots of other people 
2389	The last passage explanes what I've been saying less people are buying cars why invent new things . People are going unemployedment an things aren't going to get any better for our country . The governments are asking for to much plus you have taxes an the IRS right behind them waiting to grab your money that you worked hard for . Another thing that I don't get is why the President of the untied states can help other countries but yet can't even of seem to help his own country who is lossing more money as days go by . Whats going on up their in the white house we the people slecet you the president to run our country not others an help benfit us. 
2390	Plus it is cool because you can find out alot of things about old pictuers, Like if you want to find out or just see how somebody is feeling you can use that. 
2391	because I mean who really cares what other people are feeling, unless you're close to them. 
2392	It's also just plain dumb like instead of focusing on this technology, that reads peoples emotions work on something more important 
2393	Mona Lisa Smiles Again  Frown and smile, love and hate, but can you see a face  How was Mona Lisa redone 
2394	The simeple ancer is computers. Also, there is sicince to derturmin how female faces have change over the years. There is also talking to pefrenciles to recrate it. 
2395	What determind this simple materpice.  This was not exantly come word for work but the wrighting shows it need to be based off older pictures. There is ovisely is estmation in the pargrafe. Unfortionly but not uncommon there was some gussing.  Why was the picture recoreted.  The lovely picture of Mona Liisa was to make it look better. The suftware was crated for 6 different emmotions, happiness, surpise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. Disiner of the sofware used was Dr. Paul Eckman. The reson why the sofware was indrectly used for this project.  How was Mona Lisa redone  The simeple ancer is computers. Also, there is sicince to derturmin how female faces have change over the years. There is also talking to pefrenciles to recrate it.  A face is not just a picture if is a way of life. 
2396	It was first discovered by a ship called viking 1 who was taking pictures of mars to see where it's sister ship viking 2 could land and it captured The Huge Face but due to low resolution they could not make it all the way out and they believed that it was a sculpture of a egyptian pharo.  
2397	It really isn't a face on Mars it's either a natural information or a alien artifacted. 
2398	"In paragraph one the author give us some little facts about Venus such has how we can see Venus from Earth itself and another name for Venus that many people may have never heard of""Evening Star"". "
2399	I know we have it we just done want to release it into the world which makes sense but at the same time we could have billions of people living on 2 differnt planets. Our technology is not quite there yet though, but we're getting somewhere. 
2400	"There is a saying ""The needs of the many out weigh the needs of the few"" and in the situation of our planet being compremised in one way or another that is very true "
2401	Teachers would have to think if this is really worth having, or is it going to do nothing for them. 
2402	I think if we can study Venus up close we'll get a better understanding of the planet, like what materials it has and how the weather conditions are. 
2403	NASA has a compelling idea for sending humans to study Venus. NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray. A blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the rolling Venusian landscape. However, peering at Venus from a ship orbiting or hovering safely far above the planet can provide only limited insight on ground.  To meet the challenge presented by Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors. Our travels should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation. 
2404	There is an argument going around on whether summer projects should be designed by students or teachers. 
2405	Technology can make people mad in happy its just how you use it in how you do it like you can look up things that you know that will make you happy. But in this story its saying that the computers know when you happy or sad or even confused but then it can help the person because it say it can modify. Its a lot that the technology it can't look you in the face in see that something is wrong with you. The story is saying they want to know how people are feeling even when they are trying to hide it i think that is personal and the person will tell you if the person wanted you to know. 
2406	But technology is good in so many ways but its bad in so many ways to. I think your emotions shoud stay to you if thats what you want and not base on if the technology want to know. 
2407	If the principle were to make this rule then everyone wouldnt be as lazy. 
2408	But if that sport is boring or not fun to me then i will and talk to someone about it. But what time will this activity be going on after school, before school, during school. no one know what time this activity will be going on. This is something that we need to know so we can tell are parents or gardens. 
2409	The author seems to be with the idea of exploring Venus. 
2410	the author also included that. 
2411	"Venus is like earths twin. The author stated in where the plant is loctaed. Venus tempature on the surface is 800 degrees. NASA is wanting to send people to the planet venus.  NASA is wroking on other approachaes to studying Venus. They smiplified electronics that are made up of silicon. They are trying to make the modern day computers even faster then they are today. NASA trying to create a machine that well last long enough to contribute to Venus. Their wanting to make gear that also dont need electronce inquired.  People call Venus ""The Evening Star"" becuase it is one of the brightest spot in the night sky. Although people mistaken it for a star its a planet. Venus is safer to see from the distance its been very challageing to exmane Venus. This planet is the secound planet away from our sun. Venus is the closest size to earth.  The NASA is very facinated by Venus because is the most earth like planet. Venus surface is very rocky like valleys and mountains. NASA is request to send some people to go check out the planet Venus but that is nearly impossable . They think that at one point Venus was just coverd inh ocean. Venus is the nearst option to vist. "
2412	how know what could be on the planet. If we do we should be real cafeul because there could be dangerous stuff there. Its an opertunaity to see what Venus good values are. We can also compare earth o venus. 
2413	The reason why I believe this is an alien because the face is an absolute landform of an alien. These photos were taken 1976, 1998 and 2001. In 2001 the face evolted more like a face of what humans it was of humans but I've been doing research that these faces are from aliens. 
2414	Although it does look like a human face theres no body connected to it unless the body is stuck underneath the surface of the planet, but through my research I insist it's an alien. I do not have proof it is one but theres no proof of it being a human either. When the Mars Orbiter Camera went around Mars the face still had no evidence if it was either a human face or an alien artifact.  
2415	", and you can tell by thier face exprestion or by the actions they do through out the day..In paragraph three it's showing us by saying ""  raise your eyebrows when you're suprise ; your orbicularis oris (around your mouth)tighten your lips to show anger"" every person that i know off knows that . "
2416	Why tell us information that we already know ? 
2417	Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break . Should these summer projects be teacher designed or student designed ? 
2418	Although the Face looks like a face, it may have not been built by aliens. 
2419	people say that venus is the twin to the earth 
2420	venus is the only plante that scintest studyed to see if humans can live in 
2421	"it they tried everything to studie it if humans ca n breath in it but they only found the resultes when they stoped working on it because they couldnt understand it so they had to change the way they were going to send humans to venus so they just quit but they started studying some more stuuf coming up with names for it and stuff in the text it says ""venus, sometimes called the ""evening star""( pargarh1). this shows that that they came up with names for so people under stand what the star is. "
2422	the artecal shows you how people can make nothing into something even if they fail they still can gt something else right or make something even though they tried to do something else.    
2423	So that is the reaons I think we should not have the facial action coding systems. 
2424	The last reason is how can we make it better. 
2425	The software can tell witch muscle is being used. That is how it know if its a fake smile or are a reall smile. 
2426	This will tech the students a face muscle. It will help tham later on how to tell a reall smile or a fake smile. 
2427	I am against that the technology doesn't have the support to make her smile 
2428	"because, it says ""His new computer software stores similar anatomical information as electronic code"" in the text. "
2429	I claim that the technology doesn't do anything with the Mona Lisa because, she is smiling in the painting 
2430	"because, it says "" A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becomine confused or bores"" in the text. While looking in a mirror, you see your own reflection of yourself because, it says ""Raise your lips at the corners of your mouth bacause, technology can't do that. Then squint your eyes slightly, to produce wrinkling (""crow's-feet"") at the corners of your eyes. Holding that, raise the outer parts of your cheeks up, toward your eyes"" in the text. "
2431	I conclude that the technology can't support the smiles of people's faces because, there are muscles, tissues, and cartlige in the humans head. They even indicate the difference between a genuine smile and a forced one. In the real smile, the zygomatic major (muscles that begin at your cheek bones) lift the corner of your mouth. (That's our instruction #1).  Them Mona Lisa is 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry. 
2432	We should explore venus 
2433	And that is all the ressons why we should not stop exploring venus. 
2434	Limiting car use is not a new idea. 
2435	"When Nasa discovered this ""face"", at first they didn't know what to say. So they just passed it as another ""Martian Mesa"". ""Scientist figured it was just another Martian Mesa, common enough around Cydonia, only this one had unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh. Eighteen years later after the Viking space trip, they decided to take more photos of it. The technology improved so it was giving them a clearer image. They got the pictures, and soon put them out for the public to see. ""The authors reasoned it would be a good way to engage the public and attract attention to Mars"". Thousands of people that were waiting for this image soon saw it was just a landform, ""JPL website, revealing...a natural landform, There was no alien monument after all"". Then later they figured out that the picture was acually a butte or mesa. ""What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa, landforms common around the American West"". Garvin says, ""It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho, thats a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars"". "
2436	The technology in 2018 is getting bigger and smarter. The technology is taking over jobs and everything. 
2437	The facil action coding can be use for some important hings like like they can use it in the police office or somewhere that they really need it. 
2438	The students can choose to use it or not they wont do it if they dont want to thats like making u do it. Some students will be surpice and some afraid of what might happen to them if something goes wrong. The technology makes alot of great things to hellp us who needs it. Teachnology can end up with the world if bad people do bad things to technology. I just want to be safe and have technology that helps me do good in my life. I maybe use the facial action coding to see how my emotions are but not use it for fun every minute 
2439	I think that the Facial Action Coding should only be use when that person wants to try it and is not scare of what would happen if sometimes goes wrong while checking her or his emotions. Techology sometimes is bad and good but more times is for the good ways to us. 
2440	I dont think its nobody part in life to know the next person emotions. only if your a conesilor you should know someone emotion or how they feel other than that NO this is a horible idea. iN Paragraph 5 it tells us it help them paint facial muscles precisely enough to convey specific emotions. The computer will even know all your muscles in your body to help them fing how your feelings this is real not cause for at all some people want to keep there life personal a possible. 
2441	because if they can do it they shouldnt make other people wanna do it,but i would also work on the yearbooks beacuse you are the one who is doing it all so you do it the way u want to 
2442	I see that all cars are is a deadly machine that can kill anyone at anytime. over a hundred inasent people die every mouth by a car accident or and motorised viache colision.  Theres some places around the world where cars are limited to residents owning a car. For example: Vauban, Germany. Just because theres to many people that do not own any type of transportation have to walk the streets and so the people that own cars have a hard time trying to get places with all the people crowding the streets. when theres to mant people walking it beggins to back up traffice to a point people give up there cars to actual get to their work on time or to see a movie before it starts 
2443	I belive cars should be limited to the point where people have to walk. 
2444	It sometimes can be use for just certain things and if that person gives you permission to look at the Site, then yeah it can be used to determine how they are feeling. 
2445	Some people may think this new technology may be an awesome technology 
2446	but like i said it should be banned because there is no point on having that techology if that person tells you how they are felling. 
2447	the author of the story says that venus is very worthy pursuit 
2448	because it is the closets to earth. 
2449	The author also says venus is our planetary neigbor. 
2450	Humans have already tried landing diffrent types of of space crafts to venus. those space crafts have all failed or have not survived more then a couple of hours on the surface. 
2451	It would be very hard to survive in venus 
2452	but venus could have all been eath like at one point. 
2453	Venus could have been covored in oceans and supported many forms of life. scientist want to make blimp like cars so the humans that are sent to venus wouldnt have to touch the ground of all those gases. 
2454	We can earn money and get a new house. You are shipping things. Things like milk dairy and other things. You could get a new house or a new car it might be able to be big small or whatever size you want it to be. 
2455	I would not want to live there for two weeks it would be smelly nasty gross and disgusting.  
2456	also I would be very homesick i would miss my family my friends and pets. Also what happens if you crash you you float out to see or get rescued or drown or live on to tell the tale? What would happen to the animals? would THEY drown or THEY float away or They survive or you could get eaten by sharks!  Or get impaled by a storms debrie or get very very SICK! or even worse someone kills you. Now I wouldnt want to be on THAT boat. 
2457	For my second to final papagraph I would 1 Not want to get sick. 2 I would not wanna get killed. 3 I would not want to get impaled by debrie. 5 I would not want to get eaten alive. 6 I would not want to see sick or dead poeple on my trip 7 I would not want to crash and get stranded 8 I would not like o drown 9 I would miss my family friends and pets. 10 I would not like to eat rotten or smelly food or drinks. 
2458	What would happen if you have to eat the animals then no more food for the poeple who need it and it would be cruel and you cant drink plain ocean water it needs to be distilled and run out of water faster. And if you fall over board you could get left behind or get saved and live to tell the tale or get thrown overboard or get eaten by animals or if the animals die then they get thrown over board and it would be wierd and gross seing animals being pulled along by the current. 
2459	Mars has aliens! 
2460	I believe there is life on mars. 
2461	I believe there is life on mars because of the photos because of the talk around town. 
2462	On May 24,2001 NASA sent Viking 1 in to outer space but what it found were still trying to figure out could there be life on Mars. The Viking sent back pictures of mars carved into it was a illusion of eyes nose and mouth so let me say again can there be life not just on earth but on Mars the question is still to be answerd. NASA says the have witness alot of things up that we dont know or could even imagin there could be life on every plant and if there is I know we all want to witness it one day. I know I am not the only one who would want to explore through out the box through out the earth but may I say the question is still out there for me for you for the future. So let that be known that you and me and what ever is out there are alike curious to seek and craving for advanture. You and me both will fly out of here hand by hand sister to brother to find whats on mars in the future qustion that is waiting to be answerd will be seen head smelled by the ones who are seeking that adventure to answer that qustion that we all what to know. Is there life on mars.   
2463	This passage is about a germany mom from the suburban pioneers where the commuting executives have gone before they given up their cars street parking , driveways also home garages are generally forbidden in this experimental new district on the outskirts for freiburg near the french and swiss borders vaubans streets are completely car free the main thoroughfare where the tram to downtown freiburg runs the few streets on one edge of the community ownership is allowed there are only two places to a larger park with alot of money you can buy a space with 40,000, with a home on the side. Vauban completed in 2006 is an example of a growing trend in rurope the united states and elsewhere to separte suburban life from auto use as a compnent of a movement called planning smart all of our development since world war ii has been centered on the car and that will have to change the guy david said of the transportation for america a fast growing coalition of hundreds of groups coaliton of hundreds of groups in the united states who are promoting new communities that are less dependent on cars thye said about the hybrid and things like that. In the united states the environmental protection agency is promoting car reduced communities and legislators are starting to act if cautiously many experts public transport serving suburbs to play a much larger role in a new six year federal transportation bill to be approved this year mr goldberg said previous bills 80 percent of appropriations have 20 percetnt to other transport. Diesel fuel was blamed since france has tax policy that favors diesel over gasoline make up to 67 percent of vehicles in france compared to a 53.3 percent average of diesel engines in the rest of western furope accordingÂ  to reuters 
2464	"When I became a Seagoing Cowboy, ""It was 1945, World War ll was over in Europe, and many countries were left in ruins. To help these countries recover their food supplies, animals, and more, 44 nations joined together to form UNRRA. UNRRA hired ""Seagoing Cowboys"" to take care of the horses, young cows, and mules that were shipped overseas."" "
2465	Well, I hope that I convinced you into becoming a Seagoing Cowboy like me. It's everybody's world. Let's help save the people in it. 
2466	The facial action coding system could tell a person if they are tired because the computer can tell by their muscles. It will tell the teacher wich student is tired so they teacher can do something about it. It will help out a lot of the teachers from telling who's falling asleep. 
2467	such as the Acropolis in Greece and the Panama Canal on my way to China. 
2468	Dr. Huang predicts that it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor. 
2469	I t says that the same technology can make computer animated faces more exoressive. 
2470	First of all, to prove this is a landform and not aliens is, there is only a face, no body 
2471	but that doesn't mean that also doesn't mean that it might do a lot of things right either. 
2472	Are principle has decided to make all students participate in at least one extracurricular activity 
2473	I think if you are failing a class you should focus on that grade and bringing it up and getting it to at least a C or B . I also think that kids that get in trouble shouldnt be allowed to because they didnt listen or did something they wasnt suppose to . Why give a kid this if they dont listen, they dont deserve to do something like this is they are being disrespectful or not listening. Students that do get good grades above a  D ad F and arent disrespectful should be able to do this if they wanted to. 
2474	I think the reason why they have advantages of limiting car usage cause all these changes 
2475	differnt thing are converging which are suggest that we are witessing a long-term cultural shirt. 
2476	another reason is that if that pattern persists they believe it will have a benfiicial implications for cabon emissions 
2477	aslo the environment and they aslo they sayed it might have a negative implicatins for the car industry. and because the cash-srapped americans could not afford new cars and the unempolyed weren't going to work either and young people decreased by 23 percent between 2001 and 2009. 
2478	they had demographic shifts in the drving poulation suggest that the trrends may have accelerate it 
2479	"When,  NASA unveiled the image for all to see, the caption noted a ""huge rock formation, which resembles a human head, formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose and mouth."" The authors reasoned it would be a good way to engage the public and attract attention to Mars.  Though, When Mars Global Surveryor flew over the Cydonia for the first time, Michael and his Mars Obiter Camera (MOC) team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting, revealing a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all  For example: As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size."" ""So, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see where they were."" The picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa- landforms common around the American West. "
2480	Would you join a seagoing cowboys program? 
2481	You can also visit unique things while traveling, and find unique stuff during this program. This proves that you should join this program. 
2482	You can experience adventures by going over the oceas. You can slso experience adventures by taking care of the animals. This is another reason why you should join Seagoing Cowboys program. 
2483	So you work to experience unique places and things. Also experience adventures and all you have to do is work a little bit. This is the final reason why you should join the Seagoing Cowboys program.  
2484	Do you belive in aliens? 
2485	Another reason why the alien story is real is because ,no one officially approved it. 
2486	I think the technologhy to read students emotional spreeions is a great idea 
2487	because it can tell you if you sad happy angery disgusted or fear. 
2488	Making a happy face was a great idea because its bring people happyniess to you becacuse its does not making you angery or sad. that why it was a grat idea about this painting.       
2489	Some challenges the author says that venus is thowing at us 
2490	how we can solve the high pressure and high temperature. The first way we can solve these conditions are if we started having people go and live on venus and took some other living organisms with them. The second way we could solve it is if we found away to connect venus to earth and that would take away all ot the problems. 
2491	people around the world that need supplies, and livestock. The Seagoing Coyboys program is a program for helping other's.  The first reason is the program helps with people in need. Luke and Don go help people and sign up for program. Example-  Luke helped Katie's farm for checking the animals every night. Then he slipped and cracked his ribs so he coudn't work for a couple days. He also took care of cattle while on board. 
2492	He went to many parts of Europe. In Greece he got drafted with the military. He went to China to help animals with crossings. In the Pacific and atlantic ocean he took care of animals, while going to Europe. There were alot things to do.  
2493	In the first paragraph he worked a two- part job. Then when going to Europe he gave cattle to people or farmers. He probably gave them food and water. The reason is because is the end of WWII and buildings are down. 
2494	Then they show us how we can do it at home and how we can make use smile or happy. 
2495	the face has also been seen as a pop icon, it has starred in a Hollywood film, appeared in books, magazines, and radio talk shows. Defenders of the national budget wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars. Maybe there is life maybe there's not who knows for sure. 
2496	In my opinon I believe the Face is real. Others might argue that its still something crated by aliens. Especially sense it was clearified as a butte or mesa. No matter what its an opinon based topic that you can argue about all day. The real question is what do you think?  In conclusion there has been plenty of research and examinations on the Face of Mars. I still think that the Face is real, others might think differently. This topic can go both ways in opinon wise. Think wise about this topic. Consider talking about it with coleagues and come up with a conclusion for this topic. 
2497	I think its true because some computers now have facial scan recognition but they cost a arm and a leg to buy but i dont think its worth it to buy a computer that cost a arm and a leg because if something goes wrong with the computer their will be no refunds but their should be refunds because they could probably sell u a broken or damaged computer. 
2498	Next: do think it would be a good idea to make a computer thats u can only access with your face because now a days people tend to steal stuff that doesnt belong to them like for example i had a friend who tried to steal my headphones one day but i had officer force her to give them back but when she gave them back the were broke.  Conclusion: i think that mona lisa probably was a hard picture to face scan because there were so many differnt copys of the original paintning but im pretty sure the real painting is in a museum heavinly gauarded by people with heavy artilllery and grenades and army men with truck but inconclusion if your a great painter do your best because one day u might a famouse painter like Leanardo da Vinci or bettter   
2499	It was me and my other scientist friends in the lab discussing the ''The Face on Mars'' I told them it was just a enormous rock that was two miles long that's all we usullaly see things like this and they kept responding it does have a mouth, head, and eyes so what should we think. 
2500	Eh, its cool, sorta but knowing me I really dont care about this facial action coding thing. I wanna find out the mood of the picture on my own. 
2501	Venus is a very hot planet. If a blimp was 30 miles above Venus, the temperture could still reach the blimp. That is not survivable for humans 
2502	To study Venus, scientists would need samples of rock, gas, or anthing else from Venus. On the other hand, there has been spacecrafts to land on Venus, but they only would survive for a couple of hours.  
2503	"The story about ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" describe how a new technology called the Facial Action Coding System enable computers to indentify humans emotion by writing a essay arguing weather the use of this technology or to read the emotional expression ? "
2504	Like if the computer no if im happy or sad in my emotion then thats a be a good feeling I dont know why but it will 
2505	Like on her last asignment she could feel not knowing how to do things .Then you can calculate emotions like the math homework . In the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face in if you dont know how to work a app it will show you . 
2506	"If you do good things like help the teacher out they might take a picture and post you on there, saying something like ""This person helped me do something difficult"". "
2507	These are some of the reasons why i think it is a good idea that we should limit the usage in this world because there are so many pro's and cons on why its a good/bad idea.    
2508	Another piece of evidence is how we first found this technology back in paragraph one the very end of it we get some background information on how this technology was found. 
2509	and a lot of people think its by aliens and then a lot of people agree with me also. 
2510	. We do not know what this planet is capble of and whats on the planet of mars. Well I think that it wasnt made by aliens becuase it gets more noticable by the years pass then it dissappers in a different year. Well Im sure our planet looks different from space in different years. 
2511	Why would aliens even want to put a face on the planet. Im sure if there was aliens on mars they would'nt be carving a face on there own planet 
2512	Im sure there living there life on mars not knowing we even exsit thats if there is aliens on there. They wouldnt what anything with us if they did I think they would have made more signs then just two dots and a straight line and they would have made the face more noticable and it dissapears after a couple of years that is probbaly of there is wind or something that might have blew away they face 
2513	This device could become useful to see how people felt in movies, books, or even paintings. 
2514	Even if something made a kid feel happy that something bad happened to another student like personal thoughts , that could be blown out of context. 
2515	because Venus is simple to see from the distant but safe vantage point of earth. However, it has proved a very challenging place to examine more closely. 
2516	"Often referred to as Earth's ""twin,"" Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size.  A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus. Even more challengin are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venu's atmosphere. On the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet. These conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth; such a enviroment would crush even a submarine accustomed to diving to the deepest parts of our oceans and would liquefy many metals. "
2517	 Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value, not only because off the insight to eb gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors. Our travels on earth and beyond should not be limited by danger and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation. 
2518	Meaning it's not that far away to reach.  
2519	However one statement from paragraph 4 that shows that they wanna go to Venus is 
2520	"In paragraph 5 though, one of the statement claims ""not easy conditions, but survivable for humans."" Stating that Venus's climate and other factors made being there a pain, but again, it's for sure possible.  In paragraph 5 as well it says ""(NASA) has one particularly compelling idea for sending humans to study Venus."" "
2521	Going a little further, paragraph 6 just explains that to understand more about Venus, that they would have to get much closer, and also describes how scientists are working on innovations that would make the tech and gear that is necessary better and able to last longer.  They are doing so because they can't understand as much when they have no evidence 
2522	Paragraph 7 has no claims on how you should go to Venus whatsoever, but instead it is talking about older tech used in the 1800s. 
2523	"However in Conclusion, in paragraph 8 they stated ""Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors."" Another line that they used is ""Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubt. "
2524	"This machine found out that she was 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry. This software is the latest innovation from Prof. Nicu Sebe of the University of Amsterdam. This software actually calculates peoples emotions like a math homework. The process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face; all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles, Movement of one or more muscles is called an ""action unit"". "
2525	Not everyone wants to read about Venus, but it is a nice planet but when you are being forced to it's not the best choice.  
2526	So in the storu it talks about going to diffrenet places in our solar system so in the story it talks about how some plants can actually hold humans in it cuase it has the same things this planet has but not all of them. So they where talking about a planet in particular venus a planet right next to us we can have a spaceship go there. they talk about some of venus things like how hot it is the planet reaches 800 degrees. 
2527	Can we go to a diffrenet planet thats what nasa is trying to figure out 
2528	can we go to a diffrenet planet like in mars venus jupitor all these planets so in this story it talks about how can we go figure out what can be suitable for a human so in this story it talks about how venus can be a good place they got some data in. They talk about some features that earth has like venus has valleys in mountains in craters in paragraph 4 it talks about some of the same features it has with earth. They are looking for more ways they can reserch they are thinking about sending some rovers to look around take pictures of the place in how they can actually go around in check out the planet but the way they been doing is taking pictures from a ship in actually actually looking from close thats what they been doing they still dont want to send people there cuase they dont want to take cuations of someone dying in the planet. 
2529	I'm going to type an essay about an arugement for this technology to read students emotional expressions. The newest software update is called Facial Action Coding System. 
2530	The Mona Lisa is to demonstration is really intended to bring a smile to your face, while showoing how much a computer can do. 
2531	When I went on to be a Seagoing Cowboy, I had my friend Don Reist. He is the one that asked me if I wanted to going with him.  
2532	We could be living on Venus. 
2533	in India there was a kid named Generic_Name, sometime when the teacher was not in the class room. He always help his class mates, one day his teacher give them a project and he decide to do a toy little rocket, also he decide to test the rocket and it worked. And now he win the grand winner award by the President of India. 
2534	in schools teacher are the one who do all the work, and if a student did not do his work, it will be a waste of time for the student and the teacher. If we allow student to make their own work they will know how hard is also they gain experience by doing the project by them self. 
2535	Why Mona never smile in her painting. The artis make Mona smile into art. The artis try to make her happy into art. Mona sheÂs 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry. The Mona Lisa demonstration is really intended to bring a smile to your face, while it shows just how much this computer can do.  The author write about becaues he wants the peolpe to know that there only 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry ina person. The story is best on is trying to make you smile. That why the author write this story. The story is about a smile just a girl smile i always see everybody smile everybody. Making mona smile she probalby don't won't to smile.  While looking the in the mirror there a smile in there. Mona smile when happy or angry. Smile is a good thing in your life. two ways to make someone happy in there life be funny, be really funny be like a bunny to make them smile. We peolpe has the same impressive everty day. Imagine a computer that knows when youÂre happy or sad. If there a computer know when you're happy or sad that's kinda cool.  A new technology called the facial action coding system enables computers to identify human emotions. 
2536	That is kinda funny how can a computers know when your sad or happy. Computers don't have emotions only living things do have emotions.  
2537	SInce now that Professor Thomas Huang's technology can calculate the tiniest emotions, it can support us dramatically. 
2538	They want to floaut above the fray.  Wouldn't be easy conditions, but not hard enough to kill humans.  
2539	Can you believe that schools are now making students stay after-school to participate in an extracurricular activity. 
2540	Luke Bomberger used to be an average teenager working two part-time jobs. Then his friend, Don Reist, came and asked him if he wanted to be a 'Seagoing Cowboy', or one who helps bring livestock to war victims in Europe. Luke then took this as an opportunity of a lifetime and couldn't resist.  The Seagoing Cowboys are a group of people who take care of livestock that were being shipped overseas to help the many that were devastated by the war in Europe. This livestock included young cows, horses, and mules. Shortly after Don and Luke found out about the Seagoing Cowboys, they then both signed up. LIttle did Luke and Don know, this job had a lot of risks.  The Seagoing Cowboys were a great part of an even greater orginization, the UNRRA, or the United Nations Relief and Rehibilitation Adminisrtation. This orginization was made up of 44 nations. This orginization also helped relieve and rehibilltate the devastated families of Europe. Luke knew what he was doing was a great cause, but did he know that going across the Atlantic and the Pacific oceans was a very risky thing. Luke could have had second thoughts about the risks that he was taking, but he wasn't doing it for himself, he was doing it for the people that needed his help.   
2541	No matter if Venus dangers could be extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth, it is the most talk about planet to study it's worthy pursuit, With sights that once was familiar like Earth and various forms of life that has the humans curiousity on Venus.   
2542	After this decision starts getting enforced, every student will be able to find something they like!  
2543	Meeting those new people and having that special diversity will bring lots of students together and form unimaginable new bonds, friendships and relationships. 
2544	I found some information about why we can't text and drive. 
2545	The fact that this tecnoligy is avalible to human kind is amizing it can be used in many ways 
2546	its amazing isn't it all we have to do is take a picture and voala we know what the choice is because if he is being truethfull we can say yes he fits but if he is lying we know that we have to make a better choice that just vote on him right of way . 
2547	Can you emagine being able to use this like for more than just polotitions like maybe the presedent or a school teacher a dilinquent or maybe even a spouse. 
2548	but it is stil amazing because they wont have to do much just snap a picture and thee program will caulculate it think about how many crimes this will solve . 
2549	In conclusion this invention is revolutionary program will have a huge inpact in every social aspect. The world wont be the same every thing will be diffrent because we will now what the presedent is really thinking and when he is lying or when he is scared and then we can better protect our selves . 
2550	"In the article ""The Challenge od Exploring Venus,"" the author states that NASA has a compelling idea to send humans to Venus to study it."" "
2551	This article of ''Making Mona Lisa Smile'' it talks about how a computer seastem can raed student emotional expressions such a Mona lisa emotion. 
2552	This sieastem can recognize emotions whether you're angry, happy, surprise, disgust, fearles and ect. This process begins when the computer constrac a 3-D computer model of the face. all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles. Action unit are movement of one ore more muscle. Dr. Huang relies on the work of psychologists, such as Dr. Paul Eckman wich are the creators of FACS.  Dr. Eckman has classified six basic emotions; happines, surprise, anger, disgust, fear and sadness and then associated each with characteristic movements of the facial muscles. For example, your frontalis pars lateralis muscle, above your eyes, reased your eyebrows whe you surprise also your orbicularis around your mouth, and tightens your lips to sho anger. This example we can se it in the firts pharaghaph when it talks when shes 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful and r percent angry. 
2553	And yeah i dont have nothing to arguing because i think the cumputer is a good a idea for student because it can tell whether the emotions are 
2554	Thats what i think about this article of ''Making the Mona Lisa smile''.   
2555	In the previous paragraph, the author informs the readers about an idea that NASA has thought of. 
2556	Students should try something new instead of doing nothing 
2557	they can help you meet and befriendÂ new people 
2558	and they can help kids find potential ideas and hobbies. 
2559	often times emotions are the reflection of the human spirit emotions are things that leads rebilons agaimts broken systems or start movements,emotions are what gives us the extra inch for the push, emotions soemtimes give a door to grieve, our even hold our opinons , see we have feelings inside that no one should look threw in todays society alot of mans virutues once held have gone, emotions are something that is deep imside us that we can hold onto , humanity always wants to know even it breaks or passes the limit but , if emotions were able to show they could stop so much possibilties , imagine if slave masters knew their slaves emotions, or britian during the american revoultion knew, emotitons is how cover ourselves . 
2560	Agree or disagree? 
2561	there are many benifits of doing this act. At the same time there might be some small downsides to going on this trip. 
2562	Lets just get the not so good facts out of the way. 
2563	I think that having communityes without cars is great for the inviroment and if people want to do that then good for them. but i dont think i could survive with out a car 
2564	and i dont think many people could just to get to work it may take and 1 hour- 30 minutes to get there. but if there was a community where no one had a car and everyone rode there bike ir walked. Then there would be no reason to have a car because then all your job oppertunitys would be close by and you would not need to drive to get there. So i really dont see my self ever being able to go and doing somethuing like not using a car.  but if thats what people want to do then thats good for them. i want people as a whole to be happy. i think that we can make our own decisions in our life and you know what people should not be judging someone else for there life decisions. its your life live it how you want i really makes me mad when people start getting mad at someone for something they have done because if it has already beeen done they cant go back and change it. it is already done and thats not cool. 
2565	If I was an anstronount I would love to explore venus because it would be fun to be walking on venus. 
2566	Most people should join venus just to see how it look and how is it 
2567	I think NASA  as our jet airplanes travel at higher altitude to fly over many storms to go into space and explore many plants. 
2568	The national aeronautics and space administartion have done a great job when they go into space and discover planets 
2569	I think it is very cool to go on other planets venus is sometimes closers to mars. The earth rotated its self and people dont nocited it.  The sun is the hottest planet in the solar system it is over 100's degrees. Long ago venus was probaly coverd largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life just like earth. 
2570	Venus, a planet, also know was Evening Star, is one of the brightest points of light in the night sky which is a misleading point since Venus is a planet thats is the second planet from our sun and often referred as Earth's twin due it being the closest planet to Earth in terms of its density and size and its occasionally distance as well. In space terms Venus is considered to be right around corner which has lead to humans sending many of their spacecraft to land their spacecraft on Venus which caused each previous mission to be considered unmanned mainly because no spacecraft has survived the landing for more than a few hours and as a result it explains the reason why not a single spaceship has touched down on Venus in more than three decades 
2571	Venus has conditions that are far more extreme than anything humans can encounter on Earth 
2572	also notable Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system, even though Mercury is closer to our sun. Mercury planet surface temperature averages over 8000 degrees Fahrenheit and the atomsphereic pressure that is 90 times greature than we experience on our planet and such an environment would even crush a subermarine that is made to explore the deepest parts of our oceans and would liquefy many metals. Venus has a thick atmosphere that is made of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide and blankets Venus. The most challenging are the clouds that are highly corrosive sulfuric acid in VenusÂ´s atmosphere. Venus geology and weather introduces natural disaters such as erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes and frequent lightning strikes, which makes it harder to land on Venus without experiencing one of these dangers. 
2573	astronomers are fascinated by Venus because they believed it was once have been the most Earth-like planets 
2574	Astronomers also believed Venus was once covered largely with Oceans could have supported various form of life we may have not been familiar with just like on Earth. Venus also some things that are simlar to Earth such as the rocky surface that include familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters. Venus can also be considered our nearest option for a planetary visit, which is a crucial consideration given the long time frames of space travel.  
2575	Trying to exceed the challenges showned by Venus has its uses because human cruiosity will likely lead us into many equally problems in the futures. and our adventures on Earth should be limited by dangers and doubts but a determination of that should expand our very limits.   
2576	for instance many expect public transport serving the suburds to play a larg role in a six-year federal transportion bill als one of the places for limited cars is apart in paris suggested that on monday mortorists with even numbered license plates are ordered to leave there vechlies at there home or get punish with a fine of 31$ the same thing will apply to odd plates the next day. studies shows that 4,000 people with cars had theire car impounded with a high fine plus tax in bogota cars have beeb banned with only buses and taxies are the only two transpotion are allwoed studies showed that fewer of americans are getting cars and driving less even lees and less people are getting licenses year by year studies are now pointing is americans passed peaking point? thats is still uncertain for now,some places in new york shows that bike sharing programs and ints shyrocketing bridge and tunnels tolls reflected thode new priorities as they do prolifered of cars sharing the same programs across the nation and we do see a high percentage of it droping down like apples. reaches showed that they found that young people that are driving decreased of by 23 percent since the year of 01 to 09 in an article i read showed that moblie world last year in oversees sports suggiested a business plan in a world in which vehicles ownership is impractical and public transporation save the system more money and lower the risk of danger. 
2577	Many schools will have no point of having this being in their computer system. This is why many schools will most likely reject this idea. Another reaosn, is that schools will have no benfit of having this for their students. This is why having this new technology is completely useless. These reason show why the the use of this technology is useless. 
2578	Venus is worth studying 
2579	"when they study it they called it an ""Evening Star"" also a ""twin"" of earth "
2580	If no one helped her in her bad times or no askedÂ whats wrong, then who knows if she still be in school. 
2581	In the story the aurther is describing why Venus is the 2nd Earth 
2582	and there coomon and there diffrents and what would be the best matterial to use for the Vehicle Witch Nasa is working with some simplified electrons made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus surface and have lasted for 3 weeks in such conditions . Then Nasa also has a nother project were they are looking to work with the old technology called mechanical computers werefirst envisioned in the 1800's and played a inportant part in the 1940s during the World war ll. But the reason for the old tecnolagy is because if we were to have a cell phone on Venus is because it would melt because of the acid or heat capable of meting tin. 
2583	because even though we express ourselves so easily however those of us with ability manipulate others and or manipulate the technology it self like hacking or reprogrammming data based and operating systems of the computer which by the way is softer that completly allows the hardware and software talk to each other examples of operating systems is Microsoft's Windows 10 and Apple's Mac os X or as I call it Mac os 10 because X in roman numbers means 10 can be hacked by viruses and malware and worst of all ransomware itself and we all know for every key you bet their is always a lock and vice versa why do you think computer security specialist exist to work and counter each other for sake of technology. 
2584	because these technologies that help us as people aren't always helping like there is always something wrong with technology 
2585	as also talked in paragraph number 3 emotions are discovered when our muscles move certain way our body instinctively tells us to do so 
2586	not fully instinctlively because our thoughts and nerves go so fast we sometimes in instant gratification stuff lose precious time to react when needed to and our nerves and speed of the nerves why we is limited by our very own fixed speed and thoughts and emotions and stuff. Also paragraph 4 says each facial expression is universal so even though we all have similar look when happy sad, angry , depresssed doesn't mean all angry and depressed people look same and we can hide or have our feelings mixed up with so much thoughts in our head that is happening. 
2587	In conclusion i feel that we should just leave everything as it is in our schools 
2588	"In paragraph one the experts states that ""She's 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry. Meaning this data isn't just something from a lab science teacher this is acurrate data from a new coming modern software. "
2589	This explains why exploring Venus could be a good reason or a bad reason. 
2590	The passage states that they have been succesful in three decades. It is a very challenging plant for humans to study. The atmosphere makes it even worse to travel through it being 97 persent carbon dioxide. The preasure from it is 90 percent worse even on top of that it can reach up to 800 degrees fahrenheit. 
2591	They say Venus has value because human curiosity will likely lead into intimidating endeavors. They also say that even though there are dangers here that means that we shouldn't stop what we are doing we keep pushing. They also say beacuse of doubts they shouldn't give up. If a spacecraft can't stay there for more than two hours then how do you explore it with out having risks. This could put people in dnager. 
2592	Days later NASA let the picture out for the world to see. The picture went viral within days. This had become one of the most famous talked about things in the world. It appeared in books, magazines, radio talks, shows, etc. 
2593	There were very few scientists who believed the Face could've been an alien artifact, but photographing Cydonia became a major priority for NASA. On April 5, 1998, Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the very first time. 
2594	To me, I'd thought that it wouldn't be worth all the trouble to study more of this when we can study other planets like mars that support life better than Venus since it's surface and atmosphere wasn't as crazy as Venus'. 
2595	This would be one easy way students can detect emotions. 
2596	but if they think about it instead of waisting your time just guessing what their emotions are you would know if they use the proper techonology. They had made a process that began when the computer constructed a 3-D computer model of the face and it showed that all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles. 
2597	As you can see its so easy to see their emotions or how they feel. They even show different weighting of units. 
2598	The author says that the Mona Lisa demonstrates is really to bring a smile to peoples face while it shows how much the computer can do. 
2599	It would be really strange if a computer can tell you if your happy or sad.  
2600	I have mixed feelings about the FACS technology it could be great now but when people or robots with their own minds want to do bad or harm the people of the world this would be a great start. 
2601	But the good side I heve for this technology is that it can help people. Or help people to help other people. 
2602	As said in paragraph 8 you use different muscles for a genuine smile than for a false or fake one. It can be used by the FBI in interviewing or interogation. Or you could see when a politician is faking it also conveyed in pagraph 8. 
2603	So yeah, I dont really know how to feel. There's bad good way this thing couls affect the world. But there's pro and cons to everything I guess. 
2604	Imagine being able to detect what other people are feeling? She's 83 % happy,9% disgusted,6% fearful and 2% angry. How does this computer tell all this information if this painting was painted hundred of years ago? 
2605	Making up fake stories for publicity is extremely wrong. If theres no evidence of something being fake, than just belive that it is real. Theres more to the world than people think and believe. 
2606	The first thing im gonna talk about is in the store it sayed they took there right to drive away and fined them if they do drive that is stupid. 
2607	If u pay for that car or truck and pay for the the gas that they sale you should be able to drive that car or truck wherever u want to. And if they new it was gonna cause harm to the environment then why did they do it i mean that's pretty dumb. They new that them hazardous gasses and fumes were gonna mess things up so why would they do it.  But u have to have these vehicles and semis to be able to transport goods from place to place do i mean your really just gonna have to deal with it cause u have to have them cause whose gonna hall all that stuff by hand one by one nobody and its just a waste of time cause u would kill yourself trying to do it so why not just use a semi that uses left over stuff from gas that way there not dumping all that stuff out on the ground ans its not going down and pouluting our water let it puluote our air but if we don't have that water we couldnt go 3 days and we could were gas masks if it come down to it its really not that big of a deal.  There making this how smog thing a big deal they can come up with something to help that or go away that is just so stupid that they do that cause they can prevent some of it with safe idle and emmisind but they dont want to hold to there laws ad people that are doing it they just let them go on like there doing and they do nothing about. Why would they do wat they are doing and not help us out and quit taking our rights away.       
2608	In 1976 are satilite the viking 1 was orbiting mars and takeing pictures of the planet. When we looked at them we noticed this one. A picture of a face on mars. When we noticed it eas just a mesa in the face. 
2609	"The article ""A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves"" talks about a boy named Luck who recently graduated high school. Luck worked two part-time jobs in a grocery store and a bank, when Don Reist Luck's friend invited him to go to Europe on a cattle boat Luck could never said no, because he knew it was an opportunity of a lifetime.  To help the European cuntires recover from World War 2,the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration hired ""Seagoing Cowboys"" to transport the horses,young cows,and mules Luck and Don signed up.  Luck and Don received their ordes to repot to New Orleans, they arrived August 14,the day the Pacific War ended. They were headed for Greece with a cargo of 335 horses plus enough hay and oats to feed them.  Luck had just turned eighteen before they arriving in Greece. By the time he was discharged in '47  Luke had made nine trips. To past the time on return trips they would play baseball, volleyball,table-tennis tournaments,fencing boxing ,reading whitting and games also helped to pass the time. "
2610	Luck had the most amazing two years of his life. 
2611	so tell me this what do you think we should do keep on leting technology teel us how we feel or go deep down in your heart in tell yourself how you really feel. but i don't thing that the people that say yes we should let technolgy tell us what we should feel. they are never goingto give up on leting technology tell them how they are going to feel. 
2612	Humans live on Earth so Humans could have lived on Venus, which makes it not dangerous. 
2613	Does the Facial Acton Coding really identify humans emotions 
2614	The Facial Action Coding really helps identify human emotions 
2615	Since some people can't identify or know if your happy,sad,angry,surprise,shock,disgust, and scared they won't be able to know your emotions. 
2616	But some people will start thinking about the Facial Action Coding will malfunction on them and they won't be able to identify their emotions. 
2617	"For example, if you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a similar add might follow. Dr. Huang predict that "" A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored."" Another prediction that Dr. Huang did was that ""Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" Every human or most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication. "
2618	"Twenty five years ago something funny happened around Mars. NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft was circling the planet snapping pictures of possible landing sites for Viking 2, then it spotted a shadowy likeness of a human face. An enormous head nearly two miles from end to end. It seemed to be staring back at the cameras on Viking 1. These photos were taken from the region of the Red Planet called Cydonia.  Viking 1 took a picture of something call a butte or mesa. They're most common in the American West. It's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on mars. Their is one in the Snake RIver Plain in Idaho.  On April 5, 1998, when Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos.  ""As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 rimes larger than the pixel size. If there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!"" said Jim Garvin.  The picture actually shows is the Martian Equivalent of a butte or mesa. This landform is most common in the American west. ""It reminds me most of the MIddle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho,"" says Jim Garvin.      "
2619	Today age driving is one of the things you need in life if you travel a lot and go from place to place. 
2620	The computor for the students can be a interesting dissision for video imagery. 
2621	The last thing about the computor for the students is that they can be a reowned drama coach. 
2622	"The artical saids"" Constantin Stanislavsky, had his actors carefully reproduce smiling and frowning as a way of creating these emotions on stage. Empathy may happen because we unconsciously imitate another person's facial expressions""(Makeing Mona Lisa Smile 9).Therefore it explains that the computor can be a reowned drama coach because the computor is carfully produce of the emotions on stage.  "
2623	We already can't stop all the people that use their phones while they drive and now a days more and more people are getting addicted to their phones almost making it impossible to put down even while just having a simple dinner let alone putting it down while there driving most people don't even realize that there even doing 
2624	"under a code of law because there are not enough laws in places or ""fine print"" and they can just say oh well it's like a Bluetooth but it wasn't type of stuff and the court can't do anything about it "
2625	maybe there should a cam in every car that shows whenever your texting and driving or have your phone up against your ear just so if the other person that gets hit they have the cam to see if there were texting or on a call whenever you are driving and get into accident (hopefully no) but still you would have the prove that they were on it meaning the phone or not. 
2626	They (cops) think they can just lie as well but with that cam they can't lie, or anything even know they shouldn't even if it's an exsaturration it still means something in the court of law it could either mean good or bad for the person testifying what they did or didn't do and with that cam there is no more lying anymore and takes away more problems like for example who/what happened before the crash how many people were really in the car and finally how they got hit and out of the car if camera is in correct placement in every car sadly they all have to be in different placement in each variety of car.  
2627	This is what I think and what people should do about cars and phones the true ones would understand this message thank you so much for taking your time to read till again bye.   
2628	The extreme weather conditions on Venus is also similar to the ones on Earth. 
2629	"The text states, ""Beyond high pressure and heat, Venusian geology and weather present additional impediments like erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent ligtning strikes to probes seeking to land on its surface."" This shows that the weather conditions are similar, so this would help the manufactures of the spacecraft be prepaired for the conditions and help build a better craft. Although there are many dangers with every advantage the Venus is still a good planet to try and put living organisims on. "
2630	What both countries are trying to do is limited cars so less polution. 
2631	Its spooky how looking at Mona Lisa picture can express yoiur emotions 
2632	"In source 1: In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars states that street parking, driveways and home garages are generally forbidden near the French and Swiss borders. Vauban's streets are completely ""car free"" as stated in the second paragraph. 57% of people sold their car just to move on Vauban's streets. When Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and a mother two said that ""when she had a car she was always tense. But is much happier this way.""  Vauban, completed in 2006, is an example of growing trend in europe. The United States and elsewhere to seperate suburban life from auto use, as a component of a movement called ""smart planning"" stated in paragraph 4. Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up 50% in some car intensive areas in the United States. When you don't have a car you had to walk to get where you need to go. But when you get a car you dont think about walking because all you wanna do is drive. As stated in paragraph 9, in the United States the Environmental Prtection Agency is promoting ""car reduced"" communities, and legislators are starting to act, if cautiously.  In source 2: Paris bans driving due to smog, states that paris enforced a partial drving ban to clear the air of the global city. In paris on Mondays motorists with even numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22 euro fine ($31). The same would apply to odd numbered plates the following day. Keeping the air clear is very important. 27 people had their cars impounded for their reaction to fine. Car traffic was down 6o percent in the capital of France, after 5 days of intensifying smog. All the smog rivaled Beijing and China which is well know as one of the most polluted cities in the world.  Paris had 147 micrograms of particulate matter per cubic meter compared with 114 in brussels and 79.7 in London, Reuters found.   "
2633	The bad thing of this emotion recognition is that students with medical issues that affects their learning because of it affecting them from using technology. 
2634	For u schools who use this technology have to focus on their students with medical problems that affects them from even using it. 
2635	The good things about having this type of technology in schools is that it have more students be more interested in learning and can help them plan out what they would like to do in their future 
2636	Having the emotion recognition can help students in advanced classes who struggling with their classes have a more easier way for them to pass and graduate with the diploma they wanted. This can technology can have more students graduate and have less high school drop-outs.  
2637	Like, is going to look at every student face, if yes that had be a waste of time cause that would take the whole class period. If no, than do the teachers have to buy a Facial Action Coding System computer for every student. 
2638	In the story The Challenge Of Exploring Venus the authour talks about starts and where they all come from and how the earths twin is closets in the planetray neighbor he also talks about the solar system and ow its the secong planet from the sun and earths twin is the closet planted to the earth distance also he talks alot about hoe thivk the earth is and how everything is almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets.. the sister of the planet is so inhospitable that the scientits started discussing more visits to the surfacde and astronomers where also fascinated by venus because it may well once have een the most earth like planet in our system in paragraph 5 the authour talks about how the air pressure in the sea level and he talk mainy about how the earths survivable for us humans also he includes things about nasa and how everthing is working for the study of venus such as electronics which is made from silicon carbide which has been tested in paragraph 8 hes talking about the striving challenge presented by venus and how it have value but notg only bbecause of human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally 
2639	this story was about diffrent plantes and how eveything is set up also hoe everything be taveling in the earths eveviorments a ns solar systems. 
2640	he provided details of how there is many diffrent ways they can carry out the mission. So, next time that you are setting a just never give up , even if you come cross a challege. 
2641	because a computer that can read all 44 major muscles, and also this is where FACS will come in (Facial Action Coding System.) 
2642	"The ""funny things"" about people is that laughing can be really contagest when you are down in the dirt, and your friend sees that you're just upset, they will do anything to mke you happy they will smile you, make a joke. just to see you smile "
2643	In my opinone I would do it. I would love to go on a trip tio eventure around the world. I love learning new cultres and to see what what it could help me with in my life. Also that it would be cool to do a report on all the places that you whent to in the proses. If I were him or any one els that got the opertunity I would say yes to doing it. 
2644	Just one time at a different place then were you live is awesome because you never want to leave. You could also go see uther animal sthat you have never seen befor in a zoo or that you have never herd of too. I love to see knew thing even if I have heard of it,or not, or seen it, or not it is still really cool to experiance that. An I think kids, aldolts, teens, or eve the elderl would stil love to see that or experiance that time with the family.  
2645	"A shadow could have been reflecting off the viking 1 while it was taking this photo of the ""Face"", or maybe the shadows were from a bigger land form. that was infront, behind, or on the sides casting a shadow onto this mesa. "
2646	One postive example of  Venus is called the evening star is one the brightest ponits of light in the night sky making it simple for even an amater stragazer to spot 
2647	Second Venus is called the earth twins. why do you ask? Earth in terms of density and size and occasionally the closet in distance too. 
2648	Earth and Venus and Mars are other planetary neighbor who they orbit the sun at different speeds.  The difference in speed from earth to venus is that sometimes we are closer to mars and other times to venus is close to earth 
2649	The pros of cars are by far outweighed by the cons, if you look at them in the long run. 
2650	That is my argument to not be a Seagoing Cowboy.    
2651	This stroy is talking abour a planet name Venus 
2652	Thier saying that Venus is the Brightest in the evening. Venus is the secound plaent form the sun. Sicencetest are saying that Venus is like Earth's tiwn?.Earth and Venus have the same terms of density and size and occasionally Fomr the closest in distance too.  NASA is wroking on approaching and study Venus. Tos see what dose it have in the air or dose it have and disaes. The aother projects is looking back to an old technology called the mechanical Computers. These devices were first envisioned in the 1800s and played an inprtan role in the 1940s during World War ||.They are going to meet challenges oresented by venus has value and its not only because of the insight by gaind on the plaent itself. 
2653	On Earths travels and beyound should not be Be limited by dangers travels abd doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of the imantion. 
2654	in the u. s. it is a law that you have to have your phone down from your hands while driving or at least have a Bluetooth device that can connect to your phone to your car so you don't have to look at your phone to call or answer a call while your driving a car 
2655	In this article they share about the Facial Acting Coding System. They ask us if we agree with it or not. 
2656	This system can be compareded to peoples thoughts on what some are feeling. 
2657	There are some people that can almost do the same as this. But this system can do it pretty fast and tell yus exactly everything. They say when you do this you move your muscles and whatever ones you usae can make you happy. Which I think is cool and smart. 
2658	The idea of studying Venus is a very scary idea because of all the dangers it can cuase for humans to get close to the very hot and stormy planet. 
2659	One of the dangers of going on a cattle boat though is being out in the middle of the sea so you always have to watch your back and becareful what you do. 
2660	"Venus is an second planet for the sun. Sometime Venus is called the ""Evening  Star,"" because Venus is one of the brightest points on light in the night sky. Venus also have a nickname like other planets have different nicknames. Venus nickname is misleading.  -  Earth, Venus, and Mars are our other planetary neighbor, they orbit in a different speeds. there is a time when Mars is getting closer to our planet Earth and there is a time when Venus is getting closer to the Earth.  Often Venus referred to as Earth's twin because Venus is the closest planet to  Earth in a size and occasionlly the closest in distance.  -  Like other planets have atmosphere and different temperture, Venus also have atmospere and differents temperture. When a spaceship when to Venus it couldn't survived the landing for more than a few hours because unlike Venus's surface is hottest in our solar system even though Mercury is closer to our sun.  A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus.  Venus's clouds are highly corrosive sulfuric acid in it atmosphere. "
2661	Venus may be dangerous but sometime it can be our nearest option for a planetary visit. 
2662	"If the ""face' on mars was created by alliens it would look a lot different. "
2663	"Many people think alliens look weird, Well the ""face"" on mars wastn't so weird looking. It looked almost like a human face. You would think that alliens would make something radical and not just a face in their planet. Many people seem to believe that they would make something simple. "
2664	If you think that alliens made the landform, I would suggest you look at the picture more closely. Just because its on a planet like mars doesnt mean it was made by an allien. 
2665	I mean how many people actually believe in alliens anyway? If you've never seen them how do you know if they even exist? Take another quick look at the picture tell what you think. Is it even possible for alliens to be alive even if it is on another planet? 
2666	Another example is reading different emotions is some how very important. It can be used against people who have commited crime. 
2667	Another reason why you should believe that the face on Mars is real is because the Jet Propulsion Lab saw the face on their motor 
2668	The said it looked like an Egyptian Pharoah.  
2669	"The ""Face on Mars"" has become popular. "
2670	It is now in films, magazines, books, talk shows, and haunted grocery stores. The face on Mars is a natural landform. Many people have experienced the face that appears on the planet of Mars. 
2671	inclusivity 
2672	Earth is the only plant that humans can stand ,talk,walk and breath on by your self with no help . haves 800 degree farenheit when lading from space while the perssure will be 90 times greater with the atmopheric 
2673	some peoole want to know is other plants save to vist . 
2674	Mars ,Venus are the close to earth neigboor from speed of time mars be closer to earth then others venues closer to earth . Veuns has the hottest landing point temperture in the solar system .veunes try living there your car woul be floating 30 20 feet above the floor .venus do have features as like earth rocky mountains valleys craters 
2675	some say we may can vist that plant soon.  
2676	The NASA has only one particularly compeliing to study whats beyond what people dont see or dont know for hummans can travel to other plants 
2677	earth the best to keep all living goods in things, poeple ,and creachers alive 
2678	Thats why its good for people to studdy about thinks an just do so they would know what they getting into .earth right now never sound back to me but earing an learing about differnt plants that maybe we might be able to vist in years is aswome to learn an hear about that its not just one plant we could live on. 
2679	Another advantage is car traveling is becoming less nessasary because of citys like New York and new and improved telecommuting methods. 
2680	"car usage is becoming less popular, this is because of ""no car days"" and people just not bothering to get a car or a license. "
2681	Sometimes, somethings are better left unexplored because it could have risks that people don't even know of. 
2682	In conclusion, despite how many times people have tried to land rovers and machines on Venus, they will one day find a way to perfect those machines and may be able to send a person up there to gather further research on the planet. 
2683	In parapgraph one in the beginning of the sentnce it gives you bunch of facial expressions that Mona is giving. The software indicates several expressions that she is making. In paragraph 3 says when the process begins, the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face. They recognize the the muscles and what the face is expressing. 
2684	"Says in paragraph 6,""The Mona Lisa demonstration is really intended to bring a smile to your face, while it shows how much this computer can do."" Really it even says imagine a computer knowing when your happy or sad, to me thats just invasion to a person, you can always tell you how you are feeling and many just decide to keep them to themselves.  "
2685	Many people have their way of expressing themselves and sometimes you can be curious of how they're feeling. Which is good because the more you look at something you study it and you put piece and piece together until you solve it. Look at pragraph 7, it gives you something to do while your looking in the mirror, to make a face expression, and the face they told you to make was smiling. It's showing how easily you can describe someone face just by describing the face and the muscle form. It's not always good for everyone to know what you're face is expressing because thats just dull. It's not important for people to know, which will just make you more curious of you 
2686	Just as long as you know what your feeling, and thats what I think the artist that did this painting was trying to achieve. 
2687	Students should or should or should not do at least one extracrrcular activity 
2688	My seconed reason is becuase reason a article can halp people feel better if they pay good attions to what the story says. 
2689	my last reason is becuase showing feelings they the way we look.  
2690	My first reason it can help students becuase by the way people read the story and look at the foto there is a lot of ways to look and read it. 
2691	If there is a person who really is feeling sad they can read a story that has a lil og exititing moments on the story and with happy pictues that shows the feelings of the story. It can help alot beuase by looking at the pictuce and really paying attintion to the story it can grab the readers attintion. Once th author got the readers attiontion the reader is going to be focesed of what the book is about and going to make them change their feelings. 
2692	My seconed reason by reading the article it can change feelings. 
2693	It can make then get into the feeling they want to get into eather it can be mad, sad, happy scared, exited, ect. There is a lot of feeling people can get into if they into what the author want to tell them by reading. 
2694	My last reason is by the way they look 
2695	Not alot of the people show they way they feel. If people dont show how they feel it becuase most of the idea is becuase hey are holding there feelings down deep in them. If they not showing it most people say they dont show it because they dont want to make people worry becuase they are in a bad mood and just dont want to get bothered. They try to show they are stong but deep dow they are holding a hard feelings they they going to remember at some other time becuase they are heoding it in them and they are the people who just dont want to do stuff at a surten time. The people who show there feeings i think they are the people who have the most good time becuase they get rid of that feeling. 
2696	Inconcluion that is my three reasons why it think it can help people when they are in the mood they dont want to be in. 
2697	I understand that they want to find a way to stop having so much smog in the area. But I mean, what's the point? You can't catch everyone that is out on a certain day that isn't in the right vehicle or has the right numbers on their lisence plate. I think it's so ridicoulus that people should even have to assign days when people can leave or when they can't leave. 
2698	This history is about Venus 
2699	NASA is trying to go to the planet call Venus because is the planet that look just like Earth. 
2700	"They want to go because they want to show how Venus look like. So people can go live in Venus, but NASA don't want to send people because is so danger.  In the solar system Venus is the second plane from the sun.  Venus is call the ""Evening Star"" because it is the brightest point of light in the night sky.  It is the twin planet of the Earth because it have the same side of the Earth, and in distance is the closed plane that Earth have.  ""Each previous mission was unmanned, and good reason, since no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours.  Venus have 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets. On other planets the temperature average is about 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric is abuot 90 times greater than what we experience.  ""Also Venus have the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system, even Mecury is closer to our sun.  Long time ago Venus was probably covered by ocean and could have supported varius forms of life, just like Earth.  NASA is trying to make mechanical computer the ones that help a lot in WW II, so they don't have to used people, but they have to use more tegnology.  "
2701	Venus is a planet that will soon be explored NASA has been sending spacecrafts to land on venus but they still don't make it, 
2702	It has natural grow 
2703	Even if its just a homework club. 
2704	My advice to people is if you have to try to be someone friend there not your friend. 
2705	I disagree.Â  
2706	"At first this was a very succesful and popular image, a section from the article states that "" The Face On Mars has becoma a pop icon, that starred in a Hollywood film, appeared in books, magazines, radio talk show and even haunted stores for 25 years"". this states that this photo was a clear sign of Extarestrial life, at least at the time.  "
2707	sorry to burtst your bubble but, you are wrong. 
2708	Did you know that 6 out of 10 kids do extracurricular activities? 
2709	And as well as fixing some problems at home because there are cases where some of the emotional problems transfer in to school and impare the student to learn. 
2710	Cellphones being used while driving should be given a huge ticket fine and be given court for putting their lives and someone else live in danger or should even be put behind bars. Cellphones should be put on do not disturb when operating a motor vehicle. 
2711	But other conspiricy theorists think otherwise. 
2712	The article mentions that the Face on Mars is located at 41 degrees north martian latitude. It was apparently winter there in April of '98. 
2713	I think the auther is being very un biased about wether or not we should go to venus. 
2714	"When they called Venus ""Evening Star"" beacause during the evening you could see Venus so clear. The reason why you could seen Venus not just because how bright Venus was but also because Venus is closer to us then you think. BUt the point of the nickname is because Venus is a misleading panet in our solar system.  We say that Earth and Venus are twins because Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size. People might think that when we say twins they might think that everything is the say on Venus but nobody know how Venus looks like because everytime we send the spacecraft in only last for a few hours. Never enough hours or days to see everything we want to see and view. The speed of Venus ""means orbit the sun at different speeds."" This probably mean why not spaceship don't last for very long in Venus.  ""The atmosphere on Earth 97 percent dioxide blankets Venus. "
2715	"If students had a choice to pick a summer project or let the teacher decide I am pretty sure most if not all of the students will let them selfÂ choose. I remember when I was in like 5th or 6th grade and my teacher was like ""I know its the end of the year but you guys and girls are gonna have to do a summer project"". After she said that everyone hated her for the rest if the summer and not just because she gave us a summer project but also because it was very boring "
2716	you go travel on the boat ride home and back but, you don't have to go sit around and watch from the boat. When you get off the boat you have a reward. If you like to see stuff like Europe, Italy, China, Greece then you'll love it. If you don't believe me ask Luke he's the one whos been to all those places. He said that the boat trips were so unbelievable for a small town boy like him.  
2717	Like bring them food, water, and animals. It all ways feels good to help people in your own way. But it really effects peoples lives in the way you can help them. And it really doesn't take much to help those people. 
2718	This gives a Venus a good persuit but it dangerous. 
2719	Venus can be a good planet to discver in the article it mentions that we us has human beings, havent touch the surface of Venus. The author also gives us the similarites that Venus had before Earth was around. 
2720	My second reason is, things in outer space pictures are going to be a lot bigger than in reality. 
2721	Take the sun for an example, we see the sun ten times smaller than it really is. If the sun was just as small as we presume it is, then how would planets, that are thousands of light years away, possibly get warm?  
2722	If, somewhere way far out in space, or even just one planet away, wouldn't we have had a lot more pictures, videos, and newspaper articles about aliens? 
2723	dont u think beignable to have your scholl education chagne and be for what u can exsell in, 
2724	if not that than at lest being able to change it up a lil bit to keep every kid on trck and eger to learn more. 
2725	this comuter programe could help so many people be and do the best thay can at what they love. 
2726	to start this kind of teaching now would most liky be a very costly proseger, but defanitly be worth evey last panny for the new breed of student, born of respect and hunger for the knowlege at hand. 
2727	It is an innovative idea from may people to cut down on the use of a motor vehicle 
2728	This whole thing is point less how they have us in here for two days im missing my education. We could have finished this in one day and had the rest of the week to get back on the track of learning. I've missed both days of weight lifting, algebra, and my world history that i do not want to fail again! If their are any people actually gonna sit down and take the time to read this then  DO NOT DO THIS NEXT YEAR  .  They are giving us cold lunches. ham and cheese and an apple, I am 16 years old and my body needs proper food. I wouldnt be complaining if they served actual breakfast. but because of Michelle Obama and her healthy diet rule they surve us 1 poptart in the moring. How does the school board expect us to last from 7:05-12:15 on a pop tart? then expect us to get A's, we are more focused on lunch than anything else. I am about done so if you have the time to read this even though this does not count. Bring PROPER_NAME a big Mac from mc donalds, SCHOOL_NAME, (idk area code but its in florida)       Â     
2729	Summer projects often receive mixed opinions among students and teachers alike. There is an ongoing debate on whether these summer projects should be teacher-designed or student-designed. 
2730	Should you be able to text and drive? 
2731	Once I served as night watchman. i had to check on the animals every hour. Once I slid down a slipery lader and almost fell overbord. I was cought by an pice of metal. 
2732	they are stating that they dont need cars to go where the need to go because they can use other things. They also are saying that they're not contributing toward the pollution. 
2733	In A COWBOY WHO RODE THE WAVE there was a boy named Luke, he was invited to go to a ones in a lifetime opportunity .He was invited by his friend Don Reist to go on the trip. they were going to go on a cattle boat ,and help the mules,horses,and young cow. On the trip they would cross the big seas.  In the story it says they where called to go to New Orleans on august 1945 and arrived on august,14 right before the war ended. When they got thier seaman papers they were sent to go on the SS Charles W.Woosterand. They headed to greece with a load of 335 horses and enough food to keep the horses alive. Ones luke was discharged from the trips he already made 9 journeys threw the sea. In the story it says that luke was the most segoing cowboy.  On his many trips he also saw many places like Europe,China,but luke thought the most speacial one was when he saw the Acropolis in Greece. The whole story was about the adventure of a lifetime that he got to go on. 
2734	when you drive on the road and all of sudden you see a yard sale or a car for sale or anything your thinking first well let me just stop and park on the side of the road. well one thing is one you might ge ticket or in genral areas its just frobiden, but your thinking what can i do?,well when you get yuor first car maybe your thinking i can drive however i want and also where i want then on other hand you just dont care, break the rules. 
2735	now since everything is back to normal then things don't have to be bannned alot anymore so if they can keep the percentage down then evrything is good, if it does go down they can get usage, 
2736	The advantages of limiting car usage is 
2737	the air is more dense and is a huge impediment to currrent efforts to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipes 
2738	"All Americans do is drive everywhere,they never think about how driving effects the air and the temperature of this planet. Maybe we can be like Africa and have nothing at all. Or just maybe appreciate that we actually have something. Why would we ever get rid of cars? I do not know,but i do know that getting rid of cars is really stupid. Well as i was asked im now going to explain to you how getting rid of cars is ""good"".  "
2739	if people would just try it out they might enojy and like it 
2740	but i know most of them well not enjoy or like it at all. 
2741	"A claim for the value of using this technology to read students' emotional expressions are that the computer can detected the emotions of the student because it has a ""Web ad appears"" on the screen of the student's computer, and it can see his/her different emotions by the way their faces are. "
2742	i believe that the people who are trying to go to venus or sent something to venus should do it because you never know what other kids of things are out there and if we dont try news things we wont discover new stuff . 
2743	and if they have doubt that their nort going to make well the new inovations that wont hurt us and it will now longer be dangerous . 
2744	If Earth was to end Venus would possibly be our best choice to go to. 
2745	"In paragraph 8, is states "" Venus has value."" Only because the insight we have so far on Venus is unbelievable. Studying more on this planet may lead us to many equally intimidating endeavors. "
2746	I believe they will and can studying farther than they have in the past years. 
2747	Variouse forms of life, just like earth today, venus has some simliar stuff like earth it has valleys, moutains and craters and scientest think that venus was cover all in water like how earth was million years ago. Venus solar power would be plentiful and radiation would not exceed earth levels,not easy condtions but survival for humans. 
2748	Nasa is also doing still doing studeis today and sending people over there to study the planet to see if the conditons are getting any better or worst so they can studie and any maybe someday the human beigns can live there in another decade once they say the venus is a safe place to visit and live there.  
2749	When you land of venus its dangerous, So people are creating ways that there makigng a ship that will hovering safley around ground condetions that cannot stad the dense of the ground of the atmosphere and rendering phitigraphhy and vidoeography and the most important they cant get smaples on rock,gas or anything else,In that case scientist are seeking to conduct missions on venus.      
2750	Thats not smart. 
2751	Paris enforced a partical driving ban to clear the airr of the global ci ty. If they didnt leave their cars at home they would have been fined for $31.  Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five-years of intensifying smog. China is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world . But paris typically has more smog than other European capitals.. Last week paris had 147 micrograms of particulate matter (PM) per cubic meter .  President Obama's ambitious goals to curb the United States' greenhouse gasemissions, unveiled last week will get a fortuitous assist from an incipient shift in American behavior.  With all these changes, people who stopped car commuting asa result of the recession may find less reasons to resume the habit    
2752	do teachers know that the black community haves like twenty persent of our students in the class room are not going to do the project to help a student during a school break is to go to the student home a give him work or notes to studdy over the break. 
2753	some schools that hand out projects during a school break is not the class that i would want to be in because when the teachers put all that pesure on the student thats what makes us want do the projects when the teacher give it to us.  
2754	The way that the new idea occurs may effect how you do things normally, 
2755	Be safe and put forth your best effort in what you do and what happens. 
2756	the use of a car limit using can help in differentÂ  ways 
2757	"in the story its says that as the population grows more in american they has to be a production in cars to help the person to get to one place to another. but however in january 1995 many americans were cash-strapped due to the decrease in driving along with the unemployed wasnt going to work aanyways as they try to recover underway. in another story it tells how people could live without cars but in germany as one of the family said ""when i had a car i was always tense and im happier this way. As studys show that 70% of familes do not own cars but as well are happy just by walking or riding a bike beacuse cars make up the greenhouse gas. While in the vauban homes are being adopted in order to provide transportation with less spaced parking then walking all of the way to the mall. in america the agency of environmental are staring to promote and also want a ""car reduced"" area where they can help perserve the wild life as 80% of the law has gone to the highway and the other 20% is the transport its self. In other places they have a car-free day which means no cars or transport will be used through out the day as many people would take a bike or walk or even hike as one person said ""its a good opportunity to take away stress along the pollution in the air"" as it shows that there should be a limited usage of cars. As this could impact the world along with the enviorment around it. "
2758	"For starters, the residents in Vaulban, Germany have given up their cars. Street parking, driveways and home garages are generally forbudden in this experimental new district on the outskirts of Freiburg. Vauban's streets are completely ""car free""--except the main thoroughfare. Car ownership is allowed, but there are only two places to park--large garages at the edge of the development, where a car-owner buys a space, for forty thousand dollars, along with a home. As a result, seventy percent of Vauban's families do not own cars, and fifty seven percent sold their cars just to move here. In the passage, ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"", Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and a mother of two, she quotes,"" When I had a car, I was always tense. I'm much happier this way.""  Additionally, Cars are the linchpin of suburbs, where middle-class families from Chicago to Shanghai ten to makeÂ  their homes. Experts say that that is a huge impediment to current efforts to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emmissions from tailpipes. Passenger cars are responsible for twelve percent of the greenhouse gas emissions in Europe, and up to fifty percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States.  Futhermore, after days of near-record pollution, Paris, France enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city. ""Paris bans driving due to smog"" by Robert Duffer, states that congestion was down sixty percent in the capital of France, after just five days of intensifying smog. "
2759	I became a Seagoing Cowboy when me frend invited me to go to Europe on a cattle boat. It was when World War II was going on. Some countries were left to die and had nothing. So they formed the UNRRA and hired ''Seagoing Cowboys.'' Both I and Don Signed up.  In August of 1945, they recived orders to go and report to New Orleans.''We arived August 14,'' Luke recalled ''the day the Pasific War ended.'' They got their seaman's papers and and borded the SS Charles. W. Wooster. They then headed for Greace.  Before I got to Greace he turned 18 wich ment the military could draft me .''When my draft board learned that I was on a cattle-boat trip,they tolde me to just keep doing that for my service,'' Luke says.  ''The cattle boat trips were an unbeliavable opportunity for a small-town boy,'' Besides helping people, I had the side benifit of seeing Europe and China.'' but seeing the Acropolis in Greace was very speacial. So was takeing a gondola ride in Vince, Italy a city with streets of water.''  It was also hard work. I had to clean, feed, and care for the anamals. I seved as a night wathman, meaning I had to cheak on all the anamals and report to the captin every hour. One ranny night after my hourly report I slipped on a ladder and fell on my backside. I was fine but couldn't work for a couple of days because of broken ribs. I also had fun too and played vollyball games in empty holdes and more.  
2760	Not only that but it would also let the student perfect their skills and be prepared in class. These projects designated to students will surely boost the alumni's knowledge and confidence on that specific topic. Therefore, the student will not struggle as much as they would have without the extra help. 
2761	This shows on how cool it would be too going into a planet that we havent been to and maybe it can be like ours 
2762	"Lastly,it would give out new oppurtunities to go into other planets, because ""venus is the second planet from the sun"" "
2763	this shows and how dangerous it could be, but if we make it we can see stuff like the sun and notice stuff we cant see thru a camera. also, it would give out more conficence of going into space and going into a diffirent planet.  
2764	I think that participating in the Seagoing Cowboys program is not a good idea and heres why, 
2765	The text explain correcthy each factor that Venus has, it also explain with details what are the dangers that being on Venus presents. 
2766	Venus has value , not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself,but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors.   
2767	"""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"", the author suggetst that studing Venus is worthy but also dangerous. "
2768	"The author tells us how Venus is ""one of the brightest points of light in the night sky"" and also the second largest plantet with the ""nickname misleading since Venus is actually a planet"". "
2769	There so many things to learn about when it comes to different planets. It would be worthy to go study more things about plantets so we can know about them and maybe one day lots of people coud go on one of these plants without just being a scientist. The bad thing about is we still don't have the best ways to get there and back saflty. 
2770	stiving ot meet the challenge presented by Venus has value, not only becasse of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also becasue human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidation endeavors. Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded ot meet the very badges of imaination and innovation. 
2771	The Astronomers think it's a good idea to kepp trying to land on Venus even though their spaceships never last more than a few hours and believe there might be various life forms like Earth and some oceans. 
2772	This are other reason why i dont perfer technology reading people faces 
2773	By weighting the different units,the software can even identify mixed emotions 
2774	The extracurricular activity is effective to students and it will help them pursue in the future. 
2775	thats why students should have an extracurricular activies. 
2776	Also many kids may think that its a bad idea but trying different things in the classroom could help many kids out. And the teachers would love that. But even if its not good the teacher wouldn't have to keep using it. 
2777	Also this would be a good thing becasue kids would learn about art. 
2778	The Mona Lisa is very famous and many people know about it. And learning more about it would be great thing for the kids in the classroom 
2779	I can see why many people wouldn't like it in thier classroom though. Maybe the teacher doesn't like art. Or maybe they don't know that much about art. 
2780	if you really think about it becuase it won't take 30 mins wasting class time on to log in to a computer if you scan your face it would be alot easier to sigh in and get straight to the lesson. 
2781	But how is this face scan going to work in the first place? Well my guess is the camera so then it can stop theif because if someone tried to login without your permission you can see who it was maybe even contact the police. 
2782	I would go for this idea just help everything get easier because who knows maybe this can happen and everyone can get a laptop education would be fun and kids would maybe pay attention more so its taking 2 birds with one stone alos can stop kids from horse playing around keep children on task. Maybe even make the teachers job easier. 
2783	"the author described about the computer system. and the author wrote about Dr. Huang realies on the work of pshychologist, such as Dr. Paul Eckman, creator of FACS (Facial Action Coding System). and Dr. Paul has classified six basic emotions-happiness, suprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness-and then associated each with characteristic movements of the facial muscles. the author wrote the fact of human. ""For istance, you can probably tell how a friend feeling simply by the look on her face"". and Dr. Huang observes that artists such as da Vinci studied human anatomy to thelp them paint facial muscles precisenly enough to convey specific emotions. His new computer software stores similiar anatomical information as electronic code. The Mona Lisa demonstration is really intended to bring a smile to your face, while it shows just how much this computer can do. And the author wrote the definition and some examples of how imagne a computer can describes human feelings. The last thing is the Theory of Emotion, moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions, but also may even help produce them, "
2784	Whoever thought that making faces could reveal so much about the science of emotions! 
2785	Well the bad thing about being over seas. Is that when you or one of your family members go.  There is a 99 percent chance that you or your family memeber will die or get hurt.  Luke also wanted to go seasgoing to show his friend how manly he is. Because his friend thought that hhe was scared to do something that is not normal in his life.  So Luke wen't over sea to show his friend he is not afraid. But when Luke is over seas something bad happens. Luke is feeding the animals, and he trips over something and just about fell over board to his death.  Luckly a peace of medal was sticking out the side of the ship and caught Luke before he almost died. Aways be carful when you on a ship traviling. Something bad aways happens. But anways Luke had a friend come along so they could hang out like most friends do.  Luke and his friend was on the ship, and they stopped at a place where the horses and the animals had to get off. Then the boys had to find something to do so where the horses and the animals stayed is where the two kids started to play games like Baseball, Volleyball, Table-Tennis, Fencing, Boxing, Reading, and Whittling.  So when the two boys were done doing their stuff like playing games they wen't back to their homes, to see their families. But when their time was up off seeing their families they both wen't back to the ship, and said bye to their families for a long time then it was time to go. 
2786	Before cars weren't invented people walked. People are gaining weight of not w 
2787	"In the article""The End Of Car Culture"" Elisabeth Rosenthal says:But America's love affair with its vehicles seems to be cooling. When adjusted for population growth,the number of miles driven in the United States peaked in 2005 and dropped steadily thereafter,according to an analysis by Doug Short of Advisor Perspectives,an ivestment research company. As of April 2013, the number of miles driven per person was nearly 9 percent below the peak and equal to where the country was in January 1995. A study last year found that driving by young people decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009...."" Also in the article:""Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota""the author,Andrew Selsky says:""In a program that's set to spread to other countries,millions of Colombians hiked,biked,skated or took buses to work during a car-free day yesterday,leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams."" "
2788	"Another reason is ""Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication."" "
2789	The main characters were Luke and his friend. Basically the story is about his friend giving him a once in a life time opportunity. He first worked at a grocery store and and the bank. When his friend invited him to go to Europe on a cattle boat. He couldnt say no. So then he went.  He had graduated from high school and had 2 jobs but whem his friend invited him to Europe his whole llife had changed. Since there was a war he went to go help out. He and Don had signed up to be a segoing cowboy. 44 nations joined toggether and formed a UNNRA and he was hired to be a seagoing cowboy. That when you have to take care of horses , mules adnd young cows. That was his job over there in Europe.  He kept going there and he kept helping others. He like his job. The cattle boats were unbelievable for a small town boy it had said. He really enjoyed his job. He toured lots of places like Venice Italy and a city with streets of water. But Luke had made 9 trpis the most of any seagoing cowboy. He traveled across the atlantic ocean and it took him about 2 weeks.  He was taking care of lots of animals and was feeding them 2 or 3 times a day. Bales of hay and bags of oats. They had to be pulled. He had helped out his aunt Katie as a boy. So he was prepared for this. On his second trip he was served as a night watchman. His job was to check the animals every hour. Then one rainy night he had slipped down on a slippery ladder. His heart raced. But luckly he lived. 
2790	His life had changed a whpole lot. Thanks to his friend Don. He liked helping out. He couldnt work though because he had cracked ribs. After that he returned to being a seagoing cowboy. 
2791	the auther is sau that ( In space term- human have seat numerous of spacecraft to land on this clound-draped world. Each pervies mission was unmanned, and for good reason, sice no spacraft survived the landing for more than a few hours. May that is the issue explains why not a single spaceship has touched down on venus in more than three deacades) say the auther in the artivcle. 
2792	The auther also say in the artivcle (that the atmospher of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets venus. Even more challenging are in the clouds of the highly corrosive sulfuric acid in venis atmosphere. He said the on the planet's surface temperatures average over 800 degerees fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 time greater than what we experience on our own planet.) Also the conditions are far more extree than anything humans encounter on the earth; such as environment would crush even a submarine accustomed to diving to the deppest parts of our ocean and would liquefy many metals. Also notable, venus has the hottest surface temperature of any plantes in our solar system even though mercury is closer to ur sun. 
2793	Beyond high pressure and heat, venusian geology and weather present additional impediments like eruping volcanoes powerful earthquakes, and frequent lighting strikes to probes seeking to land on its surface. Astronmers are fascinated by venus because it may well once have been the most earth-like planet in our solar system. Still today venus still has some features that are analogous to those on earth. The planet venus hasa surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains and craters. Furthermore , recall that venus can sometime be our nerest option for a planetary visit, a crucal consideration given the long time frames of space travel. 
2794	and this could mean ruining the techology or worse. 
2795	i agree 
2796	"Cars use a lot of gas and make the world polluted. There are communities that have given up their cars and are sticking to walking and riding bikes. There is a town in Germany called Vauban that make you pay $40,000 with your house if you want to have a parking space. Also in this town there are only two places to park and this means that 70% of the population there down own cars and 57% sold their cars to live there. People in this town say that living there with no cars relieves stress.  In the city of Paris after days of pollution they made a ban on driving to fix the smog.  On mondays motorist that had even number license plates were told not to drive or face a $31 dollar fine. On the next day odd number license plate couldnt drive. 4,000 people were fined and 27 had their cars impounded do to their reaction to the fine. Their were a couple exceptions like plug-in cars, hybrids, also cars carrying more then three people but they make plubic transit free from Monday to Friday.  These acts are happening in countries like Colombia. In Bogota, Colombia they celebrate their third year where cars have been banned with the onmly motor transportation being buses and taxis. They call this day ""The day without cars"" in the capital city which has about 7million poeple. They are doing this to pormote other mean of transportation and violators adn fined $25. A lot of people like to participate in this because it lowers air pollution and stress. Because of this day this city has made 118 miles of bike paths.  In America scientist have found that people 16- to -39 years old are not etting their license. With this drop scientist think that pollution will go down in America. In 2005 the number of miles was at its peak and dropped steadily after that.Â In April of 2013 the number of miles driven per person was 9% below the peak and is even with the the amount in 1995 "
2797	All of these are ways to cut down on not only pollution but also stress.    
2798	i mean what i can say so far about this artical yeah okay i understand where there coming from and all but its just i cant foucus on the part where i have to sit here an explain to yall that the women mona lisa demonstration is really to bring a smile to your face . The process begins whe the computer constructs3-d computers model to the faces . she also was also 83 percent happy 9 percent disgusted 6 percent fealful 2 percent angry . she was peaceful young lady to be honest . But while it shows as much as this computer can . imagine whst a computer that knows when your happy or sad . By the way making a happy face experiments also make you feel slighty happy . According to the feedback theory of emotion, moving your facial muscles not onlt the expresses emotion, btu also mau even help produce them 
2799	i cant just imagine being able to detect exactly how other are feeling even when they are trying to hide their emotions 
2800	also your home pc cant handle the complex algorithms used to decode mona lisa's smile . And meanwhile muscles called orbicularis oculi palpbraeus make crow's -feetaround your eyes . 
2801	"The article states that ""The facial expressions for each emotion are universal,"" observes Dr. Huang, ""even though individuals often show carying degrees of expression"" (Paragraph 4). This is saying that sometimes people don't put much effort into emotions like for instance smiling, sometimes people don't smile as broadly as they would like to. "
2802	Venus has always been the closest planet to Earth other than Mars, but if Venus is so much like Earth astronomers can't figure out why it's so much more inhospitable than Earth.

2808	"Can it actually calculate emtions 99% better then any smart software?  ""The process begins when the computer constrcutios a 3-D computer model of the face, all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles. "
2809	Not everyone would wanna feel like getting on a computer checking to see if there happy or not. 
2810	why neeed to have the Facial Action Coding System when we can just keep finishing what we been doing and reading people minds as usally. 
2811	We are all human but we arent same that is what makes all unique we have different faces for different expression. This technology that is being used is not going to tell you everyone is mad or sad, happy, angry. I dont have the same mad as someone else would so what i make one face and im mad? it could just be my face and the way i look and your gonna tell me that i am mad when you really dont have a clue. We cant tell if someone is mad or sad, depressed or even happy they have those feelings themself and sometimes people dont want others to know if there upset so then your just invading there privacy. That could just make things ten times worse than what it already is. There are things we want people to know and that we dont want people to know and its our decsion on whether we want them to know. 
2812	I find that most effective when reading that you can try some thing when being able to understand different things. 
2813	The author stated that Venus is extremely dangerous do to the crazy temperatures, radioactivity, and absurdly high atmospheric pressures. 
2814	"""On the planetÂs surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet""(The Challenge of Exploring Venus 3). This quote represents everything previously stated. It speaks of the high temperatures and the atmospheric pressure on Venus' surface and atmosphere. ""Also notable, Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system, even though Mercury is closer to our sun""(The Challenge of Exploring Venus).  This quote shows another fact that'll help back up other statements. It talks about how Venus actually has the hottest surface in our solar system.  "

In Paris driving has been ban to clear the air of the global society, motorists were orderd to leave there cars at home or suffered a 31$ fine. Almost 4,000 drivers were fined and people had their cars inpound for their reaction to the fine.  Cars have been banned with only buses, taxis permitteed for the day. the goal was to promote alterenative transportation and reduce smog. Not even the rain has stopped people from participating, ""its a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,' said Carlos Arturo Plaza. a day without cars is an improvement campaign that begaN in Bogota in the lateÂ  mid-1990s.  In the United States, recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by. The question was asked; has America passed peak driving? the United States, with its broad expanses and suburban ideals, had long been one of the world's prime cultures. But Americas love affair with its vehicles seeems to be cooling. When adjusted for popullation growth, the number of miles driven in the united states peaked in 2005 dropped steadily. Americans could not afford new cars, and the unemployment weren't going to work anyway.  There are many car free cities. mostly because of green house gasses or many other cuases. Such as stress' and air pollution cars have been banned to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. There are been efforts in the past two decades to make cities denser and better for walking. "
2817	we would be abel to see how they really feel in that just one picture. we could see how they felt towards someone. 
2818	when they lying too, becuase some students dont like to show or describe how they feel. not just on students we should use it on we should use it on friends and family too. we need to know how to help people if they upstet to cheer them up, or if there happy we need to know what made them happy. 
2819	some students/people dont like to express their emotions becuase they think it lame. especially men becuase they dont want to seem weak 
2820	it also very cool how just a computer can tell you the percentages of how somebody feels 
2821	"I wanted to inform you that there is a limit for driving a car there has been some changes during this few years. Its not only in America that is going on its in other cities and also in states, where people have been droping there adavantages to drive around and dicide to walk instead or to ride a bus to get to other places, they also do that to save money for the gasoline especially if they drive long distance. For example in German Suburb they have forbidden street parking, driveways and home garages, new district on outskirts of freiburg, near the French and Swiss borders. There's a place called Vauban's and its a total Car-free, 70% of vaubans don't own a car and 57% sold thier car to move here. In Paris, they have banded driving due to smog, can ya'll believe that?;they have done because after days of near pollution paris inforced partial driving to clean the air of global city. people that drived with a even-numbered license plate they were charged a 31 dollars fine almost 4,000 drivers were fine according to Reuters. Now the ""smog"" came from Beijing,China which is one of the most polluted city in the world.  Paris typically has more smog then other European capitals, but eventually the smog cleared enough for The Ruling French party. There's was also a Car-Free day in Bogata and it was a big hit, Colombians usually hiked,biked,skated or even took buses to work during the car-free day if you left early people avoid traffic jams. and there goal is to promte alternative transportation and reduce smog it was a good ways to take way stress and lower air pollution. there's parks and sports centers that have bloomed throughout the city; uneven pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad,rush-hours have dramatically cut traffic. The End of Car Culture, where president Obama ambitious goal to curb the United States greenhouse gas emission,unveiled last week. Americans are buying fewer cars and driving less, but also getting fewer licenses as years go by. theres a question that says 'Has America passed peak driving?""i mean am not sure how to explan ,but am sure america ids the the same as it use to be and now that they are talking or writing a articule about it means that alot of people are driving less and buying cars. A study has shown that young people decreased 23% between 2001 and 2009.    "
2822	There are several ways the author suggests studying venus is a worthy pursuit desite dangers along the way. 
2823	The first reason to learn more about Venus is how close it is from the sun. 
2824	Another reason to study Venus is how similar it is to earth. 
2825	"What this story is about is a boy named Luke that helps get animals on and off of the ships that he is one this job is called ""Seagoing Cowboys"". Wha twould you think is hard about this story? not getting sea sick, not falling off the boat, or getting along with the other crew mates? the answer is trying to clean the stalls is my oppinion. All of these things are hard to do, but you can allways go on with life. You try to do the best that you can, but sometimes tou fail ,but you can also succied. His favorite thing to do is to care for animals and he does it in the same way he cares for people. his aunt had a farm and now his childhood farming is starting to pay off the only thing that he never practiced was trying not to get sea sick while he was crossing the Atlantic ocean. He thought that his job was the coolest thing in the world to be doing for his job because he has been doing this since childhood. After all the animals were gone they didn't know what to do. So they played beach games after the stalls were all clean. They played volleyball, baseball, table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and the other fun games that made time fly by like a rocket. "
2826	"In this article i read about ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" was about the creator of the art frew how she normally felt which was not so cheerful but more like what she's a normal act she was as half as happy as she was she always was more in a good mood more than a bad. but as i look at the art created by Leonardo da Vinci's i can tell her mood its like a slightly smile but also a i dont care type of person like she's happy but also she can careless whats going on and how things are around her that slight smile on her face shows that she's not always angry but its more of a smerk like something you do when your kinda naughty about something. She's giving like kinda that evil eye. In this picture it also not just about her and her actions but look around her where shes's at look like a lonely river where its a thoughtful place where she can think and for me what sets ut off is the fact that this coloring donest really have any color as much as its just a copy and the real one got a slight color to it not alot of bright out there type of color its more of a ""ehh"" type like its there but not bright like how they express her feelings shes happy therefor its there but than it dont need to be.

2827	Students know what they struggled with and what they were good at during the school year.  Teachers can not always grasp what a student may need in order to keep improving. In order for students to recieve any sort of benefit from the summer project, is if they make it themselves.  If I was able to make my own summer project with my classmate I would know what needed to be included in order for me to succeed. 
2828	Teachers can overstep because it may not seem like a lot of work to them, but to the students, it is.  They can put in too much information which can make it less benificial to the students. Doing a project over summer break that is not productive, is a huge waste of time. 
2829	Venus is a planet what belong the System Solar. Venus is the second planet from our sun. Earth, Venus and Mars our other planetry neighbor, orbit the sun at different speeds. Venus is sometimes right around the corner-in space term-humans have sent numerous spacecraft to land ono this cloud-draped word.  In the atomosphere of almost 97% carbon dioxide blankets Venus. Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system. Today go to the univerce is very dangers because not can to breathe and you can not survive.  The NASA has one particulary compelling idea for seding humans to study Venus .At thirty-plus miles above the surface, temperatures would still be toasty at around 170 degrees Fahrenheit, but the air pressure would be close to that of sesa level on Earth.  NOt can have table or cell phone is a acid or heat capable of melting tin.  The people are very corious what investigator everything the System Solar. 
2830	"We would want to make changes as, ""like to be a better person for a better tomorrow"" This supports the idea of having have many good thoughts and incasing your work as much as possible. "

2832	"I have a ""C"" in math, and swim is coming up-you're just going to take away my chances to beat my times from last year? "
2833	So that's why i think its important school before sports. and have an A or B for grades so you can do sports 
2834	Our school should have a community center. 
2835	why is community important for students to know 
2836	tudents will receive a good grade if they participate in this community because is like an extra credit. 
2837	due to that their friends would want to enjoy the program because their friend told them about it. 
2838	but you can always change it if it gets out of hand. 
2839	It's also not just what's completely wrong with the electoral college but how does it help in the first place? 
2840	When you start analizing it, it really doens't help much. How much actual help can the lectora coellge make, in my defense not much. Why? Simple, its just 20-30 more votes and not many states have that much Hawaii has uop to 4 electoral votes, not much. 
2841	Some of the students believe that it should not be available at al 
2842	but i personally believe that it should be for those who want to 
2843	It does take a long time out of the day but also it helps the community all together because that's what it is. 
2844	That we have to do is get a B in sport or other activities 
2845	because all the student get a C for doing in sport for that because that not doing something or not doing the sport or other activities that why u get a C in sport or other activities that if u get B that mean you was doing something sport and other activities that you spouse to thing with sport and other activities. and i think that if u no t wherein the outfit of sport u need to play in sport for that and that what if u get a B for doing something that is good and some other activities but if u get a C that you not wherein the outfits or other activities that need to do in there for to get good grade of B and C. B is good and C it ok it kind good in for sport and other activities what u did in there for something .And it fun to be in sport and other activities and having fun with your family and friends that what u did at home then when the principal come to your class what u have P.E they come and see what u doing in class like doing sport and other activities so u can get  B in that class room or they see u doing sport or other activities they might come in take a picture of u doing sport and other activities so u can get a B in that class if u did not do noting in that class room or u kind of did something u will get C for that and some other thing for sport there is a lot of sport and activities that u can do for that and let the activities that what the principal know about the sport and other activities so that ever thing make the policy change for the school so students can do some sports and activities for work and fun to be there that what the principal want so student to join there self for that there a lot of a sport and activities fun for them to have much fun doing a lot of sport and activities.     
2846	We already have too many problems involving cars that we don't need to add any more. The people who are involved in creating the driverless cars should focus on making sure that the railroads are safe before trying to come up with anything new. I think that creating theese new cars is already to much work. It would involve creating the sensors, changing the breaks, and making new computer hardware and software. Theese things will not protect us from getting into accidents or having cars crashes which should be our main focus. 
2847	Now think about this if we were to go with this changing thing look at how many people would lose thier job. 
2848	"After the Presidential election,your governer prepares a ""Certificate of Ascertainment"" listing all of the candidates who ran for President in your state along with the names of their respected electors. the Certificate shows that the winning Presidential candidate in your state and shows which will represent your state at the meeting of the electors in december of the election year. "
2849	"They think that under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president , but for a slate of electors , who in turn elect the president. For instance, if you lived in Texas and wanted to vote for whoever, you'd vote for a slate of 34 democratic electors pledged to that person. At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair. Because of the winner-takes-all system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the ""swing"" states. "
2850	The Electoral College is widely regarded as anachronism,a non-democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be[overuled] by declaring the candidate who receives the most popular votes the winner. But each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the part's nominee; however, it is entirely possible that the winner of the electoral vote will not win the national popular vote. There are five reasons for retaining the Electoral College despite its lack of democratic pedigree; all are practical reasons, not liberal or conservaative reasons 1) Certainty of Outcome 2) Everyone's President 3) Swing States 4) Big States and 5)Avoid Run-Off Election. Â        Â Â     
2851	Well, me personally, i dont think its a good idea for a senator to change to that. I feel ike everyone should remain voting as usaul. 
2852	If not this wouldnt feel like america anymore; 
2853	America is all about freedom and the power of free speech....etc. This is what makes this country great; no dictator telling us what to do everyday. Without the power of voting this country would not feel the same. It wouldnt feel like america anymore.  
2854	Also, althoughs theres a lot of cons to this, 
2855	really its just more worth it. 
2856	It makes people feel impowered. Knowning that they're making an imoportant decision in life. It makes people feel free and glad that they live in america. Where you have a choice that yours and freedom at the palm of your hands. 
2857	Plus, sometimes people have more different opinions than others on voting

2865	There is no need for this great mess. 
2866	I no longer want to vote for a slate of representitives when it comes time to vote for another president. 
2867	If i was the principle I certainty wouldn't do that to a bunch of children that their passion was that high for sports. What about fat kids who don't get outside and only do when their at school do you won't to take away something that precious away from someone. The only thing that keeps them from getting fat all over again. 
2868	Is there really a new kind of life on mars. No! We are the only life in this universe. Plus if people lived on mars, how could they build such a huge amount of rock into a face so perfectly. 
2869	I thnk this because they wouldnt be driving the car the car would be driving itself and that would make people pay less attention. But dont get me wrong it would be a nice and amazing idea if we could all be responsible enough and pay attention so that we dont cause accidents. These cars would also help us from accidents because it would be smart enough to know when there is a stop sign or anything like that. 
2870	Im sure that the cars saftey system as in air bags and other things would become one of the prime resources if it did mal-function. I feel as if more people would trust this car if there was a percent or something on how efficent this car would be. 
2871	i mean lets be serious no one wants to spend alot of money on a car that isnt worth it. I think if the car was a little cheaper and was alot more reliable on being able to pull over and stop without human work. 
2872	"In 2013, BMW announces the development of the ""Traffic Jam Assistant"". Been able to be comfortable and easier to drive but the driver has to be careful while driving. Be aware of everything that is going on the road; and we're the one who takes care of the car and not the car protecting us or feel more safer. I honestly think that we're the thinking more of the fashion or the style of the cars, and become more less careful on the protection of our own. We have to think more of the protection and make cars more safer to feel and comfortable. The driver is not going to feel safer, but it's also going to convince the driver to drive more safer. According to ""driverless cars are coming' people are going to focus on laws that is going to keep drivers,passengers,and pedestrians safe. "
2873	More cars are going to make and more style are going to make; but I also want to be safe when I'm in a car.

2875	"The Electoral College has been around for a long time. The Electoral College is a process which consists of the counting of the electoral votes by Congress, meetings of the electors where they vote for President and Vice President, and the selection of electors. It consists of a total of five hundred and eight electors and a majority of two hundred and seventy votes are required for presidency. Electors are choosen by the candidates political party. When voting for presidential elections, you are also voting for your candidates electors too.  When the presidential elections are complete the govenor prepares a ""Certificate of Ascertainment"" which lists all the candidates who ran for President and the names of all the electors and it also tells who won the presidency and the electors that will represent your state. The state conventions, state partys central comitee, and the presidential candidates, all pick the electors. "
2876	The electoral college requires a presidential candidate to be choosen. 
2877	It can be argued that the electoral college methods of choosing electors is bad 
2878	Obama is the president of the United States. Romney is a republican that went against Obama in the presidential election of 2012. Obama had a plurality against Romney, meaning he recieved more votes than Romney but did not recieve a clear majority of votes. 
2879	Yes richard nixon, jimmy carter, bob dole, the u. s chamber of commerce, and the AFL-CIO agreed on electoral college but electoral college is when the voters vote for the state electors who the vote for president. there is an arguement called the disaster factor also and thats the single best argument against the electoral college. Thats why popular vote for president is better than electoral because there is a better possibility of the majority of people winning. 
2880	The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational it officail !!!. Also arguments against direct elections are apurious at best. Bob dole was right:abolish the electoral college.

Under the 23rd amendment of the constitution, the District of columbia is theated like a state for purposes of the Electoral collage.  The electoral collage consists of 538 electors. A majority of 270 electorsvotes is required to elect the President. Most states have a ""winner-take -all"" system that awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate. So another words whoever gets the most votes wins but the odds are which ever side has the larger amount of people voting republican or democrat is normaly who wins. because if your a republican your most likly to vote democrat.  "
2890	Everything that is rong with the electoral collage 
2891	Under the electoral collage system, voters vote not for the president but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president. If you lived in texas, for instance, and wanted to vote for Kerry, you'd vote for slate of 34 democratic electors pledged to kerry

2901	That was eighteen years ago when the Vikings missions ended. Jim Garvin also said they took a picture of it when they first heard about the faces arriving on Mars. The NASA program felt it was very important that they get a good picture of the faces on Mars. 
2902	The tem relalized that there were no aliens after all. 
2903	Even though the team had got the picture everyone was no so happy still. The camera that they had on board had peer wispy clouds. The aliens was hidding by the haze when the team had taken the ten pictures. Image 3 was way bigger then the pixel size they thought it would be 
2904	The lava dome takes a form of an isolated mesa which means its the same height as the Face on Mars. 
2905	1.) What is the Electoral College' A electoral college is a process, not a place. 
2906	I didn't know they had 538 electors. majority of 270 electoral votes. Representatives plus two for your Senators. . . . The Congressional delegation one of each memeber in the house. But i do think the District of Columbia. is each candidate running for President in your state has his or her own group of electors. Chosen a party political party, responsibilities. but what will happen if something happens to the congress what will go wrong? for the stuff that they be having partys for the policital paartys & stuff what do they do that for the things they have. like will the president be alright with this stuff that be going on 
2907	these things is good 
2908	cause we will like the same things but idk know it that was alot of 538 electors but some of it will work 
2909	I understand what the American people is doing its a factor that some of yall got to learn thoe 
2910	Yes that's right they do have to make it to the candidate first they just can't walk up there first you got to be president by the pesident frist if you not by him or here then you messe dup for goood 
2911	its not working out like that at all. it's official: the electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. The best arguments in favor of it all mostly assertions in without much basis in reality. And the arguments against direct elections are spurious at best. It's hard to say this, but Bob Dole was right: Abolish the electoral college! 
2912	3.) In 2012 election, for example, Obamma received 61.4 percent of the electoral vote compared to only 51.3 percent of the popular votes cast for him and romney. . . . BEcause almkost all states award electoral votes on a winner -take-all basis, even a very slight plurality in astate creates a landslide electoral -vote victory in that state. A tie in the nationwide electoral vote is possible because the total number of votes 538 is an even number, but it is highly unlikely. . . . The residents of each other regions are likely to be a successful presidents. The residents of other regions are likely to be feel disenfranchised- to feel that their votes do not count, that the new president will have no regard. Swing States' [2012's] election- to focus their campaign efforts on the toss-up states. . . . Big Staes' The popular vote was very close in Florida [in 2012]; nevertheless Obama, who won that vote got 29 electoral votes. A victory by the same margin in Wyoming would net the winner only 3 electoral votes. So, other things being equal, a large state gets more attention from presidentail candidates in a campaign than a small state does. . . . Avoid Run-Off Elections' Nixon in 1968 and Clintion in 1992 both had only a 43 percent plurality of the popular votes , while winning a majority in the Electoral College (301 and 370 electoral votes, respectively) 
2913	It can be argued that the electoral College method of selecting the president amy turn of potentail 
2914	that is right because sometimes you really don't have that much of that stuff like that now but sometimes its hard to see stuff like that but you got to work on some things like that but not everything likec come on now. so candidates who do that some want. . . . 
2915	"In  Source 3: In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the president  ; they give us ""  five reasons for retaining the Electoral College  "" ( Richard A. Posner ). The first reason is ""  Certainty of Outcome  "" which goes on to say that; ""  ... almost all states award electoral votes on a winner-take-all basis, even a very slight plurality in a state makes a landslide electoral-vote victory in that state.  "", ( Richard A. Posner ). The second reason is ""  Everyone's President  "" that states that; ""  The Electoral College requires a presidential canidate to have trans-regional appeal.  "", ( Richard A. Posner ). ""  Swing States  "" is the third reason, talks about Toss-up States. The fourth reason is ""  Big States  "" which sates ""  that the Electoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance...  "" ( Richard A. Posner ). The fifth and final reason is ""  Avoid Run-Off Elections  "", it says that ""  ... no canidate receives a majority of the votes cast.  "" ( Richard A. Posner ) "
2916	because if it was turned into a popular vote election people who voted for a specific president wouldn't have won just because they aren't popular amongst the people that are voters iin that year's election 
2917	This image we see has beeing used and talked about in many places such as Hollywood films, books, magazines, radio stations, talk shows, and grocery stores. 
2918	but it is not. 
2919	But there are many reasons why it's not. 
2920	If we were to use the popular vote system, people could vote for candidates who run for fun, or joke. Or if a candidate decides to pursuade an overwhelming amount of people with a certain point, people will surely vote on that candidate, even if the point is invalid. 
2921	This can bring the expectations for the president lower,    
2922	Also it is unfair to the people who want to be presidents because they mostly have a tie on the electoral votes and are elected on who wins the popular vote. 
2923	nonetheless a single voter`s vote. 
2924	I think that the school should participate in sports 
2925	its not because of our grades that makes you so upset its because of our attitudes and how we act around teachers and staff specially officer baker i mean the man has been though to much already 
2926	the way i see it we need to have something to do with our lives and how we spend it on campus even off campus we have to behave when we are around teachers. plus i think those 4 letter words every day is driving the students crazy, I'm sorry but I'm telling the truth. But if you don't want to hear it then that's ok with me and that walking on the green going to connections please give us a break that's why boys cut up all the time because you always say walk on the green it is making us cut up like that since Elementary school we didn't have to walk on the green but now we are in middle school we have to walk on the green, i mean come on TEACHER_NAME can you just at least give this school a break and don't you get me started on boys not pulling up there pants, as RELATIVE_NAME says on RELATIVE_NAME's big happy family pants on the ground got your pants on the ground looking like a fool with your pants on the ground can't turn around with the gold in your mouth RELATIVE_NAME remix what. But she is right boys do look like fools with there pants on the ground, they got that style from jail they need to leave that style where its at and start handling there business and have s future from STUDENT_NAME 
2927	EX: boys play with girls or girls play with boys. 
2928	Really I think that lunch should be extended to an hour because teens like to socialize and were not getting enough time to our self because this is ridiculous 
2929	30 minutes to our self we barely have enough time to eat its insane that we really have no social time.  But yet teachers wonder why we are so talkative in class this is my conclusion to this solution to the talking in class solution to the texting in class solution. 
2930	I dont like how the electoral is set up 
2931	"for instince like it says What is Electoral College? section 10, ""If you lived in Texas and wanted to vote for Jonh Kerry, you'd vote for a slate of 34 democratic electors pledged to Kerry."" then he would get 34 electoral vote. "
2932	That's why it isnt a good idea to be making driverless cars. 
2933	I feel like driveless cars are a bad idea and a good idea. The reason i say this is because it can have a good outcome to it and a bad out come. There can be probles and it can solve some solutions. 
2934	1 major reason is to let the election have a fair fight. 
2935	Another important reason is that with out the electoral there would only be 1 side of a vote for ex it just be the congress voting 
2936	With the electoral the want it to be equal so nobody goes home felling down cause he didnt have a fair ruling or a fair election 
2937	For my 3 reason they help select how many elector on how many state could have witch for ex the 23 amendment of the constitution they allowed columbia to have 3 
2938	I dont now much but that sound like alot. 
2939	4 reason is that each state has his or her on elector. 
2940	If u havent notice i have said yes they should be hear to do there job as a elector and to do there job as a guy/girl to do there jobs rights. I understand why elector are trying to stay there trying to stay to have a sucessful carrer and do good in life and not be a bum that live on the street or working at mcdonalds. Another good reason is that if it turn into a tie then the house or representatives come into place and they put the thoughts into. A reason to be it unfair the electoral collehe get no credit for what happens they should get alittle for all the hard work they put into. Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for president, but for a slate of electors, who turn elect the president. Who are the elector? They can be anyone not holding public office.       Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â     
2941	why would you want to require them to participate in community service when all its going to do is make their lives even more hectic. 
2942	why make them do something that they wont even enjoy . I f the students don't enjoy what their doing then they wont understand the lesson that they are suppose to learn from the experience. 
2943	The Electoral College only consists of qualified citizens it elect the President, so even when you vote the majority doesn't even matter because the President is only elected by those qualified citizens. 
2944	Maybe they were tryin to send a sign, if they were trying to send a sign why couldn't they have just come to earth and tell us what we need to know. What was the point of going to Mars no one lives on Mars we live on Earth. 
2945	"But the scientist wasn't really focused on this ""face"" they just happened to look over an see it otherwise just like if it was your imagination you would be very focused on to something and happen to see it. "
2946	These are some of my ideas and opinions about community service being good for us. 
2947	or you can text but you can never have it out in class or the teacher can take it and keep it until a parent comes and pick it up and they have to sign a paper to get the phone. I agree that we should only let them take the phone if there using it in class but like when we are switching to are class we can talk or text for a min but when class starts then no cell phones. But are school we cant have are phones out until the end of the day and we have to wait until we get outside its like unfair. 
2948	if they tye what do you do now? Should we flip a coin to see who wins possibly one of the most important descisons 
2949	but that is an opion.Â  Their are meany rational reasons about why the Electoral College is benificaial rather then destructive. 
2950	but this may actually determine the election.Â  
2951	If those other party people dont vote who knows mabey if they had voted their party might have been luckly.Â  Statistics prove that when certaint parties win contriversial states thats because some people from 1 party didnt vote. 
2952	No voting especailly in swing states can make your party, or your wanted candiadate loose the election.Â  Every year some of the swing states change so everyone should vote especially those in the swing states to insure your party or your candidate win. 
2953	In the big states the Electoral College it restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment of the Senate decreed in the Constitution 
2954	Other things being equal, a large state gets more attention from presidential candidates in a campain than a small one does.. Every state should have the same amount of attention, not be treated differently.    
2955	"The electoral college is a process that consists of electors the majority of the electal votes is required to elec the president, each candidaate running for President in your state has his or her own group of electors, for this reason in the following discussion, the word ""state"" also refers to the District of Columbai.  "
2956	I would know if it was real or not if only i had seen it with my own eyes but, im against the fact that they're saying that it's a real face made by the aliens because nobody would really think that there are aliens living in space. 
2957	"I also would know that it's not a face of the pharoah because the text says that it's a ""huge rock formation"". "
2958	Nobody would really think that aliens created a face that big, even if there were aliens living in space i would not think that those type of creatures have any clue of how to build big structure like that. Only if i were out there in space looking at the face then i would know my self that it's real or not. A humans eye could tell if anything is real or not. If the world had something to prove that it's not a face then i would be with them and i would agree to everything they say about it, cause the person who thought that it was a face built by the aliens then i bet the majority of the peoples would disagree 
2959	inconclution students have benefit from being able to attend classes from home.Â  
2960	Those are the reasons that students shoulent have good grades 
2961	We as kids should learn more about service, 
2962	such as the unfairness to voters, the disasters awaiting to happen with the Electoral College. The only downside to this is that it will take a little longer to count the votes and finalize the election, but it is worth it. All voters would be at peace of mind knowing that their vote actually counted for something. 
2963	I hope i have made my point across about the Electoral college system. 
2964	"The Electoral college is a way of voting for Presidency. Electors are the people who consist of that. Their are 538 electors. A majority of the 270 votes is required to elect a president, The 23rd amendment of the constitution states that 3 electors and treated like a state for purposes of the electoral college. The candidate's political party generally choose the electors. The Presidential election is held every 4 years on the tuesdaay after the first monday in november. Most of the states have a winner takes all system except Nebraska and maine. After the presidental election, the governer prepares a ""Certificate of Ascertainment"".  "
2965	The Electoral colloge is a process that is full wit pros and it also has its small and enormous cons.       Â        
2966	"The electoral college has existed since the founding fathers established it in the consistution as a way to elect a presedential canidate. What the electoral college is, it is a ""compromise between election of the president by a popular vote of qualified citizens."" What the electoral college does instead of electing a preseident through a popular vote, it is electing through a electoral vote, that means if you are voting your votes are actually counted towards the electors of the canidates. Each candiate has it's own slate of electors, in wich you are voting for them, and they will make the decision of deciding who is president of the U.S.  A presidential canidate can have more popular votes then the other candiate, meaning votes favored by the people, but if a president has more electoral votes, which is votes by the electors then they are elected as the president. "
2967	That means such as president Romney can have a strong appeal in the south, but he will gain no electoral vote. 
2968	The popular vote was very close in Florida nevertheless Obama, who won that vote, got 29 electoral votes. So other things equal, a large satae gets more attention than a small state does 
2969	As for the popular vote it would be much easier to vote only by the people. 
2970	Electoral college is fair to the eye of an elector. Is it though favored by the people knowing that their popular vote is pointless of a final president? 
2971	its fair if we get to choose our president and he or she wins then he or she should be president. 
2972	Some people should consider themselves lucky because of what happened in 2000 with that fiasco and it was the biggest election crisis in a century. Even though there is 270 votes required to vote for the president, whats fun about that is because there be moreÂ  votes and atleast people participate in them. Choosing our president is best because when your voting for the president your voting for state electors 
2973	it gives chances for people that want to be president or senator. 
2974	It also gives them a chance to show and see who would do more for our country,like for example when they do their campaign commercials and what i look at is who does the best. 
2975	A grade C average is low for participating in sports. 
2976	Many principal many get many complaints about their students having their phones in school I believe they cant do any thing about it, if one of their students phone goes off they shouldn't be able to take it but if it was out in plain view then they can take it but i think at the end of that class period they should be able to get it back but the teacher have to turn it off and let them know they cant turn it back on till the end of the day when they go home. 
2977	At least ever body is not doing with there class work. 
2978	f you do use the things that i have mentioned, i would like to receive full credit for the inspiration of my ideas. Because i believe in giving credit, where credit is due. 
2979	Everyone should read some sourses before making an disision like this. Not just the people voting so that even the people not voting will fully understand why one disision is being made and whyone isnt being made. This one thing can affect the way electing president will be from now on to the future, unless they deside they want to change it again. 
2980	I also think that the craminals will have something to do. even they will be picking up garbith they will be happy to be out of jeil. 
2981	TO volatier they have to wear old cloths. they have a seartan time for them to be done. if they are bord at home they can ask the people to do more work with the community service. the people will tell them what ever they want. then the volienters will go home or stay there ware they are at. 
2982	That is an issue but also some people voting don't really understand what the two people are offering and just vote because one sounds better, looks cooler, your friends are voting for him/her. This is why the popular voting system cannot be fully trusted.  
2983	If you want to have some fun you got to think hard that even though you still got good grades that doesn't mean that you still not going to treat others the way you suppose to . And we still need to have a good grades in conduct. My opinion about this article is that all the students that have a C average can do better you just got to try, and listen to your teacher do as they say. 
2984	students don't waste your time take your education seriously, without education you're nothing but only a person, 
2985	The electoral College will help with votes because the people that don't vote the person that gets the electoral votes still get the same amount of votes even if some people didn't vote at all it won't change. 
2986	But if it was by popular vote then the people that don't vote will make a big impact because you will need more votes to win the election. 
2987	I doubt anyone can live in a world like that. There probably wont be no sports, no shopping for good clothes and even some death , instead there will be flatten basketballs and footballs because since no one helped the earth all of our resources would be gone and your parents will lose their jobs so the president can try to make the world good again , raise taxes so less stuff for us kids. If you go to the store there wont be awesome clothes like polo instead there will be some horrible stuff like messed up clothes that hobos be wearing, and i know for a fact no kid want to be wearing them definitely if your a fashion diva. See a world like this isn't the world us kids want. 
2988	Overall i think doing community service might be a drag, but its the right thing and you help one or even more lives. 
2989	but I could be troubling for some people. There has to be a lot of thought put into making this decision, from the person making the decision and their point of view on it to the people that are going to be affected once the decision is made. All this will have to be thought out taking into consideration the type of community service that is going to be required to do . 
2990	The Electoral College was a good idea that we had been using. It consists of 538 electors but 270 electoral votes are required to elect the president. 
2991	Less electors need to needed and more of the population vote needs to be added in to the final election. 
2992	First,  The Electoral College consists of 538 electors. A majority of 270 electors votes is required to elect the President. Your state's entitled allotmentof electors equals the numbers of members in it's Congressional delegation:one for each member in the House of Representatives plus two for you Senators. 
2993	Inconclusion,Anybody should be able to vote like teenagers,and aldults because the Electoral College is a process,they consists of the selection of the electors,and at the most basic level,the electoral college is unfair to voters.    
2994	it really does not change anything except for the fact that it would keep most of us quiet. 
2995	The Electoral College consists of 538 electors 
2996	The Electoral College process consists of selection of the electors 
2997	each canidate running for president in your state has his or her own group of electors .  
2998	To begin with , i think the state senator should keep the Electoral College because it a fantastic college . 
2999	Majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the President .The District of Columbia Is Allocated 3 electors and treated like a state for purposes of the Electoral College. The Electoral College is a process , not a place. The Electoral College is widely regared as an anachronism, a non-democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be overruled by declaring the candidate who recieves the most popular votes the winter . 
3000	The Electoral College process consists of selection of the electors , the meeting of the electors where they vote for presisdent and Vice president , and the counting of the electoral votes by congress . 
3001	The presidential election is held every four years on the Tuesday after the first Monday In November. Most states have a winner-take-all system that awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate. The Certificate of Ascertainment also declares the winning presidential candidate in your state and shows which electors will represent your state at the meeting of the electors in December of the election year . 
3002	Last but not least , Let me remind you that each candidate running for president in you state has his or her own group of electors 
3003	There Usually selected by the candidates political party , but state laws vary on how the electors are selected and what their responsibilities are. Your states certificates of Ascertainments are sent tot he Congress and the National Archives as part of the offcial records of the presidential election . After the presidential election , your governor prepares a ' Certificate of Ascertainment' listing all of the candidates who ranfor president in your state along with the names of their respectiveÂ  electors . 
3004	Most students have a C GPA lower of higher. My opinion on this idea is good and bad. 
3005	Mars really isn't that safe, that may be why people dont life on Mars without a suit and oxygen tank. Because something bad could really happen up there, and we need contact with earth to tell whats going on. 
3006	"That may put people in danger sending the crew up there. We can only think and hope that the artifact was created by aliens. The face on Mars is an icon for magazines and movies like ""The Martian"" and books like ""The Lunar Chronicles"". A single dicovered thing can turn sellers into money-makers easliy. All these fanatsy in books and movies, really can make us believe what we believe. "
3007	"Third, The Electoral College has each canididate running for president in your stare has his or her own group of electors"" said In Defense of the Electoral College: Five Reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the president. "
3008	like fights and other things that not really cost for during the school hours people need to learn how to control there self, at school with people in the public it is crazy in this world now in days back then it seems that it was probably no burglary or nothing like that. But now it is crazy in the streets of certain places. 
3009	first of all,even though the electoral collage consists of 538 electors 
3010	i think it would be better if all of citizens from across the globe can help more 
3011	due to more people and more relibilty then with 570 people. 
3012	"secend of all,if ""the popular vote""was gone and was taken seriesly then we would have better quality presidents "
3013	like al gore even though he was popular he still lost the presidency. according to bradford plumer over 60 precent of voters would perfer a direct election also,how are we sure to trust the electors anyway? is texians vote on john kerry they might not lisin and vote on whoever they want out of spite 
3014	"and they occasionally refuse to vote for the party canidate. and disaster will happen is two slates of electors to congress like when it happend in hawaii in 1960 when richard nixion only wanted elector voters but luckly he did it ""without establishing a precedent"". and what would happen if theirs a tie in the electoral vote? then the electorals would be thrown to the house of represenitives and they vote on the president there. "
3015	meaning someone that just like you from your race or skin color,but at the same time the Electoral College is established cause of our founding fathers as a compromise between election of the president by a vote in Congress and election of the president by a popular vote. A Electoral College is consist of 538 electors and 270 electoral votes are required to elect the President,we on the other hand,get a few people that we voted on for voting for the president and vice president,and sometimes that can be the wrong president we pick or get confused picking the wrong candidates. But I feel the people who support who we have as Presidents should be abled to have a say on what they think and feel on the President,cause after all,we need someone to look up to. 
3016	Also the negatives of the electoral college are not really a big deal that coud cause a fixing or a inbalenced vote towards one side over another 
3017	its not that big of a deal unless the people you have counting votes cannot count over 538, then ok those are some pretty stupid people you should send them back to school. My grandpa at age 70 can count much better than that. 
3018	"I can see how it can be somewhat balenced already; stated in the first source ""the whole electorial college has a total of 538 electors. The president you wish to elect has to have a majority of 270 electorial votes in order to win."" That means they need to have 270 more votes than the other president too. "
3019	Of course some students wouldn't like that, 
3020	I being a helpful person to the community and others who needs the help feel that community service is a pay-off to knowing your helpful. 
3021	because they will be intertain. 
3022	And they are just talking and talking. 
3023	In reality we all want our way, or our voice and or actions to make an impact, with the Electoral College that's not happening, which is making the people of our country unhapy with the government, which means we all can't get along 
3024	"In the article it says that The ""Face on Mars"" has become a pop icon. The face icon statted in a hollywood film appeared in books, magazines, radio talk shows even haunted grocery store checkout lines for 25 years! Most people belive that face was an alien artifact, photographing cydonia became a priority for NASA when mars global surveyor (MGS)arrived in red planet sept. 1997. "
3025	Since the voter are not voting directly for their candidate of choise, I personaly dont think this is the best way to go. The popula elections provide a better way of voting for president. Since it means that the people that vote a voating directly to the candidarte and not the electors. 
3026	The main reason for this is so that we dont leave our electing in the hands of foriegn people/immiagrants. The is what the president needs to get elected in the electoral college. 
3027	One president could be the favorite among the voters but the electors the president has to back him up with electoral votes could maybe not be as big as another presidents electors and its pretty much, in many peoples eyes, giving the least popular among the people president an easier way to become president. 
3028	In this essay I am going to talk about NASA discussing the Face with, someone who thinks it was created by aliens and I am suppose to convince that is wasn't a alien who, made the Face. 
3029	The other thing is you have to be an qualified citizen. 
3030	Sorry but i dont want a comenest to vote for our president.  
3031	So your getting back some of what you put in, it is a win win situation 
3032	If we get rid of the Electoral College then the voting for office wouldnt be fair. Some states are a lot bigger than others. So once its gone then the bigger states would have more effect on the votes than the smaller ones 
3033	Although in 2000 the Electoral College vote happened 
3034	This was seen in 2012's election. The ost thoughtful voteers would have to decide the election, making Electoral College very fair.    
3035	"Voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference rather than poeple who thing that single vote may decide an election"" (Posner, Paragraph 23). "
3036	The people of the U.S deserve to make great decisions like these, on account of the fact that us, the people, make most of what we have in America today, and though we work hard and may have fights sometimes, we still make choices together,voting being one of them, and this unifies us even more. 
3037	Allowing this will bring a sense of unification  
3038	. We already consider doing selfless acts just to make peace. Example: Our taxes pay doctors', polices', etc. salaries. We at least deserve to decide who enforces laws. 
3039	To commence the third reasoning let another question be asked: First, say for example that you work a double-shift, full-time, day and night just to keep food on your childrens' and wifes' plate, clothes on their backs, and a roof over their heads. When the bills roll in, your paycheck isn't won't arrive for weeks and you still haven't enough to pay, so you may have to work overtime if possible or pick up another job. No one gets rich off the government clearly, and yet we work so hard to just make it. Now here's the question: Doesn't it all feel worth it when the paycheck come in? Okay now for the deeper question: What is the sense or feeling you specifically get when you see you happy families' faces? Now for the point: Our work pays off. We work for the government (at least most of us does) together, whether to put bread on the table or otherwise. Now wouldnt it give us that sense of freedom that us hard workers get to make great decisions like these? It would. 
3040	All of these things bring us together more than we might even think, whether its families, friends, or just us as a nation. 
3041	"Two guys named Rich, Jummy carter, Chamber of Commerce and AFL-CIO and they are not alone according to Gallup poll in 2000, after Al Gore won the popular vote but lost the presidency, over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now. Under the electoral college system voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors. The single best argument agianst the electoral college is what we might call the disaster factor. The election would be thrown to the house or Representatives, where state delegations vote to the presdient. Because each state casts only one vote to give th voters vote to the president and another for the congress,  The House's selection can hardly be expected to reflect the wall of the people, And if an electoral tie seems unlikely. A the base level the electoral colloege is unfair to voters. Because of the winner takes it all system in each state , candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chances at win at these king of states for the president. They focuse only on the the tight races in the ""swing"" states. There many things in the Electoral College that many people on they outside don't know what the Congress or the up running presidents are struggling it looks easy on the inside bu on the ouside wow they have a lot to work on.    "
3042	voting is held every tuesday of November. The elector college consist of 538 electors. A majority of 270 elector vots is required to elect from the president. Your states entitled allotment of electors equals the number of members in its congressianl delegaton oe for each member in the house of Respresentives plus two for your Senators. The electoral Collge pricees consiste of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for president and vice president and the counting of the electoral votes by congress. 
3043	Futhermore, most states have a winner take it all system that awards all electort to the wiining the election. your states certification ascertainment also delclares the winning presidincial in your states adn shows which electors will respensint your state at the metting of the election in december. 
3044	The american people should conside themselves lucky that the 200 fiasco was the biggest election cris in the sententuries . Back in 1960, segregations in the Lousiana Legistature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors. 
3045	Finally, Â its offical the elecoral college is unfair outdated adnd irrtional the agurements are against judgement. they need to keep electorial college. There are five ereaosn for retainign the electoral college desoite the lack of democratic pedigree, certanty of outcome, everyones presindent ], swing states, big states, avoid run off elections. 
3046	To begin with, I think this world is here to be on and do anything we want too.  But I think that our community is important to us because its a place to have fun with friends and family.  But its full of different kinds of both good and bad stuffs.

3050	"The Electoral College is a great process that was created by the founding fathers in the Constitution.""The founding fathers established it in the Constitution as a compronise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens."" The electoral college consistw of the electors the meeting of the electors of the voting for president and vice president. The electoral college process consists of 538 electors. When you run for president you have to get majority of the 270 electoral votes its required. Every candidate running for president has there own group of electors.""Each candidate running for president in your state has his or her own group of electors."" The electors are chosen by the candidate's political party.  When the presidential election is over your governor prepares a certificate of ascertainmentits listing all of the candidates who had ran for president in your state. The certicate also says the winning presidential canddidate in your state.""After the presidential election,your governor prepares a ""certificate of ascertainment"" listing all of the candidates who ran for president in your state along with the names of their respective electors.""The states certificates of ascertainments are sent to the congress and the national archives. "
3051	its a very important process of how we choose the president. If we just put our say in the votes some people might feellike htey amde the wrong choose in the voting 
3052	"Most people usually chose for themselves because they have the right. Everybody should have a say not just  ""the qualified citizens""  writen in source one. "
3053	Secondly, yes people make bad and somtimes terribles mistakes but thats what we do. 
3054	People may argue by saying so if it is something simular to earth then that means martians were here to and then they got bord of the place they so they left and went somewhere else. then they built this big face of maybe a king or emporer or something and they are hiding from us 
3055	Driveless cars are coming. Whether you will buy or support this new idea or not is your choice. 
3056	I consider important the study, since, is all the necessary for comply the desire purpose. That why exist a lot of manner for having the complete study online, or in the school. 
3057	In the old year's people do not having help for study and make future plan. The new youth have a big opportunity for make future plan at this time. 
3058	There are all sorts of things to do from spending time with the young and elderly to cleaning the city. 
3059	Some students think that doing stuff like that is boring because their not getting paid.

3064	More people will be satisfied, and less complaints and assinations. Think about it. The popular vote is the way to go. When your doing a science experiment they say to take as many trials as you possibly can because the experimentation results will be much more accurate. Well why wouldn't you do that for something that is going to affect the  ENTIRE  United States of America. 
3065	I just hope you listen to me TEACHER_NAME  it will make all the students happy. 
3066	I think student should be able to help do community service 
3067	So don't waste time playing and goofing around when somebody is in need, go a head an help them out am sure they will feel thankful that you have done something. 
3068	On the other hand people believe that the electoral college is good and we should keep having it. They believe this because because they think that they know what is best for us. Also that their vote is the best option than ours. 
3069	the presidental election is to find a new leader of the united states he basicly has to pass laws and do taxes we vote to make sure we get the right president we dont want someone thats gonna make silly laws and taxes the people to much the president has to take charge has to go toÂ  world meetings has to be a role model for the younger people in the world the president has to do alot of work now the vice president has to do what the president cant do sometimes other times hes just there to help the president when he needs him like when the presidents gone on vaction the vice president does his work for him but sometimes the vice president messes up with paperwork so thats why we need to chose the best president not someone random that makes silly laws and to mess up on paperwork and to raise the taxes on the people the president also helps with things going on around the world he also a role model not only to college kids but to highschool kids to so thats why we vote not to pick someone to be specail for the job but to be specail rolemodel for the younger kids he also needs to speak for the people and for his country not for taxeing people or makeing laws its about the people always has been always will be about the people its up to older people and college kids to chose the perfect president if we chose the wrong president are country chould failÂ  and laws chould be broken and taxes whould be high and fights whould happen just one president chould ruin it all for everyone the majority of the college students vote but some dont cause they dont care or either dont beleave in voteing for a guy to run our country some older people dont care for it either but they vote anyway the vice president cant do some of the jobs that our president can do like things to do with the army or with other world leaders it takes alot of skills to deal with alot of screaming people at you like big world leaders yelling at you all day cause you did something wrong or they did something wrong to eachother but the president does a good job cause we voted for a guy that can handle this job that he can handle them yelling at him he can take the pressaure of being a role model a president a father a teacher cause hes basicly teaching the college kids dont give up on your goals they can happen maybe one day a college student wants to be president and the president is their rolemodel basicly he has to teach the world that dont give up when the going gets tough cause if you do then you wont get anywhere in life but if you work hard you can do anything thats why we vote for the president not for a leader whosÂ  bossy and throws laws in our faces but a president whos a rolemodel a teacher a father a leader only one state casts one vote the single representavite from wyoming represents 500,000 voters so image that many voters voteing for one guy to run for our country thats alot of voters but we need that many votes cause we dont know if we pick the right president or the wrong one until he gets into office and starts makeing taxes and laws then we can tell if hes a good president or a bad one we spend a week after just watching what the new president does under pressure he has to go under some tests for a couple of weeks befor we know if hes bad or not the president has to get useÂ  to guards being around him every where he goes cause they have to protect him from danger like bombs and other stuff the president is targeted alot because hes the rolemodel for the usa so are enemies want to hurt him so thats why hes guarded 24/7 
3070	every day and every night and even when the presidents done being the president they still have guys protecting them from danger. 
3071	Another reason why I think we should get rid of the electoral college vote is because it really doesn't make any sense to have it. 
3072	It helps people with an education of like law schools and stuff like that. It helps people in the long run so they no more about the president and the history. 
3073	Over 60 persent of citzensÂ  want to have a electoral college so we can start having to vote for more stuff than to just let it be up to the president and people with a hier power. They say that the electoral college vote was was one of the biggest election crisis in a while it all happened in 2000. Wouldnt you want the right to pick who your presedent is to lead your country for the next 4 to 8 year. 
3074	Wouldnt you like to help call the shots in your state and in your country so your state does turn to crap. So are country stays the stongest to.    
3075	i would make cars to use for transportion but i would not let everybody paid 500 for the car notes. then telvison have a long been fascinated cause it been there longer so when i get done i would make my cars and telvison. we got make alot drive way and it going be alot traffic. some people dont crash that mean it alot people can drives. Some people can't drive because they didnt pay attienion on the road because text and drive then they crash. people like us we follow the direction on the road so we wont get crash or ran over anything so the car wont get hit by any thing. but we can get together on the road some people like to text and die i dont wont nobdy to see that. Some people dont pay attenion to the light on the street oor not in the right lane or turn when u suppose to turn that why we got lot driverless. Then alot people dont got they driver liences. Then people dont be in the lane right turn when u suppose to turn. some people can't park right because they dont pay attetions. that why we dont get caught. if you can't find what you want then u can get a navigating so you can be on your way to whatever your you go. that why driverless are coming. 
3076	I understand your concern about students grades and education, but being unfair to students that have a grade C average is unexcitable 
3077	The electoral college is a process that the founding fathers established in the constition. The electoral college consits of 538 electors and a majority of 278 votes. 
3078	Driverless cars need a whole lot of sensors. Radar was a device on a hiltop that cost two hundred million dollars. We should be investing that money on things that are important. For example help people in need, feed the hungry ect 
3079	Wouldn't the drivers get bored waiting for their turn to drive? we are becoming lazier by the time. 
3080	We shouldn't trust in techonolgy, failure could happen. 
3081	"If we dont get the full call on who is elected then why even vote.  ""We the people  "" means the citizens not over ride the citizens votes and just do what they want. "
3082	Nobody will ever know if aliens made that figure on mars that looks like a face. 
3083	''So there, I proved to you that the face on mars was just a mesa.'' ''I don't care what you say im sticking to my opinion.'' ''Okay what ever, I know i'm right and you're wrong.'' 
3084	Land forms are shaped over thousinds of years. As the years go on the land form gets smaller and smaller. 
3085	All the consperisetheris out ther dont know what they are talking about 
3086	They dont have the evidens to provide like everone else hase. nasa is a groop of scintest the consperisetheris are a groop of craze people. 
3087	"Now all of the evidence should make you want to get away with the electoral college, but if ot then this last paragragh should it will tell you everthing that i already have but in a diffrent point of view. In paragragh thirteenteen of the  ""What's wrong with the electoral college""  source it agrees with every thing that I have typed. "
3088	Why do we have Vice Presient,Presidednt,ect..? Its because of our founding fathers. They decided that it would be easier if we had people controling the world that we live in. They also came up with a system for this its called,Electoral College. this system helps to decide who the President,Vice President,House of Representatives ect,... Each candidate running for Presidentin each state has his or her own group of electors. You can choose your state's electors when you vote for a candidate you are actually voting for your candidate's electors. 
3089	"After the Presidential election,your governor prepares a ""Certificate of Ascertainment"" listing all of the candidates who ran for President in your state along with the names of their respective electors. This certificate also declares the winning presidental candidate in your state and shows which electors will represent yuor state at the meeting of the electors in December of the election year. Your states Certificates of ascertainments are sent to the Congress and National Archives as part of the official records of the presedential election. "
3090	Under the electoral college system,voters vote not for the president,but for a slate of electors,who in turn elect the presient .Voters sometimes get really confused about the electors and vote for the wrong canidate. 
3091	Voters cannot always control who they are voting for but that is ok. the state decides who to pick the elctors thats in first place. Its ok to make mistakes sometimeas. HEY were all human ,no matter what were will never change 
3092	If uyou want to pick a person that you think is best for the job then go ahead and do it. Its your choise on who you pick, not your naighbors. So you decide,make the right desicons.       Â        Â     
3093	A dispute about the outcome an Electoral collage is possible but vary hard to because you may have other poeple wanting it but may not see it your way. Every electal vote needs a presdintal vote to so if we do the math you have a state and a country aginst you so the odds arent in your favor. Now there is a method called winner takes all and it basicaly what they say gose! 
3094	Poeple like the presedent or the electoral collage. So you may not know where your life is headed but is it ok to have them choses your life off of some vote you had no clue you picked him. well then do agree whit the electoral college. 
3095	The NASA workers think that that the face was created by aliens. I don't think it is so. 
3096	When they say that the aliens made the Face, you might not want to go with it because they might research it, but they also might assume what it is right away 
3097	And how they thought it was a face in 1976, they might of not had good technology in the 1900s. And they still believed it when they took the 2001 picture, and they even have good technology now. I don't know if they still believe it now, but if they do, that is suprising me. 
3098	When people put anything online about how they think it something, don't believe it until you see it yourselve. Either on the computer, or a book. But you don't have to go with what everyone is saying just because they think it is that, go look it up yourself, and if you don't think the image is compared to what they think the image is. 
3099	If the school is trying to change the police they should think of the good things and bad things that would happen.   
3100	The free time that is usable during class and be used at any time for the phones to be used if allowed. 
3101	Dear Senator Im writing you this letter to let you know that I argue with you of keeping the Electoral College or changing to election by popular vote for the president of the United States. 
3102	"The founding fathers established it in the Constitution as acompromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by popular vote of quilified citizens. Your state's entitled allotment of electors equals the number of members in its Congressional delegation, one for each member in the House of Representatives plusÂ  two for your Senators. The presidential election is held every four years on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. You help choose your state's electors when you vote for your candidate you are actually voting for your candidate's electors. The Certificate of Ascertainment also declares the winning presidential candidate in your state and shows which electors will represent your state at the meeting of the electors in December of the election year. Your state's Certificates of Ascertainments are sent to the Congress and the National Archives as part of the official records of the presidential election. At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winner-take-all system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states the know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on thje tightÂ  races in the ""swing"" sates. During the 2000 camaign, seventeen states din't see the candidates at all, inckuding Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters inn 25 of the largest media markets didn't get to see a single campaign ad. If anyone has a good argument for putting the fate of the presidency in the hands of a few swing voters in Ohio, they have yet to make it. The electoral College requires a presindential candidates to have trans-regional appeal. No region (South, Northeast, etc.) has enough electoral votes to elect a president. So a solid regional favorite, such as Rommey was in the South, has no incentive to campaing heavily in those states, for he gains no electoral votes by increasing his plurality in states that he knows he will win. This is a desirable result because a candidate with only regional appeal is unlikely to be a succesful president. The residents of the other regions are likely to feel disenfranchised, to feel that their votes do not count, that the new president will have no regard for their interests, that he really isn't their president.    "
3103	Just leave your phone at home and you can get it when you are going home. I understand if you are in sports and you have to stay after school or you have no ride home that day. 
3104	All I am trying to say is that just leave your phone in your backpack, turned off. Or just leave it at home. I think cell phones in school is a bad and good thing. But my opinion is just leave them off at home or in your backpack, turned off. 
3105	"The Electoral College is not a place, but a process. It was established by the founding fathers in the Constitution. The college consists of electors, which vote for President and Vice President. The College consit of many electors, about 538 that is. There is a certain number of votes that is required to elect the president. Each candidate running for president is his or her own group of electors. The candidate's political party usually chose the electors. Election is held every four years in November on the first Tuesday. There is usually something called a ""winner-take-all"" system, it awards the winners of the presidential candidate. "
3106	Most people don't understand the use of the Electoral College. I think that there should be someone going out to jobs and schools talking to the the new generation and the people with jobs about this Electoral College. 
3107	People always seem to argue about this Electoral College, we calll it a disastor factor. 
3108	There are five reasons for retaining the Electoral College;  1) Certainly of Outcome- A dispute over the outcome of an electoral college vote is possible 
3109	2) Everyone's President- The electoral College requires as presidential candidate 
3110	Now I think we should also get rid of the electoral college because they backed there answer up and i could not.  
3111	There are 5 reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the president and now I am going to tell you what they are:  1.)  Certainty of Outcome 2.)  Everyones President 3.)  Swing States 4.)  Big States 5.)  Avoid Run-Off Elections    
3112	Some people might make a mistake and pick somebody they don't want so if you do it by paper, and give people what the president will do for us peolpe might make the right choise 
3113	So if you really feel the need of taking down the collage go ahead and do it. It will be better and in the future we can make another one and make it bigger and better then the one we have right know. 
3114	It might hurt some people I know that, but once we get the new one they won't be so dissaponited because you got ridd of the old one. 
3115	I know there is the bigger states butÂ  you can always split it boys one one side and all the girls on the other 
3116	So let's make the good choise and lets get ridd of that collage. 
3117	because it would make us happy.  
3118	Like in our core classes after we finish our work and the teacher had nothing for us to do, then we should be able to have our cell phones out during that time too it would be fair. 
3119	Even though the teachers are adults and we are kids we should be treated the same way. 
3120	That's my opinion on this subject 
3121	"They always go to people who decide weather or not they should be approved, wich abviously the should if their whole or majority of the state voted for him/her. But thats not what the the feel, they feel like they need to aprove the runners. ""why?"", you ask? I'm not sure. If they need to do all that, why dont the people of the House Of Representatives just make their decisions? Since it always come down to them, then there's no point of the U.S Citizens voting for president. But then agian, I feel like why should they choose who is the president? If the whole USA are the one's who need to worry about the president. "
3122	People think that it looks like a face and I cant not argue with that 
3123	but I do know that it was not made by aliens. 
3124	If it was made by aliens how would they know what a face even looks like, because I do not think that a alien has ever seen a human face before and therefore how would they know what a human face looks like. 
3125	First of all the system in which the goverment presides is internally corrupt. 
3126	Under the EC voters votes do not count. Even if the entire state votes for one candidate 100% the person representing the state may choose to say that the other candiate won. Therfore messing up the actual count by saying that all the people in that particular state voted for a singular candiate. Now lets be real no state is going to entirely vote for a single candidate,but lets say that Obama's count for Florida was 25% instead of the 75% it supposeably was. Obama would not have won. It is a well known fact that if not for the electoral collage Obama would not have won at all. Same with John Kerry. 
3127	Who are the elcators who voted for him? Who are the electors at all? Well that's something for the state to decide. The state picks up to three people to be the speakers for those states. 
3128	They try to find,(are  SUPPOSED  ) to find a non decided not on any side representative for that state. But that plan has failed. 
3129	"According to S2:""The Indefensable Electoral Collage"" By Bradford Plumer. Richard Nixon,Jimmy Carter,Bob Dole and ETC all agree on abolishing the EC. After Al Gore won the presidental election in 2000 due to the popular vote of the people, The thing best known as the diaster factor came into play. The disaster factor is a fiasco that happens in the American goverment. This happened because according to the law state legislaters are techically responsible for picking electors, and that those electors could always defy the will of the people. In 1960 this happened to then Vice President(also running for the big chair) Nixon. The state corresponders for Hawaii overthrew Nixons oppents electors votes in order for him to win. He cheated to win. He bribed the electors because lets be real who is gonna turn down 50,000 dollars? Its the electors fault that bad leadership comes to America. "
3130	.Being a Democrat myself the way the Electoral Collage is set up is absolutely preposterous.  
3131	The third and final reason for the abolishment of the EC is simple. The votes NEVER count, like ever. 
3132	And im sick and tiredÂ  of stupid presidents winning (like Obama the hijo de puta).No single president is going to be everbodys president even the greats such as Geogre Washington, John F Kennedy and Abaraham Lincoln were not everybodys presidents not everyone agreed on their radical ideas but NOBODY AGREES WITH OBAMA NOBODY!!!!!!!! But because of false votes made by the elctives Obama won anyway. But there is serveral things i would like to conclude with look below. 
3133	Anyway the EC should be abolished because it is a poopoo rule. And....................................................................  WE SHOULD NOT KEEP THE ELECTORAL COLLAGE BECAUSE ITS STOOPID. The end.       Â  
3134	"The companies that have tried to make smart cars say that smarter cars need smarter roads. For example GM created a concept car in the 1950's that could run on a special track. The track was embedded with an electrical cable that sent radio signals to a receiver on the front end of the car. Companies figured since they couldn't make the road smarter they would make the cars smarter. Manufacturers such as Google with the modified Toyota Prius uses lots of sensors, video cameras, radar sensors, a GPS receiver, and an inertial motion sensor. Also a Dubbed LIDAR is used to form a constantly updating 3-D model of the vehicles surroundings using laser beams.  In the 1980's automakers used speed sensors on the wheels for the creation of antilock brakes. Although sensors are not new creations the sensors on ""driveless cars"" tell the car when to slow down, speed up, or even stop. Companies plan on improving these sensors to make driving ""safer"" and so that the cars can actually become ""driveless"". As none of the ""driveless"" cars produced so far are not actually ""driveless"" but still require ""driver assistance"". Meaning the driver can't just sit back and relax they have to stay alert and be ready to take over if something should happen. GM has developed seat ""notifications"" that tell the driver when they are backing into an object. These seats vibrate to alert the driver of the objects behind them.  Some manufacturers plan on bringing information systems such as ""heads-up displays"". These information systems can be turned off as soon as the driver needs to take over. Automakers continue to work to solve the current problems with ""driveless"" cars. In some states it is illegal to even test computer-driven cars. These states will most likely allow them after they have been proven to be safe. \ "
3135	We need the Electorial college for so many reasons. Some of the reasons are so that we can vote and keep all of congress and our President in order. 
3136	We need this mainly for voting, sometimes I can admit that not everything this Electorial College does I agree with. But for the U.S. reasons for staying as one we need this more then ever so that we can vote and so that we can have president and all our different congress people too. 
3137	What if their was a tied would citizens like a machine take thier decision on who's going to be the leader of the United States ? I don't think so becasue a machine doesn't have a right to vote. 
3138	"However, the Electoral Collge ""process consists of the slection of the electors, they vote for President and Vice President"" this shows that the citizens can vote to be the most faithful President to be the leader on this opportunity land. To end, we shouldn't keep something that it's not really showing the voice of each citizens on this wonderful world we have as Ameica. "
3139	Many votes have been barely won because the numbers are so close and high 
3140	There is no point in trying to make some of the kids at this school do comminute service. Some of the kids at this school hate there own comminute. Some of them really love it. Most of the kids at this school would love to do that. there are reasons to make us clean it. 
3141	If there really that selfish they should just go were other people like that act and they can live in a hated place. 
3142	There always will be some one like that in the world. They can act that way or jump on bored with everyone ales. Its not are fault they act like that. 
3143	So i say go for it 
3144	if that was our school i would at least write a banner saying we should have at least be passing five of our classes and we should be able to have a 1.5 grade point average that's when freedom of speech comes in! So o hope if the principle reads this he will agree with me! It should really be that hard if you listen to me? Don't you wont to see everyone out in the football field, or wrestling mat, or basketball court, or even if you are doing cross country? I would be glad everyone wants to be so active and would change it so you could make their dreams come true!! So i really hope you listen to me because its better if you got people that want to do sports but they cant because at least a B grade point average they could be at home doing drugs, something that will get them into trouble so if u change it too my idea they will be where you could see them, watch them so they don't get sent to detention hall (DH) or anything like that! 
3145	Please allow us to bring our cell phones to school. 
3146	But you have to understand that the young people now are at the age of technology which means that we are more comfortable with technology than our ancestors. You have some kids now that can make technology run around in circles, because that's what has been imbedded in to their brains and it just comes naturally 
3147	The Electoral Cellege consists of 538 electors. To be elected president, 270 electoral votes is required. Each candidate running for president has their own group of electors. After the president is elected, your governor lists all the candidates and the names of their representive electors that ran for office.  The Certificate of Ascertainment declares the winning candidate from your state and shows which electors will be representing him or her at the December of the election year. All this information is sent to the Congress and National archieves as a part of official records. 
3148	This is do the the electors being chosen by anyone. when selecting them, there are no set rules.  
3149	If we used democracy, only 51% of voters would be needed. But with Electoral Votes, it keeps little states from having too much power and say. 
3150	I think that if your going to make Congress's choices , able to rule over the peoples , then there shouldn't be two sides of the voting. 
3151	We were so excited when we thought we had just found proof of earlier life on Mars. We thought we had just made one of the greatest scientific discoveries there has ever been. We were joyful when we saw the Face. We thought we found proof of ancient alien life without even looking for it. 
3152	"can you imagine if instead of looking at those ""4"" electoral votes we had to look at each persons vote per state. Instead of knowing within a year or a couple months we'd know by the time the presidents term is up. Americans don't have the patience to wait all that time, ""Time equals money."" Electoral votes are much quicker and the certainty of the outcome of what you as a civilian want living in a certain state is very likely. "
3153	electoral college is a process not a place. 
3154	"the Electoral college work on the selection of the electors where they vote for president and vice president couting each voter by congress. large populations in states lose by virtue in the mal-apportionment in Senate decreed in the Constitution. popular votes were mostly in florida but in the year 2012 when obama was just beginning to be president, he got 29 eectoral votes it was a success in the same margin in wyoming would net the winner only 3 electoral votes. other things being the same alot of large states get more attention from the presidential candidates in a campaign than some small states do. the electoral college is supossed to be a procces for the electors to vote for president and vice president and every 4 years theres gonna be someone new thats facing the president to be voted for the new president of the united states but when the electors come and vote if the president will still stay the president then he,ll become it for another 4 years but if the guy facing his way to be our new president mr. obama will have to stay as vice president. in columbia the district is allocated 3 electors and something like a state for purposes because of the electoral college. the reason in the following discussion the word ""state"" is also refered as the district of columbia. each person who is running for president your state has his or her own group of electors they are generally chosen to the candidates political party but the state laws vary on how there electors get selected on what there "
3155	By my own opinion i really consider of having the votes based off popularity and also facts 
3156	I belive that some of the people that do want to become president someday will not become that because their votes mainly deals with the electoral colloges and what they really when the counts of the votes should be really counted off what the people of the united states really think or who they think our president should really be. Some people think we should have a black president or a white president green,purple,or blue it really doesnt matter in my opinion i think i am speaking for everyone when i say that wewant a person that would make great descisions for the umited states a person that is welling to go above and beyond to make our countrymore better and a safe place to all . And at the end of the day people in america doesnt want or think that it is right to have a female president sitting in the seat of a president,i say simply because the people of the USA doesnt think women have enough power or orders, or authority i think women should have the same rights as men. But at the end of the day i think that the people of the united states should have a right to choose who they want to serve as or president , someone who would make change and make the USA a better and safer place for everyone. Someone whois very well educated and have a outlook or reach of things. 
3157	Reaserchers say this could be an alien, 
3158	but I belive not because not one person has found an alien that was alive.  Aliens have been a myth for quite some time now and no one has really ever seen one. 
3159	The Electoral College was created for Big States, Avoid Run Of Elections and Centainy Of Outcome. 
3160	For example in the 2012's election with Obama and Romney' Obama received a 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to only 51.3 percent of the popular votes cast for him and Romney. Even A very slight plurality in the state creates a landslide electoral vote victory in that sate. Even a tie in a nationwide electral vote can happen because the total number of votes is 538 and 538 is an even number, but it is very unlikely. 
3161	To Avoid Run-Off Elections The Electoral College avoids the problem of elections in witch no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast 
3162	There is pressure for the run-off elections when no candidate wins a majority of the elections of the cast and that pressure, witch would greatly complicate the presidentail election proess and is reduced by the Electoral College witch invariably produces a clen winner.    
3163	The electonÂ could have a bias opinion and go against what the people want 
3164	"""It's offical: The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational."" Â Also, in 1976 if a mere 5,559 voter in Ohio and 3,687 voters in Hawaii would have voted differently it would have been a tie. Â That would have been a catastrophe.  In 960 segregationist almost succeded in replacing the democratic electors with electors who would haved picked John F. Kennedy's opponent. Â Also, during the 1960's in Hawaii Vice President Richard Nixon had been presiding over the senate, validating only his opponent's electors. Although, he had done so without creating a precedent.  The Electoral College is a non-democratic method of selecting a President. Â The five reasons we have retained the Electoral College despite its lack of democratic pedigree. Â All are practical reasons not conservative and non-liberal reasons. Â With other things being equal other things are not. Â Also, larger states will get more political attention from presidental candidates in a campaign verse a smaller state.Â        Â        Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â        Â        Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â     "
3165	Over all i think it a good thing. They learn how to do good in school and sports and to be responsible. 
3166	because it induces the candidates 
3167	it restores some of the weight that large states loses 
3168	I am writing to you on the concern of requiring all students to perform community service. 
3169	T HELPS THE PEOPLE VOTING 
3170	HELP THE PEOPLE WHO WANT TO VOTE 
3171	THE CANIDATES ARE ALL RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT AND ONE PERSON HAS TO CHOOSE FROM THE CANIDATES HOW IT WILL WORK AND THAT THEY WILL PICK THE ELECTORAL VOTERS TO VOTE AND THATS HOW THEY WOULD VOTEÂ  THEY SELECT A PERSON EVERY FOUR YEARS AND THEY ASSIGN THEM FOR THE ELECTORS THEY ARE OFTEN CHOSE BY CANIDETSÂ  YOU WILL ALSO HELP THEM VOTE BECAUSE THEY VOTE AFTER EVERYONE ELSE  AFTER THE PRESIDENT ELECTION THE GOVENER PREPARES THEY WILL ALSO DETERMINE THE ELECTORS THE PRESIDENTS COULD ALSO PICK THEM THEY HOLD OFFICAL RECORDS AS TO WHAT IS BEING VOTED THEY COULD ALSO ARGUE ABOUT IT AND THATS HOW THEY COULD ARGUE ABOUT IT IT WILL ALSO LET THEM SUCCSED IN WHAT THEY WERE GONNA DO THE ELECTORS WOULD ALSO BACK UP THE OTHER PEOPLE. SO EACH EVERY FOUR YEARS THEY VOTE AND THEN THEY GET TO SEE WHO WINS.  THEY CAN GET 500,000 VOTERS AND THAT GIVES A CHANCE FOR THE PRESIDENTS TO THEY WOULD HAVE 55 REPERSENITIVES TO BACK THEM UP AND GIVE THEM MORE ELECTORAL VOTORS SO THE ELECTORAL VOTERS WOULD HAVE A CHANCE TO VOTE AND THAT THE ELECTORAL VOTERS ARE THE VOTERS THAT VOTE AT THE LAST MINUTE AND THAT THEY BACK THE PRESIDENT UP AND GIVE HIM MORE VOTES THAN THE NORMAL VOTER.  
3172	YES THEY SHOULD KEEP THE VOTERS AND THAT THEY SHOULD KEEP THE VOTERS JUST INCASE THE VOTERS DONT NEED TO COMPARE THE ELECTIONS AND THATS HOW THEY WOULD MAKE THERE FINAL DECISION AND THEN THEY WOULD MAKE THE FINAL DECISION WHO TO VOTE FOR AND IT COMES UP BETWEEN THE STATES.YES THEY SHOULD DO A FINAL VOTE DECISION AT THE END OF IT. 
3173	"he don't care the class he going to feel like if he don't have to do have to work in that class and he don't thing if he going to lost the class, one example is one of my friends he have a oline class but when he is in home he dont work because he dont care because no have one teacher who says ""Work or you no going to pass the class"" and thats one reason. "
3174	My second reason is when the student is taken online classes he just going to finish, he no going to learn 
3175	because he dont care learn he just going to complete the leasons but just that, why? because he dont have the teacher who explaing when he have questions or when he is interesting in something of the class he no have the teacher who know more abaut that. 
3176	EX: you sent them to go pick up trash and they go and they are just playing around they are going to be fighting with the trash throwing it where it was clean then later when they finish playing they are going to see a mess that they are going to get lazy and just walk away and go to another place where its cleaner and if they are trouble makers they are going to do that over and over again. 
3177	"I always get in trouble for taking my phone out when i get OUT of school just because I'm still on the ""school grounds."" They don't do anything about anyone taking their phones out after school if they see you they just ask you nicely to not use it or put it away while on school grounds. "
3178	I belive that the people should get the popular vote and that the Electoral College should not be kept because it doesn't exactly help the people. 
3179	They get who they want even if the people voted differently,which seems extremely unfair to the people. 
3180	The people should get the popular vote becauseÂ if the people wanted the elecltors candidate they would have voted for them instead of voting for the other competitor. 
3181	Some people don't even vote because they know that even if they did vote the popular vote wouldn't win compared to the electoral college (23). It's also who they wanted not what the electors wanted, and it would make the people happier if they got who they wanted and there wouldn't be a lot people trying to vote out the president. 
3182	The people should also get the vote because wouldn't it make sense if the people did get who they voted for anyways? 
3183	Because if who they elected won and turned out to be a bad president then they wouldn't have anyone to blame because it'd be there fault for not voting on a different competitor. 
3184	As you can see, there is no reason to change it so that the president gets his votes by poularity. 
3185	"It might have been good as a teenager but just remember that this is not your Highschool ""PROM"", you dont just win by fame. Being the president is hard work. If you wish to be president, dont jog for it, run for it.  "
3186	"Now future presidents out there just remember that you will required to have a canidate as stated in source 2 . ""THE INDENSIBLE ELECTORAL COLLEGE:WHY EVEN THE BEST-LAID DEFENSES OF THE SYSTEM ARE WRONG""  ? ""The electoral college requires a preisdental candidt to have trns-region appeal. No region(South, Northeast,etc.)has enough electoral votes to elect a president. So a solid regional favorite, such as Romeney was in the South, has no incentive to campain heavily in those states, for he gains no electoral votes by increasing his pluality in states that he knows he will win. This is a desirable result becaus a candidate with only regional appeal is unlikely to be a successful president"". "
3187	This shows that in order to be an amazing president you need a canidate. 
3188	I am in keeping things the way that we have it now. 
3189	But be able to use them on the bus to and from school if they ride a bus 
3190	i personally think that students should be able to listen to their Ipods during a test 
3191	First of all, what is the Electoral College? The Electoral College is a process, not a place. This process consists of the selection of electors, the meeting of electors where they vote for President and Vice President, and counting of the electoral votes by Congress. It consists of 538 electors. A majority of 270 is requited to elect the President.  
3192	"""The Electoral College is a process not a place."" The Electoral college has 538 electors. Two-hundred and seventy electoral votes is established to elect the president of the United States.  Every single candidate running for President in the state that you live in has his or her own group of electors. Usually, the electors are chosen by the candidate's political party, but state laws vary on how the electors are selected and what is their jobs and their responsibilities are in that spot. The presidential election is held every four years on the 2nd Tuesday after the first Monday in November. Generally, a lot, or most states have the ""winner-takes-all"" system tattooed in their minds that all electors to the winning presidential candidate.  After the presidential election, the governor of the state that you live in prepares a ""Certificate of Ascertainment."" That makes a list of all the candidates that ran for president in your state along with the names of their electors. It also shows the winning presidential candidate in your state and shows which electors in December of the election of the year. "
3193	The Electoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance nthat large states lose by virtue of the mal-apportion of the Senate decreed in the Constitution. The popular vote was very close in Florida (in 2012); nevertheless Obama, who won that vote, got 29 electoral votes. A win by the same margin in Wyoming would get the the winner only 3 electoral votes. 
3194	a larger state gets more attention from presidential candidates in a campaign than a small state does, 
3195	the electoral college could have some ups and some downs but facts are that the government are not going to get rid or abolish the Electoral College any time soon. 
3196	I am truely appreciative of what you have done for my state, our city, and to help the country in so many ways that can not be explained. 
3197	Even if the Electoral Colege went away what would the government use as an effect to insinuate a new reaveling method on choosing the president? 
3198	Also the Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal. No region has enough electoral votes to elect a president. 
3199	Many kids are not able to participate in these sports because of the new 'school law' you just brought up 
3200	Technically, you have just risen the bullying rate to 76.5%, yep, I just went there... 
3201	There are so many good reasons why we should keep this form of voting 
3202	Some more key points are some more notes in the first and last writing. 
3203	"As stated in the article, ""The Electoral College is a provess, not a place."" It's a compromise between the election of the president voted by congress and the citizens.""  The Electoral College is where meetings are held to establish who our Presidents and Vice presidents are. As stated in the article, ""The Electoral College has 538 electors and a majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the President.""  Each candidate that want to be President that's running in one's state has their own group electors, as stated in the article. ""The electors are generally picked by the candidates political party, state laws vary on how the electors are selected and what their responsibilities are."" "
3204	Other teenagers might think that it is all fun and games 
3205	to me it would be about finding myself and finding who i want to be. 
3206	Never making it just a job. Its work that is always worth it in the long run. Never give up and never bale out on something. 
3207	If your mind is set on it then most likely your going to succeed. It never hurts to try to do something that you believe in. 
3208	When i was in kinder garden my teacher asked me ''STUDENT_NAME what do you want to be when you get older?'' And i answered ... ''TEACHER_NAME i would like to be a veterinarian.'' But now if i got asked that same question i would most likely say '' I want to be a life changer.'' 
3209	we would have cheated every president that was elected during the time of electoral college 
3210	people who have voted for many years would have to learn about this new voting system 
3211	every thing we've worked so hard to achieve will be changed. 
3212	Getting rid of the old way of voting would be like ripping up the constitution because were changing the one thing they wanted most a fair way for all presidents to be elected. 
3213	"Next, Authors reasoned these images would be a great way to engage Mars and the other people; it did. The ""face of mars' became a huge icon for twenty five years. Soon it dtarred in films, was seen in books and magizines and most favored in grocery store lines. Photographing Cydonia beame a priorty for Nasa when MGS, Mars Global Surveyor arrived agian in September of 1997 which was a long eighteen years after. "
3214	There is pressure for run-off elections when no candidate wins a majority of the votes cast; that pressure, which would greatly complicate the presidental election process, is reduced by the Electoral College, which invariably produces a clear winner. It can be argued that the Electoral College method of selecting the president may turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state-democrats in Texas, for example,or Republicans in California. Each party selects a slate os electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee and that trust is rarely betrayed. The Electoral College is widely regarded as an person or thing in the past that cannot fit in the present. A non-democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be overruled by declaring the candidate who receives the most popular votes the winner.

3215	People been trying to make a driverless car since the 1950's. They couldn't developed because it was just too expensive. Now that the world have advance a lot in technology is the time to start making new stuff in the world. If a company would dare to do this is going to change the history of the world and it would be in history forever.  Sebastian Thrun, founder of the Google Car Project, believes that the technology has finally begun to catch up to the dream. There was no way that they could make a car like this before 2000 because they didn't have all the technology that we have today. The radar it was just too expensive.  The radar cost it was two hundred million dollars. If the companies now have all this technology around them why not make the driverless car. 
3216	I get that theres going to be fights and drama but still the people has to have the rigth to vote for who they want. I would like to vote too but not for someone to get to pick whatever president he wants. Think of the people, what if you were the people and you wanted to pick your self as president but the congress picks another president just because hes close to winning like you. Were in the United States a place of freedom so let the people vote and let them be free. 
3217	I think that the  Electoral college should omly have one elector. 
3218	Why? because there will be less fights and arguments it will be all up to one elector to pick a president plus all the people that voted. I think it should be a llitle diffrent the elector should vote like a regular person but hes vote costs 500 votes so it will be half fair and helps the president he wants a little. The bad things are that people wouldn't think it's fair and the elector will have alot of pressure. The good things is that there wont be arguments or fights and thats what its all about.       Â     
3219	I trying to understand why we have the system of choosing our state's electors when you vote for president beacuse when you vote for your candidant you are actualy voting for your candidante's electors. This process is easier for most individuals beacause you do not have to sit in a room, for hours, counting up millions of votes; all you have to do is count up the elector's votes in stead. This process is what our founding fathers established in the constitution as a compromise between election of the president by a popular vote of qualified citizens. How can you be a qualified citizen, arent we all the same? I know that the electoral college consists of 538 electors and a majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the president. So, another thing that I would like to know is do you believe that this process that has been going on for ages is still a acturate system. 
3220	"Some of these candidates that people choose are what you call ""faithless"" electors because of the winner-takes-all system. "
3221	"This means that most candidates do not spend time in states they know that they have no chance of winning. Meaning, they only stay focused on the ""swing"" states which in other words means the states that will either go for the person they like or against him. During the 2000 campaign, 17 state had not even seen their candidates at all and the voters in 25 of the largest media markets did not get to see a single campaign ad. So, tell me why we are still using this same system that cheats citizens out of their votes. Is it beacuse we are not qualified citizens? "
3222	I feel community service is important. 
3223	I think there should be a little changes like they need more meetings to choose there president and the vice president how many votes are in to choose there president. 
3224	Even thow if a tie the election would be thrown to the house of represenatives were they decide on the new president. The electoral college is a process its not a place. It shows that the founding fathers established it for the compromise between elections between the president by a vote in congress. The electoral college consists of 538 electors. Plus a majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the president .It say's in the passage that under the 23rd Amendment of the constiton that the district of colombia is allocated 3 electors and treated like a state for the purposes of electoral college. On many cases 60 percent of voters would perfer a direct election. The electoral college system states that voters vote not for the president,but for a state of eletors who elect the president. I think that they should have the right to elect the president that would make this nation grow stonger not to make mistakes and lead us to problems which they can decide to choose the future of the united states. 
3225	Many people have diffrent opinions as me but not all will get the same results as they wanted. The effects of the electoral college has been giving us positive values. As we live on since back of the elections day we are still here becuase of thow,s elections it made us who we are american citizions of the USA.History depends on the future rights of the president thats why the electoral college is there to help make that happen.    
3226	I hear you are trying to make a decision on whether all students should be required to perform community service. 
3227	The future is looking very bright,the best has yet to come. Humanity is growing and advancing more and more everyday. 
3228	it is much easier for kids to just use their phones.  
3229	maybe some people that thinks they are wasting there time should do it. 
3230	The people who think cleaning are environment is good they are so right and some people should learn from them.  
3231	Clean environment means more animals survive and healthy plants for everyone to enjoy. Some people just don't understand natures true beauty in life. All of them think its all electrical keep us alive will is not some of it maybe , but not all. 
3232	Plus that winnier take all thing i really dont like because i like other people to have a chance to see what they say.  
3233	Perhaps in source 1 they have a winner take all system that awards all electors to the winning presidental canidate. The electoral collage is a prosses not a place. It was established by the founding fathers in which they put it in theÂ  constitustion as a compromise. 
3234	Soo yeah honestly you should listen to source number 2 he knows what he talking about so be smart choose wisely.    
3235	because as soon as most people found out there was a black president running they were against it the thought it was the worst idea ever. Instead of giving Mr. Obama the chance he deserved most people were against him. So if it wasn't for the Electoral College Mr. Barck Obama wouldn't have gotten the chance he deserved. Romeney also could've won but that's not the way Electoral College works when voting you are actually voting for a slate of electors and they chose the president. 
3236	will kids should actually bring cell phones to school the reason 
3237	kids could text talk on the phone mostly after school not in school because we all come to learn not to really fool around. if kids keep on fooling around their is no education for them. in free times kids could use their phone it depends if the teachers let them. its not policy that you really have too use your phone like who are you going to chat with when your friends are right next too you. other times in school kids still use their phones and no one actually tells them anything .  
3238	Candidate what do you think of when I say that word well If I had to guess a said president. President that whenÂ  each party selects a president that the peopleÂ  trust to help this Nation. 
3239	candidates focuse their campaign on efforts onthe toss up state. In the article they said Nixonin 1968 and Clintin in 1992 both had only a43 percent plurality of the popular votes. No c candidate win majority.  Did you know that under 23rdAmendment of the constistution the district of columbia is allocated 3 electors and treated like a state for purposes of the electoral college. That what the article told me in paragraph4. Every candidate that is running for president has his or her own group of electors. the majority of 270 electoral votes is rerequired to elect the president. Everyone has to vote if want somebody that own your side. If don't then your voice will never be heard so you have speak up and vote. For who should be president of the state. 
3240	So voting is a big deal so you make sure that you be heard.       Â  
3241	because it consists the selection of the electors and the electors of where they vote for President and Vice President, and the counting of electoral votes by Congress. The Electoral College consists of 538 electors. Majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the President. Based under the 23rd Amendment of the Constitution, District of Columbia is allocated 3 electors and treated like a state for purposes of the Electoral College. You can help choose your state's electors when you vote for President, when you vote for your candidate you're actually voting for your candidate's electors.  
3242	There is pressure for run-off elections when there's no candidate that can win majority of the votes cast. 
3243	No voters vote a nation election, also in that order about one-half the eligible American population did vote in 2012's election. The popular vote was in Florida. Other things being equal, a large state gets more attention from presidential candidates in a campaign than some other small states do. Almost some of the voters are likely to be the most thoughtful voters, on a average type of level, and most thoughtful voters should be the ones to decide the election. 
3244	The things that are wrong with use the electoral college is that is the person gets their votes for thir state the might just win because, the more the people that live there more of the votes that they might get. 
3245	If the congress or whoever was to abolish the electoral congress vote I think we would see numerous of changes in our past history and our future, 
3246	I disagree on this article 
3247	well im in between to story i believe it is going to be like that in the future but also it might not because there going to upgrade the cars or whatever so imma have to say i disagree.  
3248	the reason i disagree is that there going to be better cars than what they is now they just going to keep coming out with new stuff and everything. 
3249	In the future future like 2032 type stuff like that i really dont know cause i dont even know if im still ognig to be living at that time. Yeah they coming out with new cars yes people are still ging to be driving even if the car is old or new you still going to do something.  I mean none is going to walk i know im not but some people might have to of take the bus because they dont have a car or some like that btu other than people is still going to drive and so will i Then again i really dont know if im still going to be here to see it but i still say no people love driving i do i mean i really be really angry if school take away cars like people will be mad and complain becayse thats how they get to places thats how i get to places.  And if u dont have a car you can take a bus our a taxes but a taxes is considered a car to so a train fly and airplane. My final answer is disagree because thats not going to hapened my predition to the world when it becmoes the future if i live to see it. Really the point of this article is would cars still be in the future the article is saying no its not but i really believe yes it would be but to be honest we really would know until we actually seen it for ourself but i mean if they gone take cars away in the that mean they should of been took it this years ago like they would ask use thing in 2012 but its 2016 and cars are still here and going to stay here not thay long like 2045 type stuff if i live to see that year i would be 45. They say that most most driving laws focusing on is keeping driver,passengers and pedestians safe i really dont believe that because if you guys was reakky thinking about that you wouldnt be say you gonig to as if cars are still going to be here in the future.   
3250	another reason is that it would help the men and women who have to clean and pick up trash every day.  
3251	This act could possibly throw some important things off track. For example if you were to go fourth with this act you could possibly risk people selecting the wrong president and his electors,which then could risk people to lose there jobs,homes,end up homeless,etc this could be avoided if you keep things how they are and not end up messing things up changing electoral voting. 
3252	the electors tend to provoke the system 
3253	if there is a way to keep it, we can use it if there is a tie between the Presidency voting.  
3254	Another important reason why the Electoral College needs to be voted out is because the electors in Congress tend to provoke the voting 
3255	The Electoral College is a process, not a place. The founding fathers established it in the Constitution as compromise between election of President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of a qualified citizens. Each candidate running for President has his or her own group of electors. The electors are generally chosen by the candidate's political party. You help choose your state electors when you vote for President because when you vote for your canidate you are actually voting for your candidate's electors. 
3256	It gives people a chance 
3257	help with responsibility, 
3258	Initially, it gives everyone in the political group a chance 
3259	The Electoral College consists of 538 electors. A majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the President. Your state's entitled allotment of electors equals the number of members in its Congressional delegation: on for each member in the House of Representitaves plus two for your Senators. The District of Columbia is allocated 3 electors and treated like a state for purposes of the Electoral College. Everyone in the political group votes. That means if you already did'nt ruin your reputation you have a chance at becoming the president because, everyone on at one point and time in the political party is equal. It also make sure everyon is heard, it makes everyone useful for something. The Electoral College gives everybody a chance which is probably the best detail about the system. 
3260	In addition, Electoral College also hekps with responsibility 
3261	Laws are vary on how the electors are selected and what thier responsibilities are. It can either take away responsibilities or give more resonsibilities. This can help people out alot, people won't get task that they can't handle and other people won't get task that would bore them or would be to easy from. It also gies people restrictions that had already had problems or that had did something something that was'nt alowd. This is helpful to those who are'nt very skilled at something, those who are probably to skilled at something, and those who are probably just in the middle. This is also another great detail why we should keep Electoral College.  
3262	Maybe if a student had the permission to use their phone in school from their parent. The teachers don't allow it but their guardian does. I think the issue should be resolved by parents and not by a student. 
3263	it's not fair that the citizens only get to choose who is their president and who his party choose as Congress, they shouldÂ  be able to choose who helps the president run the country. 
3264	The President basically just signs the papers that can pass a law but the Congress helps say if the law should pass or not.  People should be able also to choose who they want in Congress beacuse, people want a Congress that they know and trust to help our country turn into a better place. Sometimes the Congress only do what they want and feel is right. The Congress that the party choose may also be people that they like and believe will follow how they feel which may not beÂ  how the citizen feel. I know 538 pepole are alot to vote for and add the president, mayors,and commisioners etc., but atleast we'd have the freedom to pick who we want to help run country and we'd also know they'd try and help make our country amazing. Even if it's part of the Constitution they can change it a little like they alot of other things in it. 
3265	In conclusion people should be able to vote because then we'd be able to choose,so they could feel better about knowing who is passing laws and fixing their country. I may be under age but, I know if I were allowed to vote I'd want to vote for who runs my country and who helps run it. 
3266	We should have our background checked on if we should vote or not because , people have faked thier identity and voted , or even forced someone else to vote for them even if they didnt want to. 
3267	the electoral college is a very important process that goes on in this world just to make our place a better one . If our electoral college do better we can have more oppertunities in life, like when the good president becomes president just like obama , He can do good things with the taxes or even make it easier for kids to have jobs so they wont have to be on the streets doing bad things and maybe even one day they would grow up to be able to vote for thier favoritem president.  
3268	I think that you should have a B average and not an A average to play sports 
3269	I think students should wait to get a cell phone because they not going to get nowhere with a cell phone but the same grade over again.  
3270	But we the people also have a say in this economy on what we want not what the government wants it should be up to us weather we want a good leader or a not so good leader but now lets get on to some resons why th electoraal collage should let us the people be the ones to vote. 
3271	To start from the beginning, NASA was just circling Mars taking pictures of possible places where one of the other ships could land. Then it spotted the shadowy rock that looked like a face. A few days after NASA snapped the photo of the Face everyone was engaged in it. 
3272	Sometimes the Electoral College make a well political decision and could problaby help more the government, while the people were just selecting someone that was going to destroy the government 
3273	I think allowing us to have them on and use them, would increase the students in getting in trouble 
3274	Dear princpal i think that kid should be able to use there phone on there free time 
3275	like lunch and then when its time to go back to class they will put them back up and that will be so that kids will not be running out the lunch room and going and the hall doing bad stuff they will be sitting down some where texting and then it will be less fight not saying that we have a lot but i think that it should be a catch to that showing that your grades must be 75%or higher then that then our kids will start getting all there work done they will be trying to get all A'Bs and thing like that all over a little phone can change a lot of things that can be good or bad so lets take and avenge of it and lets get all the good out of it why we can now so that it will no ? about it and we is starting to get bad you can tell us to put them up and do now bring them back out on more or we get them took up and we have to pay 10 to get them back 15 is to much its like you paying for half you bill. that what i think about it. 
3276	For example the electione of 2012 Obama received 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to only 51.3 percent of the popular votes cast for him and Romney. 
3277	I was once asked to write a letter about keeping the Electoral College or changing to election by popular vote 
3278	the electoral votes given to each state. 
3279	Electoral Voting seems very easy 
3280	But this is another reason why the Electoral collge system needs to be changed to popular vote. 
3281	Last But Not Least, The electoral votes given to each state sucks. 
3282	It would be hypocritical if you require it 
3283	and that does not look good for any school if they are proclaimed to be a hypocrite by the public 
3284	Like the saying goes all work and no play makes Jack a dull boy 
3285	it would also in the world of to day make him and his community be the butt of someone else's joke and no body wants that. 
3286	Driverless cars are some what useful for us 
3287	Those who want a driverless cars should still capable of doing the things they do now with a regular car. Senors will still be in the cars, if adding them to the new cars that would make it better for the person and the car. 
3288	Whether they're or no driverless cars people should always be safe while driving. They should always have their eyes on the road and be able to look to their right and left to make sure it is clear to move over. With this coming out people probably think it will be safer or dangerous. They should put things to entertain them so they can be focused on the road instead of their phones. People should still have to take the driving test with their control. 
3289	these here are all the reasons i think community service would have a drastic affect on our community signed 
3290	Now throughout this response i have said/typed what I think is, in a way, best for the school and that is to carry out with the no cell phones in school policy. Because the student might lose his/her cell phone or other electronic device. 
3291	But, i don't think you should have to do community service all the time, because i think that students will get sick of it doing it a lot of times. 
3292	But then again, a lot of people might not want to do it. 
3293	if its so good why do you so many issues with things that happen to people 
3294	thats what i dont understand they dont let some people vote cause there age which is stupid they shouldÂ  let them vote thats the reason why ther areso many disputes in the world cause of the ignorance of some people and the only thing the people from electoral college is worried about iswinning instead of carring for the other people which is not right that is the reason so many outbreaks happen cause people start to not even give a crap about the people that is wanting to vote but the people is not worriedtwo cents about what anyone else thinks their just worried boutÂ  themselves which is stupid and they should have been done something about this before it get to much out of control which is leading to much more problems it needs to come to a end and pick a president who would actually give a care about the people of the united statesÂ  instead them going around and talking about them in different ways that is not needed cause only a majority of people votes for him doesnt mean that he or she has to be a complete jerk to them and start talking bout them in bad ways that is how many fights start and when they start they dont ever stop talking bout it for a long period of time which pisses people off what if someone started talking bout you or your parents you would want to beat the crap out of them then there would be catastrophic failure which leadsto more and more drama which just makes things even worse nominees get happy that they won the vote and start getting all crazy and start saying things just to get people all ticked off and things that really didnt meanto happen happens to people that did not even do anything to hurt that person at all which is messed up cause they dont give no effort to even say they are sorry for what they did to that person the advocates that are in the position they say things that make arguements and other things that dont need to happen begin which doesnt make things any easier it just causes more drama that doesnt need to happen cause even more trouble that is not a good thing to have happen when that happens it just has bad things happening everywhere and it only makes things worse which leads to cause even more drama in peoples life and it doesnt seem fun getting out of all that drama that happened    
3295	Most of the people who dont like this system of voting will most likely say that we the people dont really know any thing about who we are voting and that most of us who are voting for someone are just voting for them just because we have heard good thinds about them 
3296	I'm not going to lie and say that none of the people who do get to vote are all voting because they know their stuff about the candidates, but some of us who do know about the candidates and how they are working should not lose the right to vote for who ever we would like. If we dont get to vote for who we like and believe is better then what type of country are we.  
3297	This causes lots of people to rage on the Electoral college because they feel that the state is taking there right to vote and to be different. 
3298	Some people who are going agaist Elector college use this to trick people and make them go agaist it but if you know about Elector College this wont happen. 
3299	i think we can help this community by helping,clean,stop littering and start helping everyone so that this world can live longer then the outher worlds did 
3300	and communty service is if people that not doing what there not post to do and outhers can do it to help this community and this world will be ok we wont have to find an new home we will just be fine we need to stop all the killing and more help people get back on there feet we need to find pets homes keep people of the streets the crime that's happing we need to try to stop it help people that in need help them like feed them and outhere stuff to make this place an better place we need to help each outher we just need to get to geathere and get alone with one and anthere and bring this world togeathere when we do that then we can stand up for our self and help outhere that need help and save the needes we can do this we cant be scard to do it ya we need some of it but we can help when we get it then when we have the stuff we need we can give the rest to needes that would give them a lot to live for and us to so that what we need to do to this community but we cant do this becouse some people is greaty over money thay will try to teas us with it so we can be just like them but i don't care i share my stuff be when im out i go work for my money then when i get what i need ill give the rest away to the needes i donat food to needes every day to help so those that is in need of help i pray for them and i help an lil girl find her famely she was lost for 20 days i let her stay at my house till we found her famely then i found 200 on the ground i was think for an min what im going to do so i save it and i still got it till this day till i need it 
3301	but the majority of kids would not 
3302	Even though keeping the electoral college may prevent some citizens voting for the wrong person 
3303	we still have some smart people who can vote for themselves. 
3304	If you want the peoples voices to be heard, get rid of your voting backup  
3305	It's not like its going to kill us. But we need to let our school vote on the situation 
3306	But to me I think we shouldn't be doing community service. That is more of a personal decision a person makes for themselves 
3307	And it wont help with our curricular activities 
3308	I also think that middle school kids shouldn't be handling elementary children. We are not certified and do not have a license. Some of the students might also not know C.P.R.. Which eigth graders are learning C.P.R. and are learning the techniques to help anyone. Knowing C.P.R. can decide wether a child lives or dies. I mean everybody knows that kids in elementary school like to chew on toys and sometimes don't chew there food all the way and they start to choke. The middle school children if they don't know C.P.R. they will be scared and will not know what to do. That's why i feel a middle school child should not be handling a elementary child by themselves. The only way that they should be allowed to do so is that they have the child's parent or an adult they know to help watch the child so nothing goes wrong. 
3309	I think if you don't let students have phones in school, then their be no point of having rules. yes i know that students text during classes but their are kids what can you do. 
3310	The Electoral College is widely regareded as an anachronish, a non-democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be by declaring the candidate who receives the most popular votes the winner. 
3311	That cannot be true becasue if the aliens were hidden we would not have such a great picture of the faces. That completly shows that there is proof that this face is just a natural landform. 
3312	Hey OTHER_NAME want to performs some community service hours and pick up some trash.'' ``Ill think about it,'' my friend OTHER_NAME said as he walked away. I dint think he is going to think about it. He is a very lazy person, i guess im all by myself then. 
3313	just look into it and think about it. Or look at all the players grades and see what they have, its not lower then a C 
3314	TEACHER_NAME, if your students thinks it takes to much time of there day, so be it, I'll let the students that really want to and care about there community. 
3315	There has been a lot of talk going around about if you're going to decide to require community service or not. So, I decided to write this letter to you hoping it will make your decision a little easier. I would agree, that there is a lot of controversy over this issues. 
3316	this quote explains how canidates can not get majority rule over the other canidate. Electoral College should be replaced with majority rule 
3317	Even if some kids say they are busy they should have to get the hours in for a grade. 
3318	Most students these days don't help out enough or anything and they need to learn how to help up the community so when they get older they can volunteer to do something like help the community out. I am a student and i think they should make kids to community service not just by kids volunteering i think they should make everyone do it and not by getting in trouble by the cops neither. 
3319	They should net let students bring cell phones to school because it is a distraction from class and that results in bad grades. Another thing is when you go home your parents should check you to see if you have any homework instead of asking the student because most of the time they will say no because they do not want to do the homework or and wanna do something else instead of homework. 
3320	I think the school should have uniforms because people cant make jokes on someone else because of what they are wearing. 
3321	My old school we had to wear uniforms so no-one really made jokes on them for what they are wearing. Its worse to bring a cell phone to school because when you bring it to school its a distraction from class and if you where to be texting in class and get caught and the teacher wants to take your phone sometimes a student will refuse and that will get them more in trouble or the student will give them the cell phone but throw the teacher a attitude and if you are texting in the hallways and knock someone over or fall its your fault for texting in the hall ways they should of left the phone at home or put it in there lockers so they wouldn't get in trouble or i took. Kids should only need cell phone incase of a emergency and like someone gets kidnapped or break in the school the kids can call 911 if they are in trouble. And if someone crazy comes in to the room if a kid has a cell phone they can call the cops or someone for help. 
3322	Humanity believes this land structure is a face left by aliens, we will never know.  
3323	We have to find out and learn.  
3324	"People have questions about this ""face"" on the moon, what does this mean, what next, how did this happen.  That will remain a mystery.  We have seen strange objects in the sky, strange ""ships"" and UFO's and what not.  But we have never had any proof that aliens exist.  we have never seen one, captured one or anything.  But we also have never seen them in space.  These mysterious objects on the moon are just a coincedince.  Until we have proof that we have captured, seen, or caught on camera a extraterestrial thing we cannot say this object was made by aliens.  This land structure could be a manmade structure and we would never know it.  We would never know if othe people made a trip to the moon.  Till we have proof this was not a human manmade structure, it will be a mystery till it is prooved.  There ar thousands of craters, dents and all kinds of odd looking things on the moon, what makes you think this could be made by someone or something.  It will remain a mystery till we know who or what did it. "
3325	Americans are not grateful cause they might not have wanted the same president or wanted different electors. If you wanted to be president and you had good electors people all over the world would vote for you just because the electors you got. 
3326	Policy two you cant even use the phone at all. I think each school that's thinking of having phones should do a vote with the parents and students, and have students write an essay on why they should have phones and if twenty out of one hundred students have a convincing essay about phones then they should be able to have there phones during lunch and passing periods. 
3327	it was describes as a Âhuge rock formation . . . which resembles a human head . . . formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth.Â 
3328	"""We just don't pass over the Face very often."" "
3329	They thought is was made by aliens because they usually don't see this face 
3330	Now that they know it is a natural landform they will always see it.  
3331	"At the beginning everyone thought that aliens made this. ""It has been shown in a Hollywood film, appeared in books, magazines, radio talk showsÂeven haunted grocery store checkout lines for 25 years!"" "
3332	I would like to put my opinion about students being required to perform community service. 
3333	Okay hey, Â I just wanted to introduce myself before we get into this subjectÂ my name is PROPER_NAME and i'm writing about changing the Electoral College to election by popular vote. 
3334	So there is a possiblity that your not going to wind up getting what you wanted out of the outcome. 
3335	In that case, the election would be thrown to the House of Representatives, where the state delegations vote on the president. (The Senate would choose the vice-president on that outcome.) 
3336	It's official: The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. THe best arguments in favor of it are mostly assertions without much basis in reality. And the argument in favor of it are mostly assertions without much basis in reality. And the arguments against direct elsections are spurious at best. It's hard to say this, but Bob Dole was right: Abolsih the electoral college! 
3337	like putting out a flyer or asking if they would like to help clean it up or something to that nature. 
3338	i do think that student should be required to pick up litter around the community, but my thinking has a limit. 
3339	I go to a small private school and we did it last year. I found it alright because I were with my friends and we were talking and making jokes the entire time. Plus we played on the playground when we were done. As strange as that sounds it was a ton of fun. And where we went was a small zoo so I got to look at animals too. 
3340	I remember when we walked there I was playing with my plastic bag and I popped it. I figured out how to fix it by tying it. It wasn't a big rip so I could tie a knot by it to close it up. I certainly had better field trips but it was alright. I hope you use this idea for your school. At a public school I'm not sure how well this will turn out.  
3341	People aren't voting for President anymore which is the most important person in the senate, besides you the right hand man. The Citizen's voting are starting to vote for the state electors do to where they originate or live in. Citizens have not yet grasped the rules of voting and tend to vote unfairly and not for the real reasons we urgently need these people in house,senate, or office. 
3342	which is a good thing. these electors prefer to vote for whoever will do a better job in office and that's what were scoring for with popular votes. 
3343	What happens to votes when there's a run off, because there isn't enough votes to be held accountable for? 
3344	Thats a question to think about , because there could be a lot of problems to be the cause of it. 
3345	"Why choose the majority rule when you could have thousands of People praying for a change vote for a change in their their future for a better life. The ""winner-take-all"" system has to be the most challeging systems of them all but seems to work out after all. ""Electoral College is the best way!"" what happened to the People actually living off of the rules that the Electoral college Voters choose for the people all together? It's time to make a change, why not start now and see how the congress feels. The biggest Decision that should be made should be made fairly by the people, the citizens. "
3346	Big States are the main key. If we could get the big states to take part in the Popularity vote the smaller states will join in. Hoping for the best the Popularity Votes will soon rise and all the discrepencies won't be needed. If you understand where I'm coming from you'll think about what I'm saying if you care about the citizens your trying to help out.    
3347	Most of the time electoral college makes mistakes on who they pick. 
3348	Everything they say is based of an intellectuall standpoint. The pick shouldnt be based off of all intellectuall. 
3349	That doesnt mean the electoral college is bad, if it werent for them I think we the people are too stupid to make the decisons just ourselves. we need intellectual. Most voters dont even know much about who they pick. We shouldnt be trusted with all of the say in the election. 
3350	Now you know at least one student wants it. 
3351	For example the Jhon Kerry ''voting'' if you were in Texas you voted for a slate of 34 Democratic electors that pledged to John Kerry. The Electoral College is a process that makes voting easier for the government. They have to select electors, then they all have a meeting to vote for the President and Vice President, and then the counting of the eletoral votes by congress. It consists of 538 electors. But a major of 270 electroal votes in order to elect the President. Another example John F. Kennedy had a popular that vote would have went to him. 
3352	"the candidates dont spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, which focuses only on the tight races in the ""swing"" states. It as become unfair,outdated,and irratonal. The electoral college is widely regared as an anachronism. We are in need of a change because this has been going on for years and years. So why not change it up i think it should have been done a while ago but it never to late. "
3353	"Which is not every fair some people are'nt as rih as others so they sould'nt descrimate people by the way they look or dress. Because for all you know they look gurst so your not going to try and listen or understand where they came from. But they could be President material they just dont have the outter look, that everyones looking for.""Don't judge a book by it cover."" "
3354	You really should do that but don't get angry if they forget to turn off their cell phones cause a lot of kids always forgets i do. And so does my friends 
3355	So i would pick policy 1 but if their using it in class then i would take policy 2 to teach them a lesson. I wouldn't care if they got mad serve them right. So remember always be fair especially if it's about phones everyone again I'm going to say everyone loves their phones. I would take in to consideration that you would select policy 1  
3356	It even appear on hollywood film, books,magazines, and radio. Maybe it just not close enough to see if it flat or it like mountian. It show a lot of stuff going on on mar. Mar is really history for people in may 24,2001. 
3357	Next, I think it just natural land form because on the shadow it look like pyramid 
3358	They just look at the front they won't know how it shape like to look side to side. Scientist NASA will have to look closer so they can tell if there is alien or not. It depend on to look closer. It just landform because it did have no alien monument. 
3359	"Conclusion, this is all about face of mar well it truth, but if you look at the shadow it show only triangle. it will be better for scientist to look closer instead just making up stories about unmasking the face on mar. It just natural for land to have mountain, and there is no such an alien. according to ther text""There was no alien monument after all"". "
3360	It is the 21st century new things are coming out all the time every one has a cell phone or ipod or something you would think that we would be able to take our electronics to school by now 
3361	also don't you see all that violence out there 
3362	Even though some students in the school think it would be a terrible idea 
3363	"The way we like to live is the better wa, not being forced on how to live our lives. It is also a faster prosses to vote. If the group all are equal then they have to wait a longer time to see who the presedent is going to be and no one wants that. If i can ask you one question its going to be ""how long will you be willing to wait to see who the new presedent id going to be?"" The people of nthe united states dont want to wait, they want to see who the presedent is going to be the week after they vote.  Can we live the way we want to live  ? can we live our lives without something happening that changes everything? Most of the time no, there is always something/someone that changes things in our lives. Like in 2001 the twin towers got hit by a plane, that changed everything. the way we go through airports, the way we fly, the way how people find jobs, and how people look and their beliefs. Some people are judged by what they do for living or what they look like , but thats the point of freedome in the united states. If we have a popular vote in the US they most of that will change and i can garantee that more laws will be fast that will help the US. "
3364	For example florida has 29 electoral votes so if one canadate get 15 which is the magority he will get all 29 
3365	"All these big name car companies are claming to have these ""driverless cars"" soon, but how safe is it going to be for states, and pedestrians on the streets? "
3366	That is why I think the principle should make his students do service hours, so that they can help others.     
3367	it consist of a presidency election on which who wants to be in office. for instance each candidate running for president in your state has his or her own group of electors. which electors are choosen by the political party. 
3368	you ahhve a right to vote. you can help choose your state's electors when you vote. because when you vote your actually voting for your canidate's electors to help them out. 
3369	in your state it shows which electors will represent your state at the meeting of the electors in december of the election year. but then if you think of its actually wrong because its of how many votes can the electors can get not the president. after the presidential election, your state governor prepares a 'certificate of ascerainment'.  over 60% of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we would want to have. this year voters can exspect another close election in which popular vote winner could again lose the presidency, but yet the electoral college has it defenders.  for example like obama had 61.7% of voters against romney who had 51.3% of votes but people say it was a tie which most likely i disagree on that. becuase its a like a win or lose game who ever wins gets the treatment, but really the president doesnt really dont do nothing.       Â    
3370	is about what is eletoral college. It's about who is the founding father who established the constitution. And its about which president gets selected to take the offfice. And it depends on which people vote on which president at the time of voting. And after you selected that president there is no going back to change the answer ant any given point when in the voting booth because once you selected your answer there is no way going bak to change it. And you vote every 4 yrs and presidents cant sttay as president after two term if reelected. And the governor prepares a certififcate of ascertainment for all listing canidate who ran for the president that won the election. 
3371	is about the indefensible electoral college:why even the best -laid defense of the system are wrong. Richard Nixon, Jimmy carter,Bob Dole,the U.S. Chamber of commerce,and the AFL-CIO all ,in their time agreed on Aboilshing the electoral college. but electoral college you you dont vote on the president you vote for a slate of democratic or republican elector to pledged for what ever president you want to vote for. But if they take electoral college away it will cause a disaster factor for all american that want to vote. But the american are all lucky that 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century.  
3372	is about in defense of the five electoral college:five reason to keep ourÂ  despised method of choosing the president. The electoral college is widely regarded a an anachronism ,a non-democratic method of selecing a president that ought to be [overruled] by decaringÂ  the candidate who recives the most popular votes is the winner. But each party selects a slate of electorstrusted to vote for the party;s nominee(and that trustis rarely betrayed).Yet that has happend very rarely. There are 5 reason for retaining the electoral college despite its lack of democrat pedigree; all are practical reasons,not liberal or conservative reasons.    
3373	because of the fact that if the popular vote and the vote in congress were to fail, there would be a backup way of casting, counting and recording votes by a qualified group of citizens, as stated in the first paragraph of the prompt 
3374	I believe the Electoral College should not be abolished also, for the reason that each candidate for president has an amount of electors chosen, varying on the state laws in effect in the given state he or she is being elected from. 
3375	an advantage of the Electoral College is also that the winning presidential candidate is awarded all of the electors in most states, except Maine and Nebraska, stated in the seventh paragraph. 
3376	Second, i think Community Service would be great because most people in our community that are doing Community Service are the people in jail.  To me when i see people doing Community Service i think of that too.  But if you get more kids to do it, people will realize that, Hey maybe this would be good if all people did this. 
3377	If you do accept this policy i think that you should do some sort of phone check just make five or ten minutes for them to check the phones, or even take the phones from the students and then give them back to them before lunch and during the free periods 
3378	It a long time ago that a spacecraft discover Mars. there was a lot of things that the spacecraft found on Mars. Mars is a differnet planet away from here.  
3379	It was twenty five years ago. Thar Mars was discovered by a spacecraft it was going around Mars and found a shadow that looked like a human face and it was getting enormous. The head you could found was from two miles from end to end. The face on Mars is found in 41 degress north martian latitude and also it was winter.  A few days later there was a change that mars is becoming a pop icon 
3380	The Martian mesa just not had a head it also had a mouth,eyes, and a nose like a real human will have. Since the spacecraft discover it. It came out in books,magazines, and radio talk shows. Some people say that there might be life on Mars. The author engage the public to know and attract attention to Mars. For this disover from the spacecraft and the scientist it was hard work to discover Mars Global. The lava dome that is form like a isolated mesa it is the same height as the Face on Mars. 
3381	So in conclusion there could be life on Mars what scientist and the spacecraft discover. It takes scientist and a spacecraft to find these things in Mars Global. it was hard work for the scientist to learn about the mesa and could there be life on Mars.       
3382	Voters in presidential elction are people who want to express a politcal preference rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election.  The Electoral Collge, ancachronism, a non-demoocraticÂ  method of selecting a president that should be [overruled] by declaring the candidate who recieves the most popular votes the winner. The Electoral College method is not democatic in a modern sense. It is the electors who elect the president, not the people. When you vote for a presidential candiate your actully vting for a slate of electors. Our fouding fathers established it. 
3383	A magority of 270 elctors votes are reqiured. 3 Electors and treated like a state of purpose. Running for president has their own groupÂ  of elcetors. Help choose the states electors when you vote for canidate. Governer prepares a Certificate of Ascertanaiment. 
3384	Shouldn't we spend our time and money on something more worthwhile?  To me, this concept of driverless cars doesn't make a lot of sense.  I don't see the point of owning one of these cars.  
3385	f you pick up trash with a group of people it's fun because you become friends with those people. 
3386	I admit the congress does know alot 
3387	but the decesion on the president is going to mostly affect us, the people.  
3388	Everybody has the right to have their own oppinion. 
3389	Online classes is the future and the future is here. 
3390	in the story it's saids that '' Face on Mars'' has since became a pop icon 
3391	If I was a scientist in NASA I would found out how did the peron face came to another planet. 
3392	They have to get out the earth to come to another planet to just put your face on it out of no were. But if a person did put there face inprint on a another planet, I think they will turn into a alien. I will tell you why I said that, because people say that aliens are real and they harm creatures. Also, if I'm the scientist this will tells that a FACE on a human body doing on a another planet they should be on earth. 
3393	In the article it saids: twenty five years ago something funny happening around Mars, NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft was circling the planet snapping photos of possible landing sites for it's sister ship Viking 2 
3394	Also, when it spotted the shadowy likeness of a human face, an enormous head nearly two miles from end to end seemed to be staring back at the cameras from a region of the Red Planet called Cydonia. There must have been a degree of surprise among mission controllers back at the Jet Propulsion Lab when the face appeared on the monitors. But now scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa common enough around Cydonia only this one had unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh. 
3395	But if I'm the scientist trying to figured out all this work,and see who's the human face or a alien face because humans on earth an aliens in Mars or more planets. But afterwards after that happening, it saids how some people think the Face is bona fide evidence of life on Mars evidence that NASA would rather hide, say conspiracy theorists. Meanwhile the defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an acient civilization on Mars. Also, although few scientists believed the Face was an alien artifact photographing Cydonia became a prioprity for NASA when Global Surveyor arrived at the Red Planet in September. 1997, eighteen long years ago after the Viking missions ended. 
3396	Therefore, I agree with what the passage is saying because it says ''The Electoral College consists of 538 electors. A majority of 270 electors votes is required to elect the President. Your state's entitles allotment of electors equals the nu,ber of memebers in its Congressional delegation: one for each member in the House of Representatives plus two for your Senators.... 
3397	That to me explains it all because the college votes can vote for multiple things then the people who vote for the popular votes. So, to me they gave a good enough reasonings. 
3398	Although, popular votes can come in many ways of being helpful because popular votes can help people win by very littler or more. 
3399	On my opino i don't consiter them to change to poplaur voted becasue to me its nothing i agree to keeping the electoral college votes  
3400	Which only goes to show that everyone gets to vote. 
3401	All the college is trying to do is set a number of people who can be elected not elect the president on their own. 
3402	With the Electoral collage it allows for us to make there a set number on the amount of votes we can get. That being said the Electoral collaeg wpuld make it alot easier so the states adn national governmant to get the right amount of votes. 
3403	"With the Electoral College, it all depnds on if you state agrees to have a certain person as president. As informed in ""What is the Electoral College?"" it states that "" The Electoral College consists of 538 electors. A majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the president. This makes it a majority vote i order for you state to win for which ever candianate. "
3404	The Swing States are what determines the election. These states are different for every election becasue they will always find which one is better. The Big States is the states witha lot of electoral votes , including California who has 55 electoral votes. The higher the population the more Electoral votes you have. When a Run off election happens the Electoral College doesnt allow for Majority of teh votes cast. 
3405	For instance if you lived in Texas and wanted to vote for John kerry, you'd vote for a slate of 34 Democratic electors pledged to kerry, they would go to Congress and kerry would get 34 electoral votes 
3406	There are pros and cons for both whywe should keep and get rid of the Electoral college 
3407	Since there are good arguements on both sides, a decision has to be made after careful thought.    
3408	There's five reason to where the Electoral College should be retraining. 
3409	but not everyone really gets a say 
3410	There are certain devices nowadays like a robot on wheels with a screen attached so the student could drive the robot carefullyÂ since it can go only less than 3 mph but can give the child the joy of video games from home and education they need.  
3411	Also its outside the box not every car can be driverless but some can. Just look a lamborghini or ferrari they dont have as much technology as some of the newer middle class cars do.  But your paying $500,000 for some thing that doesnt have as many features as a prius or a smart car. But also driverless cars arent really driveless if some has to take the wheel and go around some things that means the cars not really driveless 
3412	Then they might even fail the grade there in. But people who have a B should be able to choose a sport because there doing well in school. And not failing in school there tried hard so they should be able to choose a sport that they like. But if they start doing bad in school or not doing there homework and start to get an F they should talk to the student. And tell him/her if they have a sport and still have  B average or in the next test they take and get an F. there going to have take away there sport till she /he has better grades. 
3413	because it seems like we do not use all of the votes to have everyone's input on the election. 
3414	"The electoral college consist of 538 electors and a majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the president. My question is ""Why not use all of the electors votes instead of using only anout 55% of them?"". We say that every vote counts but if we are not using all of the electoral votes then that means we are just contradicting our statement. "
3415	I think that kids should be aloud to help kid pick up litter and other things like that to help our community. 
3416	if we start it can really catch on and the more and more we do it the more it catches on to people. just like all of the drinkers out there that through there bottles or can on the ground or the other ones that cant make it to a garbage can or just didn't want to, care ,or feel like putting it in a garbage can. those are the people that we are trying to get through about this situation 
3417	But why do they get to vote for them and we dont. 
3418	because it's only counting Americans who represent the Democratic and the Republican. 
3419	The passage says that they don't see it often and that they use cameras that go small strip by small strip all over the planet and take pictures. Since the Face on Mars has been discovered it has been popular it starred in movies, books, magazines, and people talk about it in talk shows on the radio, also people talk about in the line at he grocery story. It was discovered just about fourty years ago. 
3420	Also if you think about it, it could be worse like even worse than the 2000 fiasco election 
3421	The bad thing about Electoral Colleges is if there a run-off election 
3422	"""The presidentail election process, is reduced by the Electoral College, which invariably produces a clear winner...."" I took it as the Electoral Colleges is the ones to chose the out come of it so why do we vote then if they chose at the end of all of it. "
3423	the last reason Electoral College should be abole to vote is that they dont have all the controle 
3424	"""A dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is possible-it haqppened in 2000- but it's less likely than a dispute over the popular vote"". This shows that the people can also way the vote the way they want it to go if there is a larg amount of you that agree. "
3425	I can see why people say that community service isn't necessary. 
3426	i mean ow could such a puniy creater make such a fuse over a interesting face. Aliens are not real!!  When Fred was rantting about how it had to be an alien and nothing else could have made thoose faces i was thinking that he might have gone crazy 
3427	I mean it could have been alines but most likly not. 
3428	but I also think that changing to the popular vote is also a great idea. 
3429	We should be the people to have the vote on the president and not just a piece of it. Plus the electoral colleges don't even vote on the president,they vote on a slate for the electors who then vote for president.  voting should be on the popular vote now because the electoral colleges are not even voting on the president they're voting on the electors who vote for president. When if there was a direct vote we would then be voting just for the president. 
3430	but not as much as the electoral college does. 
3431	I think that this face is made by alien lifeform because it really looks a face. 
3432	This face could've possibly been a temple or worshiping place for these lifeforms long ago. It could've been a tomb for their leader or king that might've died. If these aliens were going to make a rock this big and that wide it would be for someone or something to catch it's eye. So aliens could've made this or they might not have. 
3433	why i think that we should keep it how it is because is concissed of it concissed of 538 electors and the majority of 270 elector votes is required to elect the president. your state is required to allotment of the electors to equal the number od members in its Congerssional delgation. Under the 23 Amendment the district of columbia is allocated 3 electors. each canidate running for state has the there own group of electors. Electors are genarall choosen by the politial party. you or who ever is voteing helps choose your states electors when you vote. but when you vote for your candidate you ae actually voting for you candidates electors. After the electon there is a Certificate of Ascertainment perpared by the governor listing all of the canidates who ran for President along with the hname sod their electors. 
3434	So as research shown ther are som eflaws in the Elecoral College.       Â  
3435	I argue this because with the Electoral College we get to vote for who we believe is gonna help us out during thier years as President not the choice of the president who we might not believe or trust in anymore to vote for us or the other side. 
3436	If we are voting for president the majority of thr votes goes to the president who earn it which says that these people of the U.S need the president they voted for which is the president who won 
3437	"In ""source 2: The indefensible Electoral College: why even the best laid defenses of the sysem are wrong"" they tell us wee voting for someone we dont want. "
3438	But that is why you learn about your electors and who they want so you choose the one whon is going for you which is your president. Its as easy as doing a little research to find out who your really electing for as president of the U.S. 
3439	sould we keep the elecoral collage or should we change it to election by how many popual votes for being the president of the unioted states 
3440	what is the callage electoral ?  the electoral collage is a compromise between electing a president by voteing in congress and election of the president by how many popalar vote for qualified as to be a president.  teh electoral has many process such as meeting of the electors where they vote for president and vice president, and the counting of the electoral votes by congress.  oto be elected for president u need to have a majority of 270 electorals votes cause the electoral callage consists of 538 electors under the 23rd amendment of the constitution, the district of columbai is allocated 3 electors and trated like a statte for purposes of the electoral collage.  pretty much each candidate running for president in any state has his or her own group of electors.  any president thats running for election is held every fore years on the tuseday after the first monday in novermber.  most states have a winner-take-all system that awards all electors to the winninfg presidential candidate.  elctoral collage they're not alone according to a gullup poll in 2000, taken shortly after al gore thanks to the quirks of the electoral collage won the popular. 
3441	we consider that state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electtors. 
3442	because it make more scence the election always go by votes and who ever have the most votes is elected for the president of the untied state. the eletoral collage system wasnt that good to many things going on i mean like it was kinad of good but not better then election on popaler votes. 
3443	The idea of making school policy that you have to have at least a grade average of a B is a good idea, but you would have more of your star players ineligible to play because of grades. 
3444	For other activities the I can see where having an eligibility grade of at least a B could be a good thing like ski club, that's something that you can do by yourself bu the school provid 
3445	but if they are texting someone or playing with it in class you should take it right away because they aren't even aloud to play with it or text on it in class. 
3446	If they are not calling their close family members or parents then take the phone away and call their parents and tell them about it and tell the student to com get it from the office after school is over. 
3447	Lets say that to win the vote you have to have ten thusand ore votes than your oppint or something like that . I really don't know the best way to do the voting system but this could should be solved by the gonverment and not the high school student that is writing this . Other than that lets move on . 
3448	Both of the system mainly focus on the people so you can't do wrong with ether of this systems . Thatsall I have to say about this system . 
3449	Sometimes all you have to do is update the old system . The system is out datted but if you update it you could make it better . It may or may not work work but you do this right this system could last the U.S.A. a nother 300 years . 
3450	In source 3, It tries to tell you all the possitive things about the Electoral Collage. 
3451	The possitive things they mention about the Electoral Collage are small compared to the issues with it. 
3452	Grades should even go up too. 
3453	I am in favor of keeping the Electoral College or changing it to election by popular vote for the president of the United States. 
3454	The Electoral College consists of 538 electors. It is very rare that the winner of the electoral vote will not win the national popular vote. 
3455	The U.S Chamber of Commerce and some others agreed to abolishing the electoral college. Because of the quirks of the electoral college, won the popular vote but the electoral college still has its defenders. The electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in return elect the president. Although the electoral vote may be unfair to voters it gives the president a better chance of winning the election. There is a dispute over the outcome of an Electoral Colege vote but not likely for the popular vote. For this is because the winning candidates share of the Electoral vote exceeds it's share of the popular vote. For exemple, Obama received 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to 51.3 percent of popular votes for him and Romney, in the 2012's election. 
3456	The Electoral college requires a presidential candidate to have a trans-regional appeal. If you are a regional favorite, as Romney was in the South, there is no need to campaign big in those states becuase no region has enough electoral votes to elect president. Therefore, Romney gains no electoral votes by increasing his popularity in states he knows he will win. It can be argued that the Electoral College method of selecting the president may turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state but, have a less incentive to pay attention to the campaign than they would have if the president were picked by popular vote. Voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a polital preference rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election. 
3457	When the poll is taking place, people should place their votes and have those be shipped off to the Electoral College and have the votes be taken there. 
3458	One of my reasons is that students would get better advantages of getting community service at a high school rather than getting more disadvantages at a middle school. 
3459	it can mess up study time. 
3460	the reason that you should have students do community service at a high school is because you can socialize, work, and you can meet different people in the process and make them as friends rather than helping the same person that you already know. 
3461	and ways to talk to people without actually talking but you will get in trouble if you get caught texting someone during class. 
3462	Many people arent sure what to do when it comes to election. Electoral College is the process that consist of the election. 
3463	The founding father that discovered Electoral College made it easy for anybody to be president. 
3464	Many people also agree with me because according to source 2 it says that in case of the election it will be thrown to the House of Representatives where the delegations vote on the president. This way the delegation people can pick who's good for president. 
3465	Secondly, the Electoral college is widely regared as an anachronism a non- democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be declared the candidate who recives the most popular votes 
3466	The electoral restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states by the population lose by virtue of the mal- apportionment of the senate. The Electoral college avoids the problem of the elections in which no candidate recieves a majority of the votes cast. 
3467	So this is the best choice of what to do and thanks for reading.  
3468	You can make an enouncement with their parents telling the parents about the community service 
3469	"The third reason is that ""the winner-take-all method of awarding Electoral votes induces the canidates"" "
3470	This means to me that the method helps the canidates so they can win easily. 
3471	It is also easier for them to get what they want meaning they can reallly like choose any president they want and its a high percenatge that they will get that president. 
3472	Also the popular vote overrides the popular vote 
3473	I think you should leave it like how it is because nobody gets to over come power. Everyone in the electoral system have the same amount of power. 
3474	Its keeps everything organized. There is no problem in it, everyone like the way it is but there are couple of people that really don't go along with it. Some of the people that don't go along as what the electoral system says because they like having power. They don't care what the people got to say, they are only worried about having that power and changing the system 
3475	If they every change the system to popular votes for the president it would be a honest choice 
3476	I say that because everyone gonna choice a person then other people is going to count and give out the number, whoever has the highest number win. So I think it would be a honestly choice, but in the system everything is organized, everything is already known. 
3477	Whe you vote for president your are actually have a part in who you would like. 
3478	"most states have a ""winner-take-all"" that awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate. the electoral college is just a process where election of the president by vote in congress and election of the president by a popular vote of qualified citizens. the electoral college process consists of the selction of the electors the meetin of the electors where tey vote for president and vice president and the counting of the electoral votes by congress. "
3479	I myself am a libertairian and i dont much like that this test is asking of me to do something storngly against my belifs and i just think is plain aweful.  All government is inefective and should be dissolved. 
3480	Some other scientist belived the face was an alien artfact. I snapped a picture ten times sharper than the oraginal Viking photos. 
3481	I have done lots of reaserch, and revealed a natural landform. 
3482	After more and more reasch. There is still no alien monument.  
3483	One reason for keeping it is because the method of selecting the president may turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state. 
3484	Electoral College avoids problems for example Nixon in 1968 and clinton in 1992 both had only 43 percent of popular votes,while winning a majority in the electoral college 301 and 3 70 electoral votes. 
3485	like Obama, who won the same amrgin in wymoing would net the winner only 3 electoral votes 
3486	In this essay of the Electoral College it is questioning to see if the Electoral College realy works 
3487	In my point of view I think that it does because it gives certain reasons to show it does and if it didnt work the would've changed it a long time ago so it shows you that it work and thats why its still around until this day 
3488	The Electoral College helps pick the president and vice president and if didnt have that then it wouldve been total chaos because with The Electoral College it is way easier and faster and is a better process , The Electoral College consists of many electors and electoral votes this is really important because under the 23rd Amendment of the Constitution, the District of Columbia is allocated 3 electors and treated like a state for purposes of the Electoral College. For This Reason, in the discussion the word state also refers to the District of Columbia.     
3489	They could also pick wich one they think is the most proficiant 
3490	Unlike the electorals they choose the people that will decide the president so there for they could and may lie to the judges and tell them a certain thing but then do a different thing that is also a well asked questions. 
3491	Electoral could have a positive outcome sometimes as such it can have a negative outcome. 
3492	Election can also have positive and negative points. But i think that election could have a better chance of succeding because of the voters. Stated in paragraph 11 says ( The single best argument against the electoral college is what we might call the disaster factor.) well there we have it people are already questioning that choice. Some proses that ties that vote could and may not be acurate. 
3493	Election also has some bad features like some might say its the most basic level but it also is unfair in some ways. 
3494	That statement or opinion is based on each individuals point of view. We dont all look at the choices in the same way. That is very important to try to undestand each choice and look at them closely. To be honest i think both have good ideas but election has a better outcome from my point of view. 
3495	Electoral or Election. I say Election both are extremely simialar but also very different. Deciding a president is very important in any situation. The Outcome of choosing then turning out that it was a miss understanding is very ploral. We have to put the outcomes of both out there and examine each and every one closely. 
3496	We cannot always controlÂ  the elector and who might he choose thas way 
3497	its official the electoral college is unfair,outdated and irrational. 
3498	even if they have a tie the house of representative votes on the president not the people . 
3499	The electoral college has five reasons , retaining itself its lack of democratic pedigree ,all are practical reasons , not liberal or conservative reasons 
3500	some say the electoral college fluctuated in the 2000 fiasco and had the biggest election crisis in the century . 
3501	This is why i am against driverless cars.   
3502	In this moment of time people just don't seem to realize that things are fine the way they are. I mean everyone's doing their own thing and living life. Some more than others, but that's the way it has always been. There are some changes here and there but they're minor ones. People just overreact , and make it seem like a big deal when it isn't. That's just the reality of it. It's not going to change 
3503	Swing states- a debated and popular issue amog the electoral college 
3504	"""The Electoral College consists of 538 electors. A majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the President"" (paragraph 3) "
3505	Vote for me the other guy whats to take all your money no vote for me he fail english in high school thats al you hear when its voteing time. they put them all overÂ  likeÂ  the malls sides of roads. Its all stupid they saying things to make eachother look bad but that the end of the day no one is perfect. So what he did in his passed and in high school is just pointless to bring up. As teens and kids we do stuoid stuff but we do grow up so why bring it back up to make you feel better about your self. this is what i really dont get we the people are suppost to vote to see who will be leading us for the next four years but we really are not. 
3506	Then our governor prepares a certificate of ascertainment they all so decllare the winning presidential candidate. I think its all just not worth it all that work for what if we could just vote on who we want and the person that gets the most votes wins.Â  I dont understnd why this have to have all that other stuff that is not needed. 
3507	They have 538 electors whats the point if we the people could just vote why i really dont understand whats the need for them the person with most votes wins i dont see why all that other stuff is nesseasy. 
3508	Whats the point of even voting when your vote doesnt help who you want to be president win. Why should people in office get to have the say? Its not fair for those pople to chose everyones prersednt . Everyone in the United Dtates should have the say of who runs them for four years. No one wants someone who they don't even like calling the shots. Also when we don't get to choose the the people that do choose make it go in there favor and not ours. 
3509	Whe we get to choose our presedent then we will respect him. When you respect someone then you follow what tthey have to say and dont give them crap for it. when someone you dont like is presedent why should you repect them? we sll know you wouldnt and that you would go aginst almost everything they say even if they actully do say somerting you agree about your still not going to respect them be cause tou dont like them.  
3510	Sometimes everyone can be stoborn. And when certin people dont get whet they want then they can do bad things 
3511	That is why I think that you should use Policy 1. 
3512	So here's policy 3 the student are allow to bring they phones to school but at all time it has to be turned off and in your locker inside your book bag.  
3513	So i ask you in the nicest way i can please let the kids play sports and get involved in other actives with a C average. 
3514	because if you have like a F or D you shouldn't beable to play you shouldn't beable to to play that game or something because it not fair to everyone that they cant play an the game but it is fair to the people who get F&D because they shouldn't be making bad grades they should be making good grades if they want to play an that sport it has nothing to do with ever body just you an principal an teacher why you get the grades you get maybe because it the way you acted an the way you play aronud..... And maybe the kids that want to play a sport cant play because of the way they behavior is or the way they talk to grew people... 
3515	Do you want to hear a story? so i was at work cause im a scientist an me in my friend had an agrument about what happen to mars about the facemark. 
3516	the reason why i dont belive aliens are real beacuse i never heard one i never saw one with my own eyes and i also said the face dont look nothing like a alien. 
3517	Last, we came together an said we dont know 
3518	Because if we do not have the right to vote, our way of thinking and our rights is not important. The country depends on the persons who live in there, too. There has to be an agreeementÂ  between the citizens, because there has to be a leader who can be able to defend the country and citizens. 
3519	 The electoral colleges are very important to people and those people want the electoral colleges to stay open and the do not want them to shut down or get taken/knock down. The electoral colleges acctually make voting fun for people and then more people will want to come when they start hearing about it. The longer you keep them open the higher the votes will be and the voting process will be busy because their is so many people there 
3520	The electoral college votes will help the people in the running to become president. Â        Â    
3521	Even though this system has it's down side it also helps them in a lot of ways. this stops you form having a popular vote meaning more then just two parties can send their rep. 
3522	farther more the Electoral college is only used for the president compare the two system by looking at their other branchs their all doing pretty bad right now. Thats why if it ain't broke don't fix it.    
3523	I did that when i went to court when i was out for so may days. 
3524	I also think we should have them at our lunch period too. 
3525	So in effect a candidate would spend no time in that per say a swing state. which the may have a chance of winning.  
3526	"The popular vote means that the president who recieved more votes claims that the state voted more for him/her. The popular vote goes to our ""electors"" and they decide to vote for the President. "
3527	"We should just vote straight up because the election in 2008 was a huge mistake. Obama decides to do whatever he wants. Insurance prices have gone up due to ""ObamaCare"", and now there is a huge, long, and exhausting process to get te see a specialist especially if you need to see one. It is out of control and he needs to do something about it. "
3528	We should abolish the Electoral College because its just a waste. 
3529	"All they do is tally up the popular vote, and say ""OK, im going to vote for Romney since that's what my people want.""Â  Why can't we just vote for who we want instead of wasting our time! The popular vote should be the only way to vote. There shouldn't be a long and hard process to voting. If I go and vote, I don't want to have to know like 60 different people to vote for, I just want to check the box saying that I want to vote for 'so and so' and leave and go home. It is ridiculous about having a whole process to voting. "
3530	they may make straight A' s in one class but when they get to another subject they make an C. Some kids get some subjects and others do not. 
3531	Because it's easier to read when voting 
3532	everything is label right, 
3533	First of all, I believe we should keep the Electoral College for the president of the  United States because it's easier to read when voting 
3534	Furthermore, I believe we should keep the Electoral College for the president of the  United States because everything is label right. 
3535	"In source one, by the Office of the Federal Register, it states that ""Under the 23rd Amendement of the Constitution, the District of Columbia is allocated 3 electors. . . ."". This shows that whatever the 23rd Amendment is under, that's what the District of Columbia is allocated. This is just like an case at court or when you getting arrested. For example, when you are pleged guilty for murder. The judge is going to read every amendment you broke and what's your charges. And everything that's she's reading is made up. It's all labeled in United State Constitution. This is why i strongly believe we should keep the Electroal College for the president of the United States.  "
3536	Lastly, I believe we should keep the Electoral College for the president of the  United States because the president has alot of people to trust in 
3537	"In source one, by the Office of the Federal Register it states that ""Each candidate running for president in your state has his or her own group of electors."" This shows that whoever the president of the United State is choosing for his or her own group of electors has put alot of trust on each and one of that individual. And it's time for the President to see who or who he can't put his trust in. For example, A president has alot of things that we depend on him or her to do for our Country. And the Electoral College is the best way to see if he or she could do it. This is why I believe we should keep the Electoral College for the president of the United States. "
3538	Like say someone at your school got shot or maybe something very bad happened to someone and your texting and calling your parents, grandparents, friends, and other people about what had happened. Well you and your whole school plus the people your texting and calling all the time. They block the phone station so you cant call the real important people like the hospital or police 
3539	That would be bad so the there are PROS and CONS about having phones at schools. 
3540	What's the point of being at school if you're not comfortable. 
3541	because the founding fathers established it in the constitution as a compromise between election of the president by a vote in congress and election of the president by a popular vote of qualified citizens. The Electoral College process consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for the president and vice president, and the counting of the electoral votes by congress. Your state's entitled allotment of electors equals the number of members in its Congressional delegation: one for each member in the House of Representatives plus two for your Senators. The electors are generally chosen by the candidate's political party, but state laws vary on how the electors are selected and what their responsibilities are. 
3542	You help choose your state's electors when you vote for President because when you vote for your candidate you are actually voting for your candidate's electors. The Certificate of Ascertainment also declares the winning presidential candidate in your state ad shows which electors will represent your state at the meeting of the electors in December of the election year. Your state's Certificates of Ascentainments are sent to the Congress and the National Archives as part of the official records of the presidential election. Abolishing the electoral college! According to a Gallup poll in 2000, taken shortly after Al Gore,Richard Nixon,Jimmy Carter,Bob Dole,the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and the AFL-CIO-thanks to the quirks of the electoral college-won the popular vote but lost the presidency, over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now. Under the Electoral College system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president. 
3543	"The single best arguement against the Electoral College is what we might call the disaster factor. Consider that state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors, and that those electors could always defy the will of the people. In the same vein, ""faithless"" electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please. Perhaps most worrying is the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote. In that case, the election would be thrown to the House of Representatives, where state delegations vote on the president.  "
3544	"At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winner-take-all system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the ""swing"" states. It's official: The Electoral College is unfair,outdated, and irrational. The best arguements in favor of it are mostly assertions without much basis in reality. And the arguements against direct elections are spurious at best. It's hard to say this, but Bob Dole was right: Abolish the electoral college! The Electoral College is a widely regarded as an anachronism,a non-democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be [overruled] by declaring the candidate who receives the most popular vots the winner. There are five reasons for retaining the Electoral College. The first reason is certainty of outcome. The second reason is everyone's president. The third reason is swing states. The fourth reason is big states. And the last reason is to avoid run-off elections. "
3545	 It can be argued that the Electoral College method of selecting the president may turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state. But of course no voter's vote swings a national election, and in spite of that, about one-half the eligible American population did vote in election. Voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election [source 3: In defense of the Electoral College: five reasons to keep our dispised method of choosing president]. 
3546	Article 1 says that to Electoral college is meant to be a compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens. The Electoral College consists of the meeting of electors where they vote for President and Vice President, and the counting of electoral votes by congress. 
3547	these are the reason why we should go to people vote for the president of the USA. 
3548	A nother reason is it is stuiped you can have more people vote then a nother guy can get the state vote it cost more .Â  
3549	During one of my experiences, I was working in a soup kitchen in downtown Cleveland.  Although intimidating at first, I helped by serving those who didn't have the same gifts I am blessed with.  Isn't that what we are called to do? 
3550	The thing i disagree with is the car driving by itself because if that does evolve to regular society, then I think we will have something else to deal with. 
3551	"The single best argument against the electoral collage is what might be what we (the american people) might call the disastor factor, We should consdier ourselves lucky that in the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a centry; the system can allow much worse. Back in 1960, segregationists in the Lousiana legislature nearly succeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy. (So that a popular vote for kennedy would not have actually gone to Kennedy)  ""Faithless"" electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party's canidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please. Perhaps most worrying is the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote, In that case, the election would be thrown to the House of Representives. Where state deleations vote on the president, and the senate would choose the vice-president. At the most basic level, he electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winner-take-all system in each state.  Canidates dont spend time in states they know they have no chance of winnning, focusing only on the tight races in the ""swing"" states. During the 2000 campain, seventeen sates didnt see the canidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didnt get to see a campain ad. If anyone has a good argument for putting the fate of the presidency in the hands of a few swing voters in Ohio, they have yet to make it... Originally the founding fathers estabished the electoral college in the Constitutuin as a compromise between election of the president by a vote in congress but i believe that the electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational! Some of the best arguments in favor of it are mostly assertions without much basis in reality "
3552	your supposed to send your personal opinion to vote for the president of your country, not some lazy bum that sits in a chair all year and when time comes to put his vote in he overides yours and the peoples votes for you and not even care because they are getting paid to? 
3553	It only takes two hundered and seventiy votes from the electoral college to elect the president when theres over two billon residents in the united states? You mean to call this a demcracy when its really a underground dictator ship. I dont know how hard it is to bribe a person in a high postion but it is hard to bribe a whole country 
3554	i mean yes theres alot of bandwagon fans and people who really have no idea of whats going on in their country 
3555	but i promise you we wont fool around and compirmise the whole system beliving in our own belifes 
3556	these fancy bosos mignht thuink they know what their doung but they really dont there just a bunch money thisrty pigs and it isnt fair to the people to rely on theb electoeral college to pick the fate of our country as long as we live on it 
3557	"When I read the title for source two i automaticlly agreed with the incredbly percise source because I have been asking myself the same question ever since i first learned about it inÂ  middle school. Every time i would ask the teacher I would always get the same responce ""thats a good question let me get back to you on that."" I know that its not the teacher because im pretty sure the presidnet cant even ansewr that "
3558	We should keep the Electoral College 
3559	its a good process and it keeps us from having the problem of elections in which no candidates receives a majority of the votes cast. 
3560	The Electoral College method of selecting the president may turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no chance of carrying their state Democrats in Texas, an idea of this is like a Republicans in California. The Electoral College needs a presidential candidate to have have trans regional appeal like South,Northeast,etc. With the Elecoral College is un likely than a dispute over the popular vote. It happened in 2000 because that the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College invariably exceeds his share of the popular vote. A example is in 2012, Obama received 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to only 51.3 percent of the popular votes cast for him and romney. 
3561	The Electoral College is widely regarded as a anachronism, a non demorcratic method of selecting a president that ought to be overpowered by declaring the candidate who get the most popular votes the winner. The advocates of this position are right in debatingthat the Electoral College method is not democratic in a modern sense it is the electors who elect the president, not the people. When u vote you're not voting for the presidential u pick yor're actually voting for a slate of electoes. Both party each selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee but that trust is rarely betrayed however it is entirely possible that the winner of the electoral vote will not win the national popular vote. The Electoral college is good to stay.  
3562	The Electoral College helps with Certainty of outcome, Everyone's president, Swing states,Big staes, Avoid run off elections. A tie in the nationwide electoral vote is possible because the total of numbers of votes are 538 is an even number but it is highly unlikely. The new president will have no regard for their interests,that he really isn't their president. The most thoughtful voters should be the the ones to decide the election. So other being equal, a large state gets more attention from presidential candidates in a campaign tham a samll state does. Voters in a presidential elections are people who want to express a political prefernce rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election.       Â     
3563	Electoral Colllege keeps the people in line and gives the people a sense of establishment. 
3564	The election of the president is every four years. This gives people time to decide on a new president and who they want representing their votes. 
3565	if the kids really want top do it but some don't let the kids that want to do and let them have fun. the other kids that don't want to do it. leave them be they don't need to be like all the other people. maybe they want to be doing that work because there lazy or just plan don't want, too.  
3566	but i don't want to any more i cant stand it. 
3567	We need more people to vote the more voters the better it will look,we don't need to beat aound the tree. This make people feel better to vote then doing it another way. 
3568	but they done fixed all that things going well. 
3569	So do you understand where i'm coming from with this. So keep it easy just let the electoral college stay around. 
3570	Not allowing students to use there phones at all 
3571	Only classes are a good reason to use because is a good way to cominitate in aÂ long distance 
3572	but Free online schools, have to be free all schools online for all students they dont have to pay nothing. 
3573	"This is their time to represent with good character and attitude and also have fun and enjoy their time at school . Instead of not being able to play for having a ""C"" grade point average "
3574	Reason of this teens. 
3575	People take classes the way online, some examples, a lot peopleÂ taking that's way because some people are elder; but they things is better to graduate because he/she work and others things. Some people things that's is more better for then I things that's is great to do both side. People can helps another person or example some reason why he/her taking that's journey toÂ graduate. Always one person in class is coming four or less days to schools the attends is so bad students things is better go to work that's why a lot students take that's route. Some students don't matter anythings about the school, however, students particularity not a lot both some person things bad. 
3576	Next reason, offer to learning to night is better too, 
3577	The kid will get there grade up when they can not do it. Your school will win against other school in the united states. your school be know as the best sport teams. 
3578	same other students came from other place for this activities. same kid will leave there families to get this education. those kid go back after there education is finish to help there family. 
3579	same of there grade are C' s and that all there grade in there class room. most kid have grades of a c' s they sould still be in sports or activities. the kid listen, pass test, do they homework just to be in a sport or activities. 
3580	When i vote i like to know as soon as possible and i feel as if we had popular vote it would be faster to do. Opinoins may not be taken inconcideration but my opinion is strong that we should use popular vote i really feel like more people would come to vote if we used that. People may feel like the Electoarl College is too long of a process so they just say oh i dont have to go vote so im not going to. The Electoral College avoids elections but without them how would we know about our future president and how would we know whether or not the person would do a good job at running our country? 
3581	"This will make the incoming president feel appreciated for all the hard work they did to recieve all these votes. They will know that what they are trying to set forward is good for some people and not just for them. Such as paragraph 12 says, ""Perhaps most worrying is the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote."" What would happen then? That's why you should just give it to the person with the most votes because they deserve it. "
3582	Here at our school it would be great to have to require community service it wont just help us but it would also help our future. 
3583	"Acording to source one, the electoral college consists of 538 electors"".""A majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the president"". Thats alot of votes that electoral college needs. "
3584	"for example in reaosn five ""nixon in 1968 and clinton in 1992 both had only a 43 percent plurality of the popular votes,while winning a majority in the electoral college(301 and 370 electoral votes,respectively).alot of people say that electoral college method of selecting the president may turn off potential voters for a candident. people that are in presidental elections are people who want to express a political preference rather than people who think that a singel vote may decide an election.       Â  "
3585	The electors are usually picked by the canidate's political party. Which is good that they have there own because then the votes would just be a landslide on the outcome of it. Then the citizens votes come in and thats when the votes start to seperate in total, because theres more citizens voting for the other runner than there are electors of those running presidents and vice presidents. Now every state has there own amount of electoral votes. 
3586	The third why i think having cell phones on campus is because we all have ore free time to do whatever we have to do. 
3587	i do understand we also have to have a social life and communicate with other students or peers. Not everything is fun and games sometimes we just need to expect the what our parents do what they do because they love and care about us. 
3588	We don't always have to depend on technology to do everything for us. 
3589	Especially cars, way back people didn't depend on cars, because they weren't even invented, but they had to walk where ever they needed or wanted to go. Whether women were with child, someone had a broken leg, or u could've been sick. Either way, they still kept going until the reached their destination. They couldn't depend on all the technology we have today. 
3590	Also people from larger states are complaining about what happens with a tie because if their is a tie the house of representives decide,but the thing that is crazy is that 1) representative from Wyoming would have a much say a the 55) representatives from California. 
3591	"The Electoral College is a process, consider a place. Our founding fathers established it in the our country`s Constitution as a compromise between election of the President by voting in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens.  The process of the Electoral College consists of the selection of the electors. They vote for th President and Vice President, and the counting of the electoral votes by Congress. The Electoral college consists of 538 electors. A majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the President. Your state`s entitled allotment of electors equals the number of members in its Congressional delegation, one for each member in the House of Representives plus two for your Senators. Under the 23rd Amendment of the Constitution, the District of Columbia(DC) is allocated 3 electors and treated like a state for purposes of the Electoral College. Every candidate running for President in your state has his or her own electors group.  The electors generally are chosen by the candidate`s political party, but the states laws vary on how the electors are selected and what their responsibilities are. The presidential election is held every four years on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November, you help help choose your state`s electors when you vote for President because when you vote for your candidate you are actually voting for your candidate`s electors. Than after the presidential election, your governor prepared a "" Certificate of Ascertainment"" listing all of the candidates who ran for President in your state along with the names of their respective electors. The Certificate of Ascetainment also declares the winning presidential candidate in your state and shows which electors will resprent your state at the meeting of the electors in December of the election year. Under the Electoral College system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president "
3592	That is why we should keep the Electoral College, because it to is party of what make our country`s history.  
3593	The Electoral College System is wrong. 
3594	The Electoral College is a process. This process consists of the selection of electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for president and vice presient. The Electoral College consists of 538 electors. A majority of 270 electoral votes is require to elect the president. Under the 23rd Amendment of the constitution, the District of Columbia allocated 3 electors and treated like a state for purposes of the Electoral College. 
3595	but nothings ever gonna be just the way you want right? 
3596	You just have to come up with some agreements you can come up with and share them with the students and see if they agree with you, and they disagree with you than just don't let them in the sport they sign up for. 
3597	If you are able to make that much of a difference in our community, then you most probable will get best principal of the year and maybe you'll get transferred to a high school and be the principal there and then you'll probable have a better salary. 
3598	I along with lots of other people disagree with this argument. 
3599	That is the reasoning behind the fact that I agree with both sides here 
3600	"It's like ""  American Idole  "" you have to perform good, you have to sound good, and u have to be sucessful. You have to get two out of the three judges to say yes in order for you to go to Hollywood. Same thing with the popular vote system, u have to get two-thirds of the popular vote in order to be persident. It's alot better than to worry about who your elector is going to vote for, all they care about (sadly) is the money. We look beyond the money and look at things like: Food, Education, Gas, Roads, Highways, Trade, Money,etc... "
3601	This is my idea what we should do to help our community. 
3602	I strongly believe that community service is something good, 
3603	Furthermore, community service doesn't have to be boring, we could take our friends, or siblings. Then they will learn from our example, we will have company, and our virtues will spread throughout our community. 
3604	Please help us develop a great community, learn great things, and give us different      
3605	Another reason electoral votes aren't right to me is because if a president wins the popular votes but not the electoral votes then it almost seems likes one of the types of votes is useful 
3606	It seems like this because then he/she may not win and become president even though they won the popular votes. The canidates shouldn't have to rely on 2 different types of votes because obviously one isn't fair. I feel that in a situation like this having popular votes is just a watse of time because it seems that the electoral votes are what matter the most. Not having an equal amount of electoral votes for each state really defeats the purpose. 
3607	It's just depends on the kid, but I know most of us teenagers would definitely try for that spot on the team if we just got the chance!  
3608	Oh! You are an atheast? Well then looks like we will have to have a nother conversation some time? Well until then, bye. 
3609	What Would Our Country Yet The World Be Like With Driverless Cars ? Having Driverless Cars Would Have Both Positive And Negative Aspects 
3610	Is Because Buses Have Certain Routes And They Hold More Than One Person . I Assume That The Driverless Car Would Be A Mix Of A Bus And A Taxi Not Physically Though . Meaning It Would Pick You Up Wherever You Are Like A Bus And Taxi But It Would Drop You Off At An Exact Location Like A Taxi . Only Its A Far More Upadated Version Meaning Its Takes Half The gass We Use Not & Can Do & Go More Places Then Buses 
3611	The electors that are chosen have only a little amount of opinions. If the voters would be included there would be a variety of choices of who should win. Every american should be comfortable and certain about who they voted for and if the Electoral College votes contradicts that there can be problems. 
3612	Why have so much going on when you can peacefully just count the votes of the voters and electors together? 
3613	It could let people have a different aspect on the community 
3614	Newton County is not that clean and not everybody is superb in school. 
3615	As you can see cell phones are 
3616	People will not like the idea but they probably haven't tried it out either so they have no real argument as to why this is a bad idea. 
3617	"""What is the  Electoral college?  In the history, talk electoral college. The electoral college consists of the selection of the eletors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for president and vice president, and the couting of the electoral votes by congress.  also, the electoral cogelle consists of 538 electors. a majority of 570 electoral votes is requiered to elect the president. "
3618	According with the test, i agree because all the candidates generally hace responsabilities 
3619	so, they need to demostrate to the people that them can have good ideas for the state. then the people need to have a vote for the best candidate for that can pass to be the new president of the state. 
3620	"each candidate have many obligations with the state the obligation president is better the state. one ""evidence is each candidate running for president in your state has his or her own group of electors"" "
3621	in conclusion, i think that is good be president of a state but a president have many obligations that to accomplish.     
3622	This is the best way for the peoples voice to be recognized and it will make a difference.    
3623	In this article it asks if you can imagine a world where cars are not needed, I am proud to say I can. In American now more than ever transportation is needed mainly for people to get to work and buy food or other appliances. The people in the word are in need of public transportation more than ever. 
3624	This is why I believe we need to invest in building public infrastructure, public cars, and other forms of transportation. 
3625	Let us express our freedom. If teachers can use them let us so we our all equal, and we don't look down on each other. I agree There has to be rules but we also should be aloud freedom. If we couldn't have phones at school how are we supposed to call our parents to come and pick us up. Or if school gets canceled how are we supposed to call them. 
3626	Although, I am claiming to be on both sides of this situation, it may be that I would never purchase this type of car 
3627	Driverless cars may seem fun, which I have never actually been in one nor seen one, but not having to drive seems pretty relaxing, even though you hold the wheel 
3628	, political parties.  
3629	A lot of people hate political parties but, I like them 
3630	Just think about when you were in school and you wanted to be class president so bad. The people who voted for you is like your political party. I know I loved my political party because they helped me win! Your political party helps come up with all kinds of cool ideas to get people to vote for you. Like when I was running for class president my political party baked cookies, passed out fliers and, help me wright my speech! That's just like when you run for president and vice president. Except I don't think they really pass out cookies when you run to be the real deal president! I know I would vote for the president if he or she gave me a cookie! Ha ha ha ha I crack myself up but it's the truth! Hint Hint for the next election I better be at the top of the list if someone decides to give out cookies! 
3631	In some states they have only a limited number of electors depending on how big or small the state is. Also the winner takes all system should go with both presidents because they both worked hard to get there and shouldnt just be left out they should seperate the electors evenly some people cant become the president or vice president so they shouldnt leave out the vice president. 
3632	Researchers found this figure on the planet mars, they found this not only weird but very interseting. They thought lets do more research to find out what actually caused this formation on mars. Reasearchers thought at first that aliens had put this figure on the planet because it is a figure of a human face. They took big cameras up into mars and sized the figure so large so they could get closer pictures of the image.  
3633	"The people that work for NASA believe that it most likely ended up being a formation in mars because of the research everyone has done they have come to find that there are most likely no aliens up on mars. They say this because they went back up and looked some more around the area where the face was found to see if there was a ""alien monument."" Come to find out there was no alien monument around or even located on mars so aliens did not cause this "
3634	When this all came to take place the first day they let the news out it went viral. People were wanting to know what caused this and how was this caused. When they realesed the news from the NASA they thought the same thing well it had to be aliens. 
3635	After all of this was figured out what really caused it, it went more viral than it was before. It was more popular because everyone was talking about it and it occured in Hollywood movies,Books and even talk shows. 
3636	People were wanting to still believe that no landform can just make something like this. They thought how could this be. The planets have their wonders and wow's you just have to let the formations take place and see what amazing things can be done. Also have patience to see what really happened to the item that was found. You might just be amazed for once. Most don't think there could be such amazing feautures on the planets. 
3637	Do you think driverless cars are better than regular cars ? 
3638	"In the last passage it states that i could have been made bye aliens. Compared to all of the things on Earth. It could be a possiblity of aliens making the Face on Mars. For example, in the last passage it says that Garvins say, ""That it slike the lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on a Mars."" "
3639	If students where told that they wouldn't be able to have the rights in participating, unless they have a B average or higher, this would cause them nothing but more stress than what they already have. 
3640	I also think that while the students are doing the service they should have water breaks and other things to keep them not tired. 
3641	Our community can be much better if the students help out. Principle all i am saying is that community service is good for the community , but i am also saying that if the students do get community service, not to push them too hard. 
3642	Im not the only one that thinks this way 
3643	People might think that aiens are real but that saying is just a myth that some people that are nerds will belive 
3644	I use to think they were real and then I figured out they weren't. If they was real then when people or NASA went to a planet or just into space, why didn't those people every see them? If they did exist why wouldn't people take pictures when they were in space of the aliens? Why don't aliens exist? 
3645	If aliens do exist do you think they would attack you if they saw you? 
3646	I would think that aliens would be on earth. What would aliens be like if they were on earth? would the Earth still be the same if they was on Earth. Who would controll them if the did exist. 
3647	Would aliens be in a zoo, becuse they are a weird like creture/human 
3648	people should know that akiens aren't real becuase if they were they would be on earth and people would take pictures and other things. Some could kill you other could hurt you or do other horrible things to you 
3649	In order for the Electoral College to elect a presidant they need 270 votes out of 538 Electors. Each state or country has electors in them. The candidates running for presidant have their own electors. Every 4 years a presidential election is held at the same time on tuesday after the first monday of novemeber. 
3650	"After voting in the election the governor makes a ""Certificate of Ascertainment,"" which is the list of the candidates who ran for presidant. Also, it shows who the winning candidate is in each state. Lastly the certificate is sent to the states congress to keep for records. "
3651	And if you don't get them out thatcher should not be able to take them from you and think that should be a rule. 
3652	Also the popular vote has mostly everyone in the united states voting on it, the electoral vote has only a couple people, they are way outnumbered 
3653	in my opinion what the people say how the president should be determined. If they want it any other way why would they not have changed it by now? no one really likes having to take time out of there day to go vote, if there votes arnt even going to be seen, or heard by people? whats the point of making them do that? 
3654	If we screw up and pick the wrong president then its our fault, but if you all pick the president it'll be your fault if the president turns out to be good or not. Besides the founding fathers founded the Electoral college so we should keep it just for their sake. Anyway the Electoral College consists of the selection of the electors which then when there picked they decide who is the new or repeating President of the United States of America. The reasons I would like to see the Electoral college do good is because the first reason as to why you should just keep the Electoral college is because everyone will want to be president heres an example .The Electoral college requires a presidential canidate to have transregional appeal. If you have a solid regional favorite you go for them states first then you work around to different states to get more Electoral votes but then if you leave that state that was with you all the way then they atomatically switch to the other person that has been campaigning around all the other states and takes your states what are you supposed to do then? The only thing you can do is just go back and try to get your state back..  
3655	What if that happens again? Thats a hard one we can improve the stuff 
3656	like vote on a piece of paper and put it in this huge box and mail that huge box to someone who can talley up the votes so he can get them or something like that. how can we improve the system in a way everybody can join like a website or a likely matter. The president votes only need 29 electoral votes to win. Why not everybody votes not electoral votes. 
3657	The aviods the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of votes and cast. 
3658	What if we do it like we did it back then wouldn't that be easier then doing it the hard way. instead of having a no region have everybody vote. 
3659	Would you include the others since they might feel disenfranchised I know I would, is there no regard for the other states 
3660	Is there appeal for a unlikely to be a successfui president. The winner-take-all program how is that working? It is form on a method of awarding electoral votes induces the candidates. For Example in 2012 election to focus thier campaign efforts on the toss-up states. 
3661	I don't care what google does for driverless cars, I think they may be good for a small town such as Berne, but there are a lot of cons to this whole issue. I think it would be fun to have cars we don't have to drive ourselfs but an issue with that is what if we do get into an accidnet in a bigger city. I'm nuetral on this topic because they aren't truly driverless ars if they still need a driver. 
3662	"If they have 538 electors they have to count them all not 270/538 because its not fair. I am Agree with the ""Certificate of Ascertainment"" they can have a certificate even if they did not won. "
3663	The electoral college have to change for good if they dont they wont see any votes when its time to vote 
3664	Some states have a winner takes all system, and what that system does is awards all electors to the winning presidential canidate. But Maine and Nebraska each have a variation of proportional representation. after the prsidential election, our governor prepares a certificate of asertainment, l isting all of the canidates who ran for president in your state along with the names of their respective electors. 
3665	witch is true because some people fall asleep while actually in controll of the car so taking away the abilty to controll the car would make it much easier of them to fall asleep. 
3666	"The year of the 2000 campaign, Bush vs. Gore, for the presidency is an excellent example of how this Electoral College is unfair for voters. As Bradford Plumer has addressed in an excerpt of his writing: ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong"" from  Mother Jones , he stated that Al Gore did indeed win the popular vote, but however he lost the presidency because of the quirks of the Electoral College. Also stated by Bradford Plumer is that ""The American people should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century; the system allows for much worse"". "
3667	The Face of Mars is located in Cydonia in Mars. Since Mars is mostlikely cloudy, the photos were taken when Mars was cloudless and was in open in Cydonia. MGS had took enough pictures during those times when it cloudless. Pictures were taking for many reasons. One of the reasons was for taxpayers. Jim Garvin, a chief scientist for NASA's Mars Exploration Program, wanted this to happen for profit. But, some other reasons were to learn about Mars and it's surroundings for the next ship to travel there. 
3668	"The Electoral College process consists of the selection of the electorals. When the electors have a meeting thats when they are able to for the President, Vice President that is running for office. The Electoral College consists of 538 electors, majority of 270 electoral vote, is to elect the President. Each state is entitled allotment in its Congressional delegation which means one for each member in the House of Representives plus two for your Senators.  Under the 23rd Amendment of the Constitution, the District of Columbia is allocated three electors and are treated like a state for purposes of the Electoral College. Each candidate that is running in the election has their own group of electors, generally chosen by the candidate's political party. The presidential election is held every four years on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. The voters help choose their state's electorals when they voted for the President, when they vote for the candidate they are actually votin for the candidate's electors. Voters are more likely to pay attention to the efforts the candidate put to win the election like the campagin.  The Electoral College system has a method called ""winner- take-all that awards all the electors to the winning presidental candidate. After the presidental election the state governor will prepare a ""Certificate of Ascertainment"" that which list all the of the candidates that ran for office, along with the names for their respective electors. The Certificate of Ascertainment also declares the winner of the presidental candidate of your state. The Certificate of Ascertainment is sent to the Congress and the National Archives as part of the offical records of presidential election.       Â Â Â        Â     "
3669	Prehaps most worrying is the prospect of the election vote would be tied in the elctorlal vote. In that case the election would thown to the house of represenitives where state delegation vote on the president 
3670	In conclsion this is why we should keep the Electoral college. Because they have plans for back up and everything is orginised for america. Â  
3671	Also, you'll get caught and your phone will be taken away. When you start having free time or lunch period, then its alright for you to use your phone because nobody is teaching you. My opinion is that its better off if we can use our phones while having lunch or break time, so nobody can tell you to put your phone away or take it away from you because its our time to do whatever we want to do.  
3672	Only a few states allow them so far, and what good is a car that is only legal in three states and the District of Columbia if you do not live there.  I think eventually the laws will change enough to allow them to function as long as they are safe and can pass certain tests. 
3673	But if thats not enough then maybe this is why we should keep the electoral college. Even if Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole,and the U.S chamberer of comerce say its wrong and Al Gore. 
3674	But these speculaters dont understand that they are choosing the president and the electors before the vote of the president. 
3675	So, as you can see, I am of a spilt mind as to what I want you to do. 
3676	"I'm in favor of the Electroral college because ""the electoral college method is not democratic in a modern sense"". "
3677	One reason is the certainty of the outcome you wont win if you have more popular votes but less electoral vote 
3678	"""It happened in 2000, when Gore had more popular votes than Bush yet fewer electoral votes"". "
3679	First of all, I believe the popular vote should be kept and the Electoral College brought down. I think this because what if some people dont agree with the opinion of others. 
3680	For example, lets say two people are running too be president of the United States. People vote and everything but then its up too the 538 electors. Then the 538 electors choose who they want as their president, 270 electoral votes is required to elect the President, as weeks go by, the new President is one of the two people that ran too be President was elected. Some people are happy and some people are mad because they put their vote in and they voted on the other person but that other person won and now they are angry.Â        
3681	"First off, the Electoral College is a specified process. This process consists of 538 electors. A majority of 270 electoral votes is manditory to elect the President. The way this works is every state has a certain number of electoral votes, mostly due to population. For example, a larger state with a large population will have more electoral votes than a smaller state. Also, each candidate running for president in your state has their own group of elector. These electors are chosen based opon the candidate's political party, but state laws vary on how the electors are selected and what their responsibilities are. There is a presidential electon held every four years on the Tuesday after the first Monday of the month of November. When you vote, you are helping choose your state's electors. When you vote for President because when you vote for your candidate you are actually voting for your candiate's elecotrs. After your presidential election, your governor prepares a ""Certificate of Ascertainment"" showing all the candidates who ran for President in your state and with the names of their respective electors. This also shows which electors will be representing your state at the meeting of the electors in December of the election year. "
3682	I completely support this plan. 
3683	But i believe if choosing to change the election by popular vote for the president of the United States it would be more fair to the people because they could see by the popular vote. Thats why i believe by changing to election by popular vote for the President of The United States it would be much better for people. 
3684	but there is zero evidence shown to support this 
3685	Well, Mars, though so barren, might has well be considered the earth's twin sister... or brother. The two planet's sufaces have shown some interesting simularities, like water remnants and climates. Not to mention volcanoes. 
3686	if we Electoral College vote it would be harder for us to vote. 
3687	it is a process made by our founding fathers and it is established in the constitution. It is a compromise between the election of the president and the vote of the citizens and a vote of Congress. The Electoral College process is long it consists of many sections like the electors, meeting the electors so they can vote for the President and the Vice President, and counting the votes everyone thata voted. The Electoral College comsist of 538 vots but thwey only need 270 votes in order to elect a President. With that amount of votes they can become presidents 
3688	This concludes why we should use popular vote.    
3689	doesw the electoral college work?  yes the electoral college works 
3690	cause it helps people get into a college that they would like to get into or want to it can make them happy and then later on in life they can make better choices to live free and get god jobs and have anice apartyment and other things of that sort much it is for the. 
3691	''under the electoral college systems voters vote not for the president but for a slate of electors who in turn elect the president if you lived in texas for instance and wanted to vote for john kerry youd vote for a slate of 34 democratic electors pledged to kerry on the off chance that those electors won the statewide.  the electoral college is widely regarded as an anachronism a non-democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be overruled by declaring the canidxent who recevies the most popular votes the winner the advocates of this potion.  a dispute over the outcome opf an electoral college vote is pooible it happend in 2000 but its less likely than a dispute over the popular vote the reasons is that the winning candidtes share of the electoral invaribly exceeds his share of the popular vote in election for example obama receievd 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to only 51.3 percent of the popular votes.  cause most of the states awared electoral votes on a winner take basis even a very slight pluerality in a state landslide victory in that state a tie in the national nationwide vote is possible cause then total number of votes 538 is an even number but is highly likely.    
3692	The Electoral College consists of 538 electors . A majority of 270 electoral vote is required to elect the president 
3693	that helps the election move more swiffer which helps the people give more time to think , adjust , and prepare 
3694	Also they say that the citizens are voting not for the president , but for the slate of elector , who is turn elect the president 
3695	Additionally people are glad well most people are glad who they picked because they're on their side , and plus majority rules and they will just have to pay the price if they mess up . 
3696	I also believe that some teachers would feel benevolent. 
3697	The Electoral College consists of 538 electors.Â  With majority of 270 votes are needed so there is a good chance of getting a fair shot to win.Â  Each candidate running for president in a state has to have there own group of electors which eguals out the odds.Â  The electors are chosen by the candidates political party.Â  In most states they have a winner takes all system but Maine and Nebraska each have a variation of proportion.  The certificate of ascertainment also declares the winning presidental candidate in the state and shows which electors will be representing your state at the metting of the electors which helps us to know who had won the presidental election.Â  Voting for a state election of who will turn elected for president. When voting you would have to vote for a slate of 34 Democratic electors to pledge for Kerry.  Voting for a president is like voting for a state elector.Â  Even though a dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is possible it has only happened in 2000 but its less likely than a dispute over the popular vote.Â  The reason is that the winning candidate shares the Electoral College invariably exceeds his shares of the popular vote.Â  The Electoral college requires an apresidental candidate to have transregional appeal.  The residents of the other religions are likely to feel disenfranchised and that their votes does not count and that the new president will have know regard for their interests.Â  That he is not really there president.Â  The winner of all methods of awarding electoral votes induces the candidates like as seen in the election of 2012.Â  They are likely to be the most thoughtful voters on average and that they will have received the most information and attention from the candidate as the most thoughful voter should be the one to decide the election.  The Electoral College restores some weight in the political balance that large states lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment of the senate decreed in the constituion.Â  Having the electoral College avoids the problem of electiong in which no candidate recieves a majority of the votes cast.Â  It can be argued that the Electoral College method of selecting the president may turn off potental voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state, Democrats in Texas for example or Republicans in California.  Each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the partys nominee and is rarely betrayed, however it is entirely possible that the winner of the electoral vote will not win the national popular vote than Bush yet fewer electoral votes.Â  As some would say the Electoral College is unfair, outdated, and irrational.Â  The best arguments in favor of it are most likely assertions without much basis in reality.Â     
3698	"The new hit ""the face,"" has made its way through tv, and articles all across the world. This phenonim is about a small land form on the suface of Mars that takes the look of a face. There a million hypothesis of what it could be, but we have found what it really is. With research we found a logical reson to how we are correct. Some think its from aliens, and some think its just a natural land form but what is it? "
3699	But a face from an allien, that sounds, and is unlogical. We have done so much reasarch towards this landform. Shadows give it the look of a face, and thats why we can only see it sometimes. In fact mission controllers even said you had to capture it at the correct lighting. But, if it were a real face, you could see it anytime. 
3700	In fact we have logical evedience, there are gigantic storms which would have wiped all the alliens out. 
3701	They would be burried way benith the suface, becuase when Mars has a storm its vicious, and moves dust, dirt, and sediment all over. If there even was alliens they would be covered in hunderds of pounds of dust.  Yet I can see the opposing side saying that since the dust moves around so much how come the bodies couldnt be revealed? This is hundreds of pounds of dust ontop of them. Even though the dust moves so much, there a 1 and a million chnace of it moving above 400 pounds of dust. 
3702	but in the passage ''The Electoral Collage process consists of the selection of the electors,the meeting of the electors where they vote for president and vice president''. They are trying to say that the president only get majorirty of 270 electorals votes but i think if every each person vote like the house of representative and plus two sentors it be a equal number then it will be easier for him so for my oppionÂ  we should change to eletion by popular 
3703	Well each candidate running for president in your state has his or her own group of electors. for example, the electors are generally choosend by the candidate political party, but state laws vary on how the electors selected. and did you know that when u vote for president you help choose a elector because when u vote for them u voteing for your candidate electors. 
3704	so now i am saying reading the passage is very cool with facts telling me what i should pickÂ  but i think by reading it we should change to eletion by popular vote for the president of the u. s. a. so they can choose who should be our electors or candidates ,and rather than people who think a single vote may decide an eletion.      
3705	that people can still steer and accelerte and slow down with just sensors and you can use half of the fuel and aloowing better response aand reduce power from the engine and the sensors make the car safer to drive . but it may not be safe to drive computer driven cars because of malfinction and that can be dangerous and they have to wait to make sure that is is reliably safe to drive it may not be as easy as they make it seem. sometimes the driver has to take over to pull in and out out of driveways to be on the safe side but the driverless car runs on electrical cables wich may not be safe that runs through radio signals to the front of the car. This may be alot of work to just drive a car beacsue of smarter roads and they need a whole lot of sensors on the car but they are still waiting on the law. 
3706	This is a great explanation for the way the face looks. 
3707	Phones have got ton me in trouble may many of times 
3708	One year i was playing softball worming up the pitchers arm for the game i didn't have any gear on not even a face mask to protect my face well my phone rang in my pocket and i was so exited to see what it was. So i looked at the text well the pitcher didn't know that at the time she pitched it and it hit me right in the eye knocked off my glasses and gave me a black eye. 
3709	So, i mean there are many good things about it and many bad things you just have to be smart about what you do 
3710	Many people already text in school but teachers done know that and yes there has been rude comets on them but its part of life. 
3711	Most students are very compatible and can be convinced to do something that might not sound fun or appealing at all; but when it comes to adults putting in their share, they normally don't have the time to do so when they have work. 
3712	We think this because when there is lunch that's our time and when there is free time that is also our time. 
3713	You could argue that it takes time out of the election or that it helps Amricans 
3714	People make up lies and stats all the tiime to get where they want but the never do good. Let me put it this way would you like someone taking care of your faimly whale your away driving your car, kissing your wife making the dissions then when you get back you act like it does not happen? No you would probable freak out yeah. You spend years makeing these system and trying to let the people be what they want but systums like these do not help on any level. 
3715	I watched a very moving movie last night about a man who survided his contry by being a soldier and his comrads gave there lives for this freedom. They want this country to have all the rights for all the people. Not just Ellectors. It affectall of us people get cheated and scandaled out of money from politics all the time this one way that they do it 
3716	The electoral college is based of popularity in a state. 
3717	Online school would be the best choice to many students that just have it the ruff way and not easy. 
3718	Scientists had seen this photeo in the winter of April '98. Someone would have to peer through the camera through wispy clouds. (paragraph 8). 
3719	The reasoning for believing aliens did it is that people want to believe. 
3720	They want to believe that another race of people can exsist. Maybe the aliens are jsut sending a message that they are real. 
3721	My last reason is that us the people of the United States of America do not want no scum bag of a president that does nothing what so ever to our country 
3722	We want a president that is smart and will take care of tha United State, we want a president that will make us feel safe with the decision that he makes, and finally we want a president that we can believe in and that we trust in. 
3723	because winner got to take all system in each state.  it's also dangurios for all the people in US.  If the winner got to take all system in each state, then he able to do anything he/she wants. 
3724	But if it comes to a point where people are skipping class to go text then they should take that privilege away. 
3725	Aliens would'nt accure on mars to make a mark, if they were real they would be much farther then mars. 
3726	because it tells us how a map shows a breakdown of the number of electoral votes given to each state. 
3727	If i was in this position I would choose to do community service to get to know a little about what i am learning. Our community is very important for helping our environment by cleaning up and recycling everything that needs recycled. Education is good it will show you what you want to do before you start you job you went to college for. 
3728	Another one of my reasons for going on this side of the arguement is not only do they have to win over the electoral votes they have to win over the poularity votes. 
3729	That is what I think about the Electoral College.       Â        Â     
3730	The Electoral College allows the electoral votes to be given out by the voters and the population in that state may never actually honestly choose who they want in office 
3731	in other cases itthe presidential canidates haveÂ  more intrest in the bigger states such as Florida. that could boost in the jobs, and advanteges in the bigger states. 
3732	It would make much more scence instead of the whole Congress blah, blah, blah, and stuff. I mean I know that this was created by our Founding Fathers and should show respect, but popular voting won't take as long and much faster too 
3733	"It states that in the article on paragraph 3, the first sentence , ""  The Electoral College consists on of 538 electors  "". Thats a lot of people. But when people try to vote for you, they are actually voting for the candidate's electors.  ""  Under the Electoral Collage System, when voters vote not for the president, but for the slate of electors, who in turn elect the president. If you lived in texas, for instance, and wanted to vote for [John] Kerry, you'd vote for the slate of 34 Democratic electores pleged to Kerry  "" (  Par. #10, Sent. #1-2).  ""  The Electoral College is what we might call a disastor factor. The American people should be lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in the century; the system allows much worse  "" ( "
3734	That is why I suggest making a popular vote in stead. 
3735	If everyone had B `s then we all would be as smart as each other and most likely get the same points on a test like everyone else, then the teachers would question if we cheated or not even though we didn't we just new the correct anwsers. 
3736	"""PLEASE READ WITH CAUTION!"". "
3737	The policy you have are very nice. 
3738	Thank you STUDENT_NAME  for listening 2 my opinion on this cell phone rule in our school! Different rules, different school, different student, different teacher, and different opinions. ;) 
3739	Electoral college is a only voted by congress according to Richard Nioxn,Jimmy Carter and Bob Dole the U.S. chamber of commerce and the AFL-CIO all agreed on Abolishing the eletoral college. 
3740	2. Eelectoral college is voted not for the president its voted for the slate for example if you lived in texas for insurance and wanted to vote for Jhon Kerry you have voted for a slate. Richard A. Posner Electoral college is widely regarded as non democratic method for selecting a president. From this method u can avoid run off elections or Big states. I beleive that this method is not the best. 
3741	3. citizens voting on who they want to be president is more rights for us 
3742	but if thats how the system is set up then it should not be changed because if it does change then maybe everything would be different. 
3743	People dont just want to have anybody as president they want to have someone that they thinks knows what they are doing, they want to vote for that person to become president. They vote for the slate of electors who in turn elect the president. You should keep this going because when I get older I want to vote and im pretty shore that theres other people who want to vote when they get older to. You should keep the Electoral College going. Another reason is we want to have a president that we can trust. We just want to vote for who we want to. We just dont want anybody to be president. The Electoral College is a non-democratic method so there may be know reason we should shut it down. Please dont shut the Electoral College down, you should keep it going and not ever shut it down. Everything else about the Electoral College is good 
3744	This is my letter of why we should keep the Electoral College going and I hope that it will keep going. 
3745	for example no fighting , talking to others with disrespect 
3746	I think if the votes are close then everybody should vote again not just one person outta ten people the state has to choose. Also it is not done professionaly like it is supposed to be. Some people deserve a shot at it but no you guys think that the presidents from the last election should be put back in well no because that same guy who won it last year has the chance to win it again and its not fair if he wins it again. 
3747	The first thing is that everybody should be able to vote the second time not just ten people from each state. If those five outta ten people choose the same then that state wont count and thats not fair at all. Some of the people outta the ten that were chosen either didn't vote the first time or they have no idea what they are doing what so ever and they could possibly mess up the system or they could mess up the votes. 
3748	My second reason is that it is not orgonizes at all. 
3749	First they chose ten random people to vote in the second round of elecion. They won't give anybody else a chance to vote during the second election. MY second most important reason is that in the first election their are more than twenty people on the ballet and now the second election only has two people on the ballet i think theor hould be atleast three or four on the ballet. My last reason is on how they vote for the people of he second election. The way that they do it is not fair they send out a list with twenty names or more on it and they have to check at least two names and send it back and then they count the votes and then the fist ten for each state get to vote for that state do it is like a drawling and they even send it to the people when theor name is on the ballet. 
3750	 My overall reason is that it is not done professionaly like it should be. The same people should be running for president again especially the one who won before because he has another shot at winning again. That means that they change to many things. Like the school food and drinks the food is now healthy and the drinks are diet some kids and teachers have to have sugar or they will not do so good through out the day like if the have diebetes they might need some sugar well they wont get it because all the food is healthy and the drinks are diet now.  Those are the reasons why i dissagree.       Â    
3751	parents wants there kids to go to school because they want there kids to have a better education then, them when there were kids and have a better life. so they don't have to do or find there way around things. parents want there kids to have a easier life. if students don't go to school this there is no reason to even have schools in the first place and just clean the community every day like its a job and don't get paid at all. its better to go to school because when you get to you are paid to go to school. not like its free and you want or you don't want. now this days students, will do anything to get out of class and out of school. students would fly school because they want to give away there one and only chance to find a good job. they would even try to get in trouble and get sent home and there parents don't care if they do that or even if the teacher calls them and say that ur kid however some may say that community is better because it keeps the community a better places to live but some teachers and parents disagree with this because teachers are like your second parents and they want u to go to school then do community service. 
3752	It should be on the peoples votes since they are the ones being affected by the changes. Not by the Electoral College.  The winner-take-all system is not fair what so ever. If there are more votes foe whatever president in that state then the electors will go for that president. This is like bandwagoning for football teams. If they go to the national championship they will change to that team. This voting shopuld change to the peoples votes instead of this winner-take-all system. It is more fair and balanced.  Think of it this way in 2012 that more people voted for Mitt Romney but the electors didnt think so that is unfair. Right? The voting needs to be changed once and for all to a popular vote system instead of the Electoral College. This is the best way for the United States to deal with this madness. One solution and you are one step forward to a better Nation.  
3753	Those were my top three reasons on why we should keep the electoral college. 
3754	I think if your good and sports you can participate in sports 
3755	But you atleast have to try to do better at school. Because if you don't them you can't participate in sports like compate with others school or team. It so cool because, one time I compate with other school in baskteball and voleyball. But we lost In voleyball but in basketball we won. I was So happy because you get so exited and then nervous because then you think that your going to lose but you never know ig you don't try. So I think that if you have a C or B you can still make to the team or do some sprots. When I won I was with a C avarage and my coach. Didn't care she put me because I was good. 
3756	And if i want to do and acticity well if I have a C than, she atleast can check my conduct in class. Or maybe some student don't have a B avarage they could got and C and they could be one of the best. 
3757	But the pricipal want to change the rule right. 
3758	Policy 2 would be a good policy too 
3759	but not as good as Policy 1 
3760	Well according to the 1st source the electorial college process consists of a selection if the electors wich is were they go and have a big meeting of the electors and who is gonna win President or vice president, They look over the counting electoral votes by the congress 
3761	people get to pick who they want by why pick it if you dont pick he most popular vote ,because what if we dont like what you pick ? 
3762	under the electoral college you vote for a state of electors witch meaning you would be voting for the state and the electoral college would vote for president you wouldn't , voters in hawaii and ohio were 3,687 voters had voted the other way. The election is only a few swing voters away from catastrophe. 
3763	what do they mean by winner takes all ? why cant they share half and half its not fair that all the other people running trying to protect and help are country and do all these things dont get any sort of winner thing, to me that is unfair we have people that wanna help and protect us and you say winner takes all i think we should at least share with the other people running 
3764	The electoral college been around for a long time. 
3765	What people thought who they picked was all for change, and just makes their own rules that not helping,but hurting everyone is why the smaller states are up set about it. 
3766	like we don't understand. 
3767	maby when i right this all down he will change his mind. i hope so. 
3768	The electoral college is a place that the founding fathers established in the constitution as a compromise between the election of the president by a vote in congress and election of the president by a popular vote of qualified citizens. The process consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting, where they vote for president and vice president, and counting the electoral votes by congress. The college consists of five hundred-thirty eight electors and a majority of two hundred-seventy votes is required for the election of a president. Each candidate running for president in your state has his or her own group of electors. 
3769	During the two-thousand campaign, seventeen states didnt see candidates at all. Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, the U.S Chamber of commerce, and the AFL-CIO all have the same thing in common, they want to abolish the electoral college. Some electors even have the nerve to occasionally refuse to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please. 
3770	people get to vote on which thing or person they want to be president or vice president and without it people couldnt run nor vote for who they think would be better at running office 
3771	to all american citizens of the united states of Â people wait for every four years to be able to vote on the people they want in office and who they want vice president the one with the most votes is president and the one with fewer votes is vice if there is a tie between the to then they have tokeeo running till one gets the most votes and the other is vice preisdent over 60% iof voters want a direct electon and the rest dont that is over hafe who want it Â the elcetoral college is widely regarded as anachronism a non demoractic method Â of selecting a president not the people but each party is selected a slate of electors trusted to vote for the partys nominee and it is entirly possible that the winner of the electoral vote will not wine the national pouplar vote there are five reasons for retaining Â the electoral college despite its lack of democratic pedigree all them reason not liberal but it is less likely than a dispute over the pupoler vote canditdates share of the vote is possible . 
3772	i think that the electoraal college is to stay and give the right to ther people all over the world and every where elese in the world the electoral votes it what lwts us speak are minds and us have the right of freedom and equalness over the entier world 
3773	i guess you don't realise it but its ok but we just need our cell phones to keep us busy while we are on our free time. and as soon as the bell ring to go to our next class we can turn off our phone but if you see our phones and we are using it u have the right to take it away.  
3774	Well I really think you should give us a try and see if it works but if it do it could or maybe stay that way. but I really think you should give us students a try and see if we can listen to the rules that u provided to us about our cell phones. and I know some of these students listen and some don't but if u try maybe something will work out for you and us students. 
3775	The picture was taken with a camera that had a higher resolution than the camera used by the Viking 1 in 1976. 
3776	If the Electoral College is irrational and outdated, then why do we keep using? Popular voting can be a better idea then using the Eleortial College, with the popluar voting we can the president that makes the United  States a better place to be living in. For the past century there has been war and terroist in the U.S, and the cause to all the violence is because when Senators are suppose to represent our state they say what in their favor. IF we focus on what the people want we will have a better chance of stopping all the battle. People that are serving the armed forces can come home to their children and family, the local news will not talk abou the next war and the disagreement that this country has aganist another. 
3777	So i think that you should make them do it but to make it more fun to make them want to come and invite friends to help. 
3778	In my opinion I think there should be a reason why some of the students want to do community service and not others. 
3779	there are more cons in the situation 
3780	Some canidates will not win a majority of casted votes, the pressure complicates the presidential election, leaving the true, clear descion to the Electoral College 
3781	"Well first if i go back to paragraph 3 Nasa states that they thought from sending the pictures to the pubic it be a good way to atract public attention to fund mar's missions.  ""The face"" became very popular when Nasa first sent it to the public. Also on paragraph 7 the author states that when the Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia ,they found out that ""the face"" was just a regular natural landform. In the year of 2001 the Mars Global Surveyor was able to snap a picture of the landform, as said by Garvin  ""the picture actually showed the Martian equivalent of a buttle or mesa- landforms common around the American West"" "
3782	I don't think the landform is an ancient artifact or any alian artifact i just think its a normal landform that happens to look like a human or alian face. 
3783	These are all of the reasons why I think and belive that we should keep Electoral College.      
3784	if there is a tie then there should have the previouse presedent of the united states vote to brek the tie. 
3785	America was made to give people freedom, so people being able to pick the pesident is a big part of our freedom, and taking that away leaves us with not as much say in big desions such as a presidental election. The people that would probably complain the most is older people because they are use to being able to vote, and taking that away would get them angry I'm sure, and the people complain louder than they do praise. 
3786	It might even make some people turn against their country, but that only goes for the people who are really into politics and voting and things of that nature. People say you can't complain if you don't vote, but if they take that perivlage away, I'm sure you'll be hearing even more complaining than if people have the right to vote, but even so, this up and coming generation isn't really into voting anyways, but it should be avalable regardless. 
3787	"So Therefore, You guys really dont know what the structure is. none of us know what ""it"" really is "
3788	, It might look like a face but aliens are just not relevant enough to believe that they actually did something of this nature 
3789	i personally do Not believe in aliens , well would you blame me ? We have been to the moon, we have had a rover on mars for years ! and what do we get? nothing , just a rocky surface . no aliens , no water , No life period.  
3790	"Nevertheless, even though in paragraph 10 it says, ""that that put out The maximum camera resoulution and each pixel spans 1.56 meters thats still not giving us any proof . We have been on this ""Aliens Are Real"" Stuff for a while now , and we dont have nothing that proves it. "
3791	Don't you guys think that we should just cut it all out the picture ? we are wasting money on absoutely NOTHING.  
3792	But on the down side it can make things very unorganized, having us worry about every little person we have to put into congress. 
3793	It does not let us the people choose. The Electoral Colledge baseecely sees that the citizens of our contrys opions do not matter. They are saying that the Electoral Colledges votes matter the most those are the only once we are worrying about. But thats not true our opion does matter, we are what make up this amazing cuntry not just the Electoral Colledge. 
3794	What is the electoral college? is when the people voten for meeting the President and Vice President of the college, is a process, not a place and is a election of the president by a popular vote of qualified. 
3795	The opinion of people is that is a good form of meeting a President and Vice President the reason for is good an electoral college is because having of discussion the work andÂ  your can see from who vote. 
3796	"One of the reason of What is the electral college? is that having of discussion the work. Acording to the lecture ""  Does the Electoral College Work?  (source1:What is the electoral college?)  "" say thatÂ  "" For this reason, in the following dicussion, the word ""state"" also refers to the district of Columbia."". Is that take one refers the District of Columbia that no is a bag idea tha is a good idea. The conclusion is that is good that saying the discussion of the work and that your can see from who vote. "
3797	"One of the reason of What is the electral college? is that your can see from who vote. Acording to the lecture ""  Does the Electoral College Work?  (source1:What is the electoral college?)  "" say that ""The Electoral College consists of 538 electors. A masjority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the President. Your state's entitled allotment of electors equals the number of members in its Congressional delegation: one for each member in the House of Representatives plus two for your Senators...."" . No to all people that like this because no feel preparate for this so for this no vote. And the concluding for this reason is that no is only good knowing the discussion of the work that is good your can see from who vot and feel preparate for take a decission. "
3798	More people say that no have a problem if have or no have a President or Vice president,this is no good because a President take decission importants and the Vice President help to President to take this decission. For this have take good decission in the moment of the vote. The presidential election is held every four years on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November.  
3799	The conclution of this is that know of discussion of work and know for you one vote and this acording whint this. Â  
3800	"The Electoral Collage process consists of the selection of the electors. Under the 23rd Amendment of the Constitution, the District of Columbia is allocated 3 electors. Each candidate running for President in your state has his or her own group of electors.  Most states have a ""winner-take-all"" system that awards the electors to the winning presidential candidate. After the persidential election, your governor prepares a ""  Certificate of Ascertainment"" listing all of the candidates who ran for president in your state along with the names of their respective electors. Your state certificates of Ascertainments are sent to the Congress and the National Archives as a part of the official records of the presidential election.  The Electorial Collage restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment of the Senate decreed in the Constitution. They avoid the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the casts.    "
3801	There are some kids that don't go to school, having the schhol next to thenm, but there is alot of people out here that are thing to go to school or at less take onlne classes but they can't because they have to wotk some of the people even have two jobs.

3803	Well people should pick up litter and i am going to tell you why: 
3804	First when your community looks bad other people don't want to live in a bad looking community. 
3805	But it stems from the beliefÂ that a student's reasoning behind it are unacceptable 
3806	Yes, some other citizens might go against this claim, 
3807	but they don't know what it's all about.  
3808	"The process of Electoral College voting consists of the selection of the electors (the people who actually get to decide on the vote casted.) Under the 23rd Amendment of the Constitution the District of Columbia is treated like a state, and is ""allocated 3 electors"" for the purpose of voting "
3809	"because ""each candidate has his or her own group of electors"", generally chosen by the candidate's political party,but state laws can vary that determine what or who the party consists of "
3810	"""Because each state casts only one vote, the single representative from Wyoming, represnting 500,000 voters would have as much to say as the 55 representatives from California, who represent 35 million"", also from  The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong  "
3811	I think we should not have the electoral college. Mostly because i dont think i want to learn about swing states and run off elections and stuff. 
3812	"To me it is just unfair, the people who live and breath in this ""great"" country don't even get to say who will manage them and make this country better.  "
3813	It realy grinds my gears, so to speek it isnt giving us freadom in the most free country in the world it is taking away our civil rights as citizens to vote. 
3814	it may seem unfair that the votes we are putting in is for the electors to run but its a show of value it shows the the electors get help with votes 
3815	and so does the president just like it may be in the other side of the green grass as well. 
3816	"(pg22). Obama gotten 61.7 percent of the electoral votes while Romney got 51.3 it seems of electors in the electorial college knew what the were doing now my gas prices isnt over 3 dollars a gallon near meÂ  ""almost all of the states award electoral votes on a winner-takes -basis""(pg18) not only a predident is just not chosen it is a meeting that takes place where they go throughly to pick the vice prsident or the president. "
3817	In each state the cadinate that is running for that paticular has their own group of electors that in safe hands 
3818	because there are some people that don't even care about the earth as much some other people. 
3819	but it is not as good a trade, cell phones, and better grades.  
3820	I don't think its okay because its during lunch time and free periods, students should be socializing at that time 
3821	The radar is a device on a hilltop that cost two hundred million dollars. 
3822	there would not be as many fights they would be in the phone. and wouldn't care who's around just what there phone is doing and it would get there minds off the nasty school food it would keep the students busy the teachers wouldn't have to listen to kids scream as much. the teachers get to play with there phones all day why cant we play with ours at lunch. the only bad thing is it would be hard to get them to put the phones up and if they don't then u take theme up then they would learn to put there phones up when told but that is what i think it is up to you to choose what we do 
3823	I feel as If 90% is not enough for a car to be in charge. 
3824	technology failing, 
3825	the cost 
3826	I think there is some good things about the Electroal College but some things I do not agree 
3827	It takes to much time add all the votes and the persents to see who got the most of the votes. 
3828	Than the senate and the house of representative talk about is and check if they counting is right. 
3829	Not every one gets to vote. 
3830	Maybe if all people got to vote it will be better and will be ble to find out a better count because each state has so manyÂ  electoral votes. 
3831	The thing I don't like is that not everyone has the right to vote and the should. 
3832	It should be a freedom to vote after this is a free country. We also have the freedom of speech why can't we have a freedom to vote. I may understand that not all people are from this country but reall who is thatb is what make us different but, if we would understand it well be better for every to vote. That way it will be more fair than having only those that qulify. 
3833	Another thing is that when we vote the add up how mant people voted for this person and how many voted for the other and that n there they decided who won that state. add up the electoral vote but what happens to the other who wanted the other person they get pushed away and it should be like that. 
3834	Those people should get a say in who the want too not automaticly be part of the one who won that state. 
3835	but the teachers will by attent for their students who has take their classes from home to send their work or to help they studentsÂ when they don't understand or sometimes we stock to do or how to do and then the teachers will by help. 
3836	and that can by a problem when we take the test because many students can fail their test, 
3837	_And it can by hard for the students to graduate because can affect they attend in the school and will many students going to skiping because they can come in the school but they can leave early because they can find a excuse to to leave and to do the attendece at home or just skiping classes and don't doing nothing. WellÂ it okay to come in the school every day because if one has attend in home then all students wasts to have attend at homeÂ  
3838	Do you remember a time you hated cleaning you house?  Well if people hate doing that imagine them doing community service and how that don't have air conditioning like a house do its outside in the hot sunny day and just have water to drink sweet coming down your face. 
3839	some people complain of what they have and what they don't have, 
3840	how hard it is to keep on cleaning everyday of their life. 
3841	But some people are to selfish to give up a little bet of their time to help and keep our community safe and clean for each another i mean how hard is it. Why would they rather live in a nasty dirty place? we should all in school accepted to work together and do community service and change mother earth and livings around us. 
3842	Students are unable to express themselves in the classroom, but after school activities really allow students to be themselves.  It is unfair that school can dictate how a student chooses to express themselves. 
3843	Me personally i think that the whole electoral college thing is kinda dumb mainly because what it stated. 
3844	That paragraph mainly talked about how the electoral college consist of 538 electors, and 270 votes are required to elect the president 
3845	Im not gunna lie there was a little bit of some negatives effect. For example if we would of did popular votes when president John F. Kennedy ran, he would of lost the election and had not became our prsident. Lucily we didnt change the system then, am i right. 
3846	"for example there is atleast 5 good reasons. Hopefully you know all 5 but ill tel you my top 3 reasons on how the electoral college has some good effects. On good positive effect is how hey say it, ""Everyone's President"". What they mean by that is like how no region would have enough votes to elect a president. So a solid regional favorie like Romeny was in the south had no incentive to campian heavily in those states. another good reason was named ""Big States"". They meant like every big state like Texas lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment of the senate decreed in the constitution. "
3847	"One last reason was known as ""Swing States"". "
3848	By that they meant like what had happened with Nixon and Clinton. They both had only 43 percent plurality of the popular votes while winning a major in the electoral college. 
3849	There are many things that can benefit from community service, there are also many things that can not be beneficial. 
3850	There are also bad things that aren't beneficial from community service. 
3851	so there is no good outcome from community service as much as there is a beneficial outcome. 
3852	Because if you have a vote who comptabled to more vote than another vote of citizens it's not fair... 
3853	If you give one vote for one citizens and one vote for all people who leave in United States that's more fairy for the candidat for the Presidential Electoral and for the citizens,  
3854	I think it's as better idea because the election are more fairy and the president can look how many people vote for him after, why a citizens cannot have plus votes than a Electoral College why? 
3855	If you give more votes to a citizenÂ  I think you can have a problem 
3856	because if one citizen have three or four votes there are so much votes and if all the Electoral College votes for the same candidat. He has got more chances be elected maybe.  
3857	It's my personal oppinion 
3858	But i think you should like get the kids who are foot-ball players and form a foot-ball team at our school. 
3859	I hope that I've made a very large and positive impact on others lives.  Because others have made one on my life.  So I hope that you take some time and think about this letter before you make any final decisions.  Because that one decision could impact many peoples lives in all sorts of ways.  
3860	Lastly, i would like to explain that i also think that not every student should participate in certain community service. 
3861	Also, if the person does make a mistake they should be able to unelect them also cause people need what is best for are country. 
3862	When people elect the president they usally go back through there speaches and see what they had promised for our country and make sure it is what they want. 
3863	If it is not what they want they would probably go to the next person who is trying to be the president. When you are electing always make sure you are mking the right decision and make sure that they please you because they could elect that person because of yur vote you never no what could happen when voting. 
3864	Well i dont think it is because they made the country to a bad situation or even smething dangerous like a war. But if they did keep the Electoral College i dont think they would care about the citizens of the united states I think that they would only care bout themselves and whats gonna please them and not everyone else. 
3865	Another reason they might not let students use their phone is because they just don't think they should 
3866	And most people already have a certainty of the outcome of the election, meaning they already know who will win the election based on the number of votes so far in the popular votes section and the electoral section. 
3867	I hope you will be swayed in favor my proposal after you see it is the only logical option. 
3868	I believe that will pull up a lot of students grades. 
3869	Al Gore won the popular vote but lost the presidency, over sixty percent would perfer a direct vote than have the elctoral college vote also. The vote could be very close even if one candidate wins by much in the popular vote due to the presidency vote. If there was a tie in the electoral vote the election would be thrown to the House of Represenstatives. Instead of all that work if there was only a popular vote it would be quick and simple. 
3870	The best arguments in favor of the electoral college not being good are mostly assertions withiout much basis in reality. 
3871	One reason they should take down the electoral college is to same money because some of the goverments moneyÂ  goes to that college that they dont pay for. 
3872	When they heard that the wanted to take down the college all of the electors were kind of furious because the electoral college is where they go to vote for presidents and vote for canidates 
3873	Another reason is that the electoral college is taking too much money for the goverments votes 
3874	Conclusion for these reason the goverment want to take down the electoral college for the electors. 
3875	I know im not even old enough to vote yet and your probably thinking what is this kid talking about but i dont think it is right to vote for the president of the united states canidate and really not even vote for him. 
3876	They say people of age and an american citazen that we can vote then let them vote for who they want they shouldnt have to vote really for an elector people want to feel like there vote matters. The peoples votes should go right to the box and count the votes and see who wins. The electoral college is of no need for the election process we the people can vote for ourselfs please just let us. And i know it isnt really in the writing format the way they want it i just want you to know my oppinoin and i know your probably going to just skim right over this but please if you have the time just please read over this and take the time to understand were im coming from.    
3877	Did you know that there is someone from a small state and they only get three electoral votes. Well, they are not treated equal and only the large states get more of the attention from presidential candidates than a small state ever will. 
3878	Though some people think otherwise. 
3879	Everyone should just vote for the vice president and the president. People are voting for the Electoral college while they should be voting to see who will be their new president. The electoral college is getting more votes than the president should be getting. 
3880	One reason some people chose to have the electoral vote is because the president is winning everything. And the electoral college requires a presidental candidate. 
3881	To them the president isn't their president. The winner/ the president gets all the awards and receive the most infromation. 
3882	Some states are not getting any votes at all. Also candidates are getting the same amount of votes, but differnent amount of electoral vote. They want to see who gets the most votes to be the president the most electoral votes. People vote so they can have a perference. 
3883	"The Electoral College has 538 electors, but to elect the President, 270 electoral votes are needed. One for each member in the House of Representives plus two for your Senators is what your state's entitled allotment of electors must equal and the number of members in its Congressional delegation. In the Constitution under the 23rd Amendment, D.C is given 3 electors and treated like a state for purposes of the Electoral College. ""State"" can also be used instead of using the District of Columbia. Each canidate running for President in each state has his or her own group of electors. The political party is who the electors are generally chosen by but they elect them by giving them different responsibilities. Every four years is when the presidential election is held. I believe that the senator should stick with The Electoral College to vote for the President of the U.S.  When the presidential election is all finished with, the governor prepares something called ""Certificate of Ascertainment"" which lists all of the canidates who ran for office in that particular state. "
3884	Slate of electors are trusted to vote for the President however, he or she is usually picked by the number of how many votes your electors put in for you. 
3885	In 1976, a picture was taken by the satellite Viking 1. The picture on Mars was found to be what looked like the face of an Egyptian god. The pictures taken were blurry but showed to actually be a face indicating there was life on Mars sometime in the past or even here in the present. NASA kept studying this mask for years to come. 
3886	"The electoral college has 538 electors but the president needs to have 270 electoral votes to become the president. The 23 amendment of the contitution allows columbia 3 electors and treated like a state for purpose of the electoral college. When you vote for your candidate you are actually voting for your candidates electors. Every candidate running for president in your state has his or her own goup of electors. Some states have a winner take all system, which gives all the electors a award to the winning presidential candidate.  After the presidential election the governor prepares a ""certificate of ascertainment"" listing the candidates who ran for president. The certificate of ascertainment declares the winning presidential candidate in my state will represent your state at the meeting of electors "
3887	Do you think that the FACE was created by aliens ? Well i think the face is just a land form but thats how i feel about it 
3888	I don't believe that aliens are real 
3889	On the other hand you might think they are real and i don't blame you because when i was little i thought they was real to ... by all of the movies i was watching about aliens taking over ect 
3890	Although , few scientists believed the face was an alien artifact photographing . 
3891	"So as it says in the article ""It's not easy to target Cydonia Mars Global Surveyor is a mapping spacecraft that normally looks straight down and scans the planet like a fax machine in narrow 2.5 km-wide strips we just don't pass over the face ver often.""  "
3892	I would have to go with electral college because better who would want a rich person voting last 
3893	To Start off with is why did i pick this, i pick this because the electoral college is a moving process full of educated students looking to make whats best out of what ever they have. ''the founding fathers established it in the constitution'' that students over 18 can vote 
3894	the cons of this is their still young a their still growing up I get that 
3895	So I think that people should stop driving so reckless and start paying attention to the road 
3896	If we have this policy i am going to be happy cause this a change to show our principal that we can do it without her telling us because we are older to know what's right from wrong. 
3897	That's all I have to say 
3898	In free time there isn't anything to do anyways.  What could go wrong, I mean it's only at lunch and during free time.  What's there to be called free time if you can't do what you want to do. 
3899	the con that could mostly impact america is a tie in the electoral vote. 
3900	with that being said with the presidents trying to run for president the will actually try to reach the peoples needs to meet there satisfactory. the swing states is sayiong that there one state isnt going to decide the whole election.Â  Â  Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â     
3901	you should have it's a easy compromise to vote. 
3902	 The electoral collage is good but not that good. The electoral collage has to choose the president and the vice president. That is not right 
3903	mr. ob dole was right that we should abolish the electoral collage. i beleive and it my oppion that this is not right but the candinates think so.  
3904	 Like On paragragh 18 the same thing happen with obama and romney to . obama received 61.7% for the elector vote compared to only51.3%.so the electoral collage should not be a constitution 
3905	because that if we let it keep on going then is will not be fair to anyone at all. And it also not fair for a winner tom take all.       Â     
3906	I know befor you were senator you voted just like us and you know how frustrating it can be somethings. 
3907	"A Face on Mars, or just a common mesa? Many skeptics belive that the mesa on Mars, located at 41 degrees north martian latitude, is proof of ancient alien civilazation. In 1976, when NASA's Viking 1 crossed over a landform that showed ""shadowy likeness"" of a human face. When NASA revealed the picture to the public, thinking it would be a good way to draw attention to Mars, caused an uproar. "
3908	I think you should let us students that have a  D  should play sports. 
3909	I think we should have more activities so everyone would come to school everyday 
3910	Students are going to be put under a lot of pressure if they have to keep up with school work and take school activities which could cause stress. Also students sometimes won't be able to keep up with all the work and activities after school. 
3911	this one looks more like like a face and the rest are just plane landforms 
3912	But if there was aliens On mare why would they just make one landform that looks like a face if there was aliens on mars im sure they wouldnt just make one that looks like a face and dont make anymore. They would make more and more till they got tired of making them 
3913	So I think maybe they could add them aslong as they make sure its as safe as possible. 
3914	so everyone has a say on who they want to be the state senate 
3915	It's ok to go for what you believe in. You might get judged but who cares it's your opinion don't listen to them. 
3916	I personally think that we should keep it. The Electoral college is widely regarded as an anachronism a non-democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be [overruled] by declaring the candidate who recieves the most popular votes the winner. 
3917	It's the electors that elect the president not the people. When your voting for a presidential candidate you're actually voting for a slate of electors. Each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee 
3918	It may have ripped some people off, 
3919	Big States 
3920	It can be argued but only one will be victorious. Will we keep the electoral vote? Or will we get rid of it? So if i persuaded you to keep it pick, then keep if i didnt, then pick get rid of it. Which one will you choose. 
3921	the Electoral College is process consists of the selection of the electors ,which the meeting of the electors where they vote for President and Vice President , and the counting of the electoral votes by congress. 
3922	They get to vote who is going to be but, the Electoral College is consists of the selection of five hundred thirty eight electors. The majority of two hundred seventhy electoral votes is requied to elect the president 
3923	I think that is not going to be alot of votes of people who is voting for the person who they want. Is just voters vote not for the president , but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president. Not always the voters can control whom their electors vote for! 
3924	These five reasons have something to deal with Electoral College. Is just some arguments that they have of electoral college, in of defense of the electoral college. 
3925	Driverless cars have a positive and negative aspect to them. 
3926	So, please take into consideration what I've said to you. 
3927	because i don't really care about any of this. But you wanted my opinion so i gave it to you. Also I say to stick with the electoral college is because i don't care enough to give a reason to change your voting to popular vote. I don't really knoe anything about the ellectoral college or populare vot, because you passage is to boring i couldn't get through half of it. 
3928	Ooh and if whoever is reading this or if your grading this be remind ed if this was getermining if I were to get out of entsive reading or not for next year i really wouyld try harder. Because we both know this isn't. And im cencerly sorry i havent prepared a better passage for you to read. But im pretty sure you don't read all of it. 
3929	The picture shows us a part of Mars where the face is just form in that weird way 
3930	Makin people think there was aliens on Mars. Mars is not a liveable place. There is no air to breathe, and it is to hot. You wouldn't make it alive in Mars, because you would lose your breath and burn up. 
3931	It is a great picture off landform you might never see again, but it has nothing to do with aliens on Mars. If aliens were real, one of  NASA'S scientists would have found them in outer space by now 
3932	You could open up another band class or give us study hall sense we don't have it or maybe make home base even longer. 
3933	Students should have the same rights as teachers or any adults. The constitution says that all people are created equal. That should give students the right to bring cell phones to school 
3934	These are the good and bad things about policy one.  This is why I have chosen policy one. 
3935	If there is no more Electoral college it would not be fair because we would not be able to vote for the president we desire. 
3936	Who knows who will become the president then! Not only will we not be able to vote for the president of the United States of America but we wont be able to vote for the vice president, governor, senates...  ETC  . That would not be fair, all that hard work and dedication that people put in to help the women stop sacrificing and vote and you all are going to put it to waste, you will not only dissapoint us but you will dissapoint the people who led women to vote 
3937	While most driverless cars require you to have hands on the wheel this does not mean you will be paying attention if somthing is about to happen. All it would take is for somthing in the car to mess up and people could be very seriously hurt. 
3938	That's why we should do it would help us on are school recorder. 
3939	It wouldn't be fair for the students that have a C. This idea will only be for the first semester.  In the second semester the students will have to have a B to participate 
3940	"NASA looked into this ""face"" a lot more. Me and my crew where up all night for days just digging deeper for more information! Finally, after days of reserch I got some feed back. I unveild the images of this thing for all to see "
3941	Reason 4.) It allows freedom. Some kids are rebellious. So, when someone tells them something, they go against it 
3942	Having a phone sometimes helps this situation.  
3943	but it is just be revised by that people that know what is best for the country. 
3944	But on april 5,1998 when mars global surveyor cydonia for the first time they shot photos of the pictures and they showed them.But they also investing in those pictures and rerally seen where they came from.But most people where not happy because the face of mars was located 41 degrees north martian latitude where it was winter in april 1996.But nevertheless on April 8, 2001 a cloudless summer day in cydona and it was 25 degrees to center the face of mars 
3945	but they can think what they want to think and so can I. 
3946	Finnaly,the last reason i think that we should not have that Electoral College is because it dont doing the people anything if we take it away 
3947	Most likely everthing will be a total disaster. If we change everything it will all fall under the pressure. We really dont need change in the world today as it is. It will be hard to get up after this big of a fall.  
3948	But on the other hand what is good about it is that it is widely regarded as an anachronism 
3949	It is a non-democratic method of selecting a president. But it is not a democratic in a modern sense. But it is good because the people vote for a trusted slate of electors. But the trusted electors vote for the party`s nominee. Even though the Electoral College has a lack of most everything. 
3950	Everyone has that one good argument. Everyone calls the Electoral College a disaster factor. 
3951	Also this thing can be argued. Well about changing and also maybe keeping the Electoral College. 
3952	Because there is some pro`s and con`s to this situation. There is going to be up`s and down`s when it comes to this topic. There might be many more to come in the near future. This topic is one topic that everyone is arguing about this day in time 
3953	Community service, you want children to do community service my opinion for that is they should in some way and in another they shouldn't . 
3954	Sometimes they need help so you should get involved and help out every once in awhile. 
3955	Opinion two in some way children should not help out 
3956	You have too think children need every minute of their life with education . This cant be during our time of learning that help us when we get older. Children shouldn't do community service not in till they get little bit older . Time is money and money is in our education to go to college and be successful in our everyday lives. 
3957	My point is think about what you put off make the right decision see where the children are if they have extra time they could it after school 
3958	In this essay im going to give you my opinion about the electoral college. 
3959	Secondly we dont get to vote for the president 
3960	lets just say u live in texas and wanted to vote for for john kerry youd vote for a slate of 34 democratic electors pledged to kerry. On the off chance that those electors won the state wide election,they would go to congress and kerry would get 34 electoral votes. Who are the electors? They can be anyone not holding public office. 
3961	This states that the cars are safe for only a period of time. An all computerized car is just asking for the worse when it gets older. 
3962	People are on the argument that NASA would hide an aliean artifact. NASA is trying to cover the possabilty of this artifact being accrute. That NASA would like to have this information to them selfs. The supporters of NASA beleve that NASA would come out with their discoverys. Both sides have a piont of but NASA starts their project to debunk these theorsist. 
3963	 NASA capters this photo of the red plant in the year 1976 and shows the photo to the public. 
3964	NASA knows that aliens are fake they just want people to think that they are real so they can get more money by spreding rummers that they found a UFO that has crashed in to the earth and the weriod crop cricles that are made into the corn fields, and they make money off of that crap, I think that is stuiped that they get money on that stuff and then there is other people that are trying to find money just to feed themselfs and there childern .  
3965	The face in mars is just a hugh rock that got hit by some comets and the comets hit in just the right places and they made a face in that rock all the other syuff around it got hit to by a comet to so that is why places near the rock are caved in they got hit by a comet. 
3966	When you vote along with everyong else i think that the majority of the votes should get that presedent instead of everyone voteing and then it getting sent to the electoral college and them getting to pick who they want wich i dont think is right i think that the people should pick who they want by the votes. 
3967	In columbia they are allocated 3 electors and treated like a state for purposes of the electoral college 
3968	The Electoral college is a place were they elect the presidant of the united states and the congress choose if they put a vote in for that presidant and his people. The process is the selection of electors next the meeting of the electors and then where would they vote for the presidant and the vice presidant and the counting of the electoral votes by congress the elctoral college consists of 538 electors and a majority of 270 electoral votes is required to vote for the presidant. The presidants election is held every four years on a tuesday after the first monday in November 
3969	"First off, I suggest that some states stop using the ""winner-takes-all"" system. "
3970	I think that process is outrageous. Do you really think this process is choosing the right person to run our country? Just because the Congress likes this system, doesn't mean we, the people of the United States, preferably enjoy it. 
3971	Sometimes people are wrong about other people. Each state only casts one vote, so we better make the best out of it, right? 
3972	Another reason is that this system helps choose which president will do the better for the United States. 
3973	Overall I think that this a bad process, and I think they should change this. 
3974	that's what i think about requiring community service. 
3975	Which would cause the student to get an even lower grade average! Unlike with an A or B student who would always at least try to complete their school work and homework. 
3976	which again would make them struggle in school even more. If the below B average student was actually worried about their below average gradethey would 
3977	plus it would save Cogress , senators , the President , and Vice President time and paper work 
3978	To begin with, I personally think the Electoral College should change because over the years after people voted it seemed they wanted to change it, 
3979	so they decide to cause a riot around there city, maybe the U.S. Some people do not like how the Electoral Law is set for our U.S. My opinion is that some of the people running for presidents usually get helped, not only by us, but by other members of the Electoral Collage. As you see the evidence is how you turn on the T.V at night and see what is going on with the vote and election. For example Afganiscan, they are destroying there country becuase of how much they dislike our president, because of a unfair vote. 
3980	Think about it would any of this happen if the Electoral College made things fair with making people at least vote twice? 
3981	As you see how other people are getting deeply hurt of what you are doing. Now am not asking you to abuse this opinion just to make people happy, but the main topic of what i am writing you is to think and observe around you. According to everyone else opinion, i am not only speaking for me now, but people are thinking to redo the election. People all country would like to vote for the same president of the U.S i know there are some states that have a president but like im saying, they want to change that. 
3982	People can see that its up to us to choose who is president, but its not the members of the Electoral College job to add more credit to the person losing or winning 
3983	People are dieciding to make plans because they do not get things there way. Just like the riot in paris with the terriots, there had to be a reseason for it. Think about it why would terriots want to kill people? Not only for fun but because of the presidential voting. Every bad thing on the U.S is mainly about voting. Just like people holding up signs on the street to change there election. 
3984	As you can see the Electoral College is really selfish. 
3985	They tend to pay more attensiion to themselves but not others. They do it for the money and the fact to usually get other people upset. The presidents that the Electoral Collage want to win they win. Its a fact that most presidents win to easy. They win with a plethora of help, not only with the U.S but with the members of the Electoral Collage. 
3986	In Conlusion, the electoral colage has to think about other people. They ned to focus more on the atmoshpere then sitting in one small room thinking about themselves.  
3987	The electoral college was established into the Constitution by our founding fathers as a compromise between election of the President by a vote in congress and election of the President by a popular vote of citizens. The electoral college consists of 538 electors. A majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the President. Wherever you live your states allotment of electors is equal to the number of members in its Congressional delegation. 
3988	Each canidate running for president has his/her own group of electors. The electors are usually chosen by the canidates political party. But each state has different laws. It depends on how the electors are selected and what their responsibilities are. The Presidental election is held every four years on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. Whenever you vote for whom ever you want to be President, you are also helping choose your states electors. Whenever you vote for your canidate you are actually voting for your canidates electors. 
3989	"Your governor prepares a ""Certificate of Ascertianment"" after the presidential election listing all of the canidates who ran for President in your state along with the names of their respective electors. Also, the certificate declares the winning of the presidential canidate in your state and it shows the electors that will represent your state at the meeting of electors in December of the election year. Your certificate is then sent to the Congress and the National Archoves as part of the official records of the presidential election. "
3990	the people, and the learning. If we did community service we would be a roll model for younger individuals and they would want to do community service as well and the cycle would keep repeating. 
3991	"Going in favor of Electoral College has only one good favor like in Source 1 it says that ""The Cerificate of Ascertainment also declares the winning presidential candidate in your state and shows which electors will represent oyur state at the meeting of the electors in Decemeber of the election year."" "
3992	"If there is a tie, then the should find one person off the streets and ask them who would they want to win the presidential election. All they would have to do is give him a piece of paper with both names and he would pick one. If the state went to popular votes then Obama and Romney would most likely had a closer race then what it was. In Source 2 it says ""According to a Gallup poll in 2000, taken shortly after Al Gore- thanks to the quirks of the electoral college- won the popular vote but lost the presidency, over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct electin to the kind we have know."" "
3993	They don't want election by popular vote cause they are afraid that a tie will happen because an election usually stops around 538 
3994	they also would notÂ learn the amount of information as they would in school. 
3995	Students would'nt benefit from being able to attend classes from home because students wouldnt learn the amount of information as they would in school 
3996	Home schooling shows us more about our future. Whoever thought that students would be able to take classes from home or even through video conferencing?  
3997	and the picture actually shows the Martian.  
3998	safe, 
3999	fuel-saving 
4000	In addition,the they're outcomes in the electoral college like in the year of 2012 an outcome happened. It happened when they were voting for Romney or Obama. Obama recieved a 61.7 percent of the electoral votes compared to 51.3 percent of the the popular votes for him and Romney. That happened when the number of votes possibly was 538 thats an even number of votes. 
4001	But having an even number is kind of good but it's higly an unlikely number. when that happens the state creates a landslide electoral vote victory the state.  
4002	Well i think that we should use phones but if anyone sees tell people to put there phone away. 
4003	I might tell people people that it is all right to be different and to not worry if you have to have a phone with you at all time and if not to aversive that we do not all need phones and to just be ok without phones. Just remember that some people may not even may not phones. Also be happy for what you have not what others have. I mean come to your senses that not all people are lucky for what they and some even want more then they want or need. Just remember what i said and take some advise and stick with people who need need more then we do .Iwant to help people when i grow up and show the time to care. i care a lot about people. 
4004	I reconsider that are principal should let us eight graders bring are cell phones to school and allow us to use them at all time except during class. 
4005	I think if are principle allow us to use are phones all eight grader will probably appreciated what the principle will let us do . 
4006	Yes it may look a alien or something out in space made it 
4007	but there is so much more proof you would need to prove it. Just think to your self how could you have proved that it was made by aliens? What proof do you have 
4008	Yes I do see why you or some people would get that it looks out of this world 
4009	With this new process in voting for the president called electoral college it would be a new start to voting history.''The electoral college avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate recieves a majority of the votes cast''. This would mean no candidates wins with more votes. With this new method of voting it can be critisized about selecting a president who cannot run this country. Both candidates running for president has either his or her own team of electors who all have there own unique job as a party. 
4010	But with this system it can cause problems with bugs, viruses, and etc. 
4011	People often ask whats wrong with the electoral college? ''Under the electoral college system,voters vote not for the president,but for a slate of electors,who in turn elect the president'' 
4012	Dispite the electoral college method voting is still possible. 
4013	The reason is that the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College is because it eceeds the presidents votes. Most states have a winner take all method to figure out who represents your state. It would work but it would be very different then our old presidentual voting. 
4014	if people like bullies and rude and discourteous people don't help then they should have the right to choose or decide what they want to weather its to help or to not help, 
4015	We are all equal through our freedon, tharefore we should be treated that way in every way. 
4016	This causing not alot of people to vote in larger states. 
4017	But at the end of the day, the people are nominating their president, they don't want others to do it for them. 
4018	Back then the the people didn't get treated equal it was the seperate race and that it was by state law. That during the electoral collegeit was unfair to other people but that did change when they change by voteing the president. In 2012 the people voted for obama it was 61.7 of the people who voted for the president and they compared it to rommey votes it was 51.3 that voted for him. its better to vote during the electoral college because the votes is mostly by gae 18 and above to vote. 
4019	back in 1960 segregationists in louisana legislature nearly secceeded in replacing the democratic electors 
4020	if the vote is a tie they move it would be thrown to the huse of representatives where the state delegations vote on the president.  
4021	I'll admit I'm lazy sometimes too. 
4022	I believe that having an Elecotral college vote helps the President have a greater chance of becoming elected. 
4023	It's not only about the President though. When you vote for a presidential candidate you're actually voting for a slate of electors. 
4024	Consider that state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors, and that those electors could always defy the will of the people.Â  
4025	Our government bases off what the people want but the Electoral College dosen't always base off what the people more than what the state wants itself. 
4026	Some people want the Electoral College because they think that they solve all the problems 
4027	yes i do think that people who are running for president and senate should have the right to have a chance to become something big, but in my perspective i think that peoiple who is known and well common to there state will be a better outcome to whatever they run for 
4028	its like for an example, we live in the Florida state , we've know a woderful and handsome man that helps around our state and town of plant city,Â  giving us more and devoring most of his time helping the enviroment and creating a diffrence. The man would have a greater chance of being nomitanted to being a president unlike the other man who only came out of his shell a year ago and have no idea what this man is capable of. Who will we have better trust on? 
4029	Say if we play sports we wouldn't have the time of day to it and if you make us do it on weekends kids might not show up or some might become upset with you. 
4030	you should let the kids pick or if they do it give the some extra credit 
4031	But if you do pick to make kids do community service I will understand 
4032	It does not make any sense to me how the president with the votes does not win the presidential election. The electoral college is unfair for all voters that vote. When you think of a vote and how it works you would think by the most one with the most votes wins cause that pretty much means that most of the people would rather have the most wins over the win that had less votes but more electoral votes. 
4033	The only reason why people vote for the poplar vote because the if there is tie between the electoral vote it goes to the popularity vote. 
4034	"The Electoral college is all high and mighty and is a process that consists of the selection of the electors. During the meeting of the electors, they discuss the presidents and vice presidents that are trying out for there 'role' in society. They also align the counting of the electoral votes by the Congress men. If you did not know Senator the Electoral College or as we call it ""EC"" consists of 538 electors in the so called 'pole'. A majority of those electors are 270 votes that are required to elect the President. There is one allotment for each member of the House of Representatives adding an extra 2 for your senators, like you! "
4035	Wait a second you don't know the rest of the story do you. Well now I understand why you wouldn't want them to just be another organization. Am I Right? 
4036	"""Winner Take All"" sound familiar to you. Maybe not but I am going to explain it anyway. The Winner Takes All System awards all electors to the winning presidential canidate. Except for the unlucky ones like Maine, and Nebraska they have something called the ""Proportional Representation"". All said and done the ""certificate of Ascertainment"" is introduced after the elction has partaken in. This lists all of the canidates who ran for President in your state choosen along with the names of there ""side kick"" the electors. This shows who will be in your country running for president and elector for the next 4 years until the next election. "
4037	I think students should be required to take a position on whether students should be required to perform community service 
4038	they can learn more better education by just being apart of something achieving in life as in doing their school work, getting good grades, being dedicated and representable to the respect in the school policy 
4039	i'm writing to you about the issues of the electoral voting process. 
4040	", The text asked itself a question ""Do citizens sometimes get confused and vote for the wrong canidate?"" And the answer was sometimes this process is to confusing for thed citizens to understand and it is not fair to use we have the right to vote but who are we voting for? What are we voting for? If we don't know who we are voting for then why vote. "
4041	Eventhough the text says is takes away the chance I still think it reduces it I mean look at the Bush family they did a horible job and guess who elected them the electors. 
4042	If weather or not students should or should not attend class from home by online video conferencing 
4043	The advocates of this position are correct in arguing that the electoral college method is not democractic in a modern sense.... it is the electors who elect the president, not the people. When tou vote for a presidential candidate you're actually voting for a slate of electors. 
4044	So you really cant trust if you are going to end up with the right president. Who is picking the electors anyway? Random people are going to vote for our president. Why should we trust them? 
4045	The whole system of electoral college is messed up 
4046	"because just the the election back in 2012 ""Obama's electorial vote was 61.7 and then the popular vote concluded with a 51.3, that doesnt seem fair no does it? "
4047	But what is the point of having your phone out, if you were walking and texting you get walk into somebody and get hurt walking into something like a wall 
4048	Second of all, you should pick to keep the Electoral College because it helps people vote. 
4049	If it wasnt for electors you probably wouldnt be picking a President or none of that because the electors set it all up. The Electoral College tells you where the meeting is to vote. The Electoral College has 538 electors and there has to be a majority of 270 electoral votes to elect a president. So there is no reason not to pick to keep the Electoral College.  
4050	So he left with no votes and would have to find his Electoral College votes in a more suitable area. 
4051	In Conclusion I think that the we should keep Electoral Colleges and changing to election by popular voting to vote for a President.   
4052	I would try to do better in school so I would be able to play sports. 
4053	When I get a good grade on my test and it is above 76 I am so happy that  I got a good grade on a test.  The reason I try to make good grades so I can go an stay at my friends house that is another reason I try to make good grades.  Another reason I like to keep my grades up is to be able to go to my moms house and that is one of my favorite places to go and stay. The other reasons I like to keep my grades up is so I don't get intruble so I do not have to do so much at the house and not being able to go fishing with my dad and that is another reason I like to get good grades. Another reason I like to get my grades up is so I can get to go to college. 
4054	When ever a president gets elected in the United States of America, the votes that they recieve are from the electoral college process. The electoral college has 538 electors, each state in the United States of America has a certain amount of voters, one state might have more than others. For example, The state of California and Texas have the most votes throughout the whole country.  
4055	Some people don't really agree with the electoral college process because they belive that if you vote you are voting for electors of your state that eventually vote for you at the end 
4056	Time has nothing to do with this way of voting, nothing at all. But maybe we should see some changes in the way we elect a president. 
4057	"""we the people"" is what our country is based off of and by having the electoral colloge set in place we cannot be the people. We are endowed certain rights and freedoms by the government and getting a vote is one of them but with this electoral college propaganda we cannot not give our sincere vote that counts. "
4058	Much like taking this test we are waisting our time. We are endowed by our creator certain unalianable rights that cannot be taken away. There is a lot wrong about our government and elecoral college doesnt strike the surface. It is foolish to think electoral college is the biggest problem america has. Not just america but the world. The world is falling apart and all these hypocritical media people are freaking out over the electoral college. 
4059	"Riches on earth mean nothing. Moth, famine, and thieves destroy here. But riches in heaven is what matters. This country would never even have became independent if it was run by the people who are running it now. First of all this country was founded on God and now the government wont even allow us to have a Christmas party in schools because the word CHRIST is in it. They want us to have a ""holiday"" party instead. they will all see one day. On judgment day. All we can do is pray for them because thats all that can help these distranged men. Love Joy Peace Patience Kindness Goodness Faithfullness Gentleness and Self-control ol ol. Love joy peace patience kindness goodness faithfulness gentleness and self-contol o ol. "
4060	because the only way that I would do that one is if all of the kids in the school get on there phones in the middle of class and just stay on it for the whole time without doing anything else without even paying attention to anyone or anything else. But policy one is more understanding because it is getting phones out of the way while they are working but not while they are on there free time because phones shouldn't bother anyone if its on there free spare time 
4061	But that is my reasen why i would go with policy one. 
4062	I have heard that many students are arguing on whether community service should be done by the students and i just wanted to share my opinions with you to help your decision. 
4063	To begin with, The Electoral College is a process. 
4064	that we don't have segergation in the state. 
4065	Next, we dont want segregation in the state 
4066	it casually states that,'' segregationists in te louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in the replacing the democratic electors with new electors that oppose of a Jhon kenndy'', If that have happened then we would be in chaos everyone would be aginst each other and there will be alot of pain and suffering for the people because of there race,and religous belife we would no longer be a great nation. 
4067	Driverless cars are becoming more popular in today's society. 
4068	You are about to make a deciding between whether to make your student.  Perform community service . to whatever decision you make you will always have your good and bad reaction. So know whatever you pick people going have a opinion. Now i am going give to difference reason on both sides.  
4069	"It also states that ""This year voters can expect another close election in which the popular vote winner could again lose the presidancy."" This show how the elections are in a way screwed up because they already in a way know how many votes a certain person is going to get and how many votes the other person is going to get. "
4070	They practicly alredy know who is going to win the election before the voting even begins because the board already has it all planned out. 
4071	The consequences should be very big for being on a cell phone or let alone bringing a cell phone to school. Students should at least have a detention or even an in school suspension. Students need to know their boundaries and what happens when they cross them. Discipline is a great way to turn students off their cell phones 
4072	My second paragraph is , what I think is if schools offer classes online and/or video conferencing , to the students that means that they really want to help students when they dont attent to school 
4073	For instance ; that schools are really good they need to help all students that they need some help , if they offer that classes online is because they want all the students to work hard every single day at home or anywhere, they wanted to work on those classes online , and if you take classes online you can take notes to help you when you have to take a quiz about what you read and what you know. 
4074	If students deside to go school , they can take all the classes that they want to take 
4075	They can take in the school were they went but;Â if they don't want to take classes online its does't matter what they want to do if they work from home by the way online , they can work in the school if they want or at home if they wanted to work really hard without any reason and if you get good grades on that classes and you understand everything you can pass that classes. 
4076	For example , if you at home don't have any internet , what you can do is if you want classes online you can go to the library and work on those classes there , you are not going to pay nothing if you work on that classes , they give you free that classes that's why the school's give you that option to you and for all the student's if you are a smart student and you study really hard , you can finish that clases in less than a moth but if you study hard every day at home or at school that can help you.Â Â   
4077	People are lazy to do community service. Because they just wanna chill around with they're friends and they don't do they're homework. I do my homework every Friday I don't like doing it Saturdays or Sundays. I always get lazy or I go and chill with my friends. My mom doesn't like me being in the house locked so she lets me go outside and chill with my friends or I go with her to go shopping to the mall or we go to my brother house. I use to like being locked now I don't cause my head starts to hurt I feel like if I was in jail 
4078	"The only reason why we build cars and buses and trains and etc is to make us get to things like a if your running late for something and you need to get there really fast you could take your car and get there as fast as you can so your not offically late and not get fired and have to lose your job cause you were late for work.  That's why we have cars to rely on and not our feet the whole time but most times if we dont want to use our car we can always walk there thats somewhere close and not far to walk like the gas station or the park or anything or if your just to dang ""LAZY"" to even walk that far then you would use a car or if you dont own a car you always use the bus to go where you want to go. It's not that hard to spend a little money on a bus toll to get to where you want to go and really it's not that hard at all but if it's for something really important then ""GO BUY A CAR"" i mean yeah cars are exspenive to even afford one but really if you save money then wouldn't have no problem at all on buying a car that has to fit your needs and get to places that you need to go. "
4079	First of all we could give a message to every one of the non caring students at school but they just won't listen to an announcement said by a teacher. 
4080	That is why we must take action into our own hands to give the students at this school of learning an understanding of why we should stop littering. This school is already dirty why make it dirtier than it was before 
4081	There are many natural landforms on the moon, but no one says there is aliens living on the moon. 
4082	But one the other hand, there saying that they might change it to the election of the popular votes of the president of the United States. I think they should keep using the electoral college because it actually have better benefits or outcomes because you know who you voted for and from what they told you 
4083	"you believe they can make it happen. There's some states that have a ""winner-take-all"" system that awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate. "
4084	But the bad side about the electoral college is that what happens if thr president you like is a republican but you like the democratic senator? Well i dont know what your going to do then because going to be a problem. 
4085	in the election of 2012 Barack Obama received 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to only 51.3 percent of the popular votes cast for him and Mitt Romney 
4086	If our president isn't chosen by the citizens of the united states then the person that was chosen by unfair terms and bias choices isn't really the president of the united states; but is truly the president of the men and/or women in the electoral college who chose he or she. 
4087	Some of the smaller states don't get to see any campaign ads like the larger states do so they are basically putting the fate of the presidency in the hands of a few swing voters. 
4088	"I can understand why other people may think my claim is wrong, but everyone is entitled to their own opinion, and should also be entitled to their own vote aswell which is why instead of voteing for someone who will vote for our president [  we  ] the people should directly vote for our candidates. In the same article""  The Indfensible Electoral Colledge"" "
4089	"The Electoral College is a system use for citizens to pick who they would like to make and force the laws. ""The Electoral College process consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for President and Vice President, and the counting of the electoral votes by Congess.""- Source 1. It's many steps to picking a president. You have to pick candidates and those candidates have their share of electors, which are chosen by a political party under certain qualifications. ""The electors are generally chosen by the candidate's political party, but state laws on how the electors are selected and what their responsibilities are . . . ."" "
4090	"You help choose your state's electors when you vote for President because when you vote for your candidate you are actually voting for your candidates's electors."" "
4091	"""Voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a political prefereance rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election. . . ."" "
4092	but if this is not a face what is it? That's what your thiniking right. We had to find out 
4093	for those who do not know what a mesa is a mesa is kind of like a landform made by dirt been blown by the wind. 
4094	"Well ""on a cloudless summer day in Cydonia----Mar Global Surveyor drew close enough for a second look.""we had to roll the space craft 25 degrees to center the Face in the field of view"" Said Garvin. ""Malin's team captured and extraordinary photo using the cameras absoulute maximum resolution."" Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 viking photo"". "
4095	Many companies and people still belive that it is a face but, finally we have the truth! 
4096	If the eclectoral college leads to a tie our votes become the tie braker but that method has never been use so why are we even voting? 
4097	"When something is non-democratic, it means that it is not in the democrats favor. It is a rap for them, its already set for the Republicans to win. Stated in the passage, ""In a modern sense . . . it is the electors who elect the president, not the people. When you vote for presidential candidate you're actually voting for a slate of electors."" Democrats may cast in their vote for presidential candiate comes with a group of electors, they see the electoral college as favorable towards the Republican group. "
4098	"Stated in the passage ""Election would be thrown to the House of Representatives, where delegations vote on the president."" Us people, us as citizens would not even be in charge or have a say so in who runs our country. We would not even have a choice or chance to vote and see who is worthy and most honorable in our eyes to be our president. Some may be lucky on the Representative choices on who the Electors and our Presidents would be, but also some may be dissatisified. The favor will only be in the representaives place. And the odds will be onto us. The Electoral College is not ran by the Representatives. We have a say so. "
4099	beacuse For one theres alot of electors like around 538. A majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the president. Then after the presidental election , your governor prepares a 'Certificate of Ascertainment ' listing all of the candidates who ran for president in your state along with the names of their respective electors. 
4100	" To begin with under the 23rd amendment of the constitution ,""The District of Columbia is allocated 3 electors and treated like a state for purposes of the electoral college"" and for that saying , in theÂ  following discussion , theÂ  word state also refers to the district of columbia. Also Each and every candidate that is running for president in your state has his or her own group of electors.""The electors are generally chosen by the candidate's political party , but state laws vary on how the electors are selected and what their responsibilities are.""  Foremost , under the electoral college system , voters vote not for the persident , but for a slate of electors , who in turn elect the president.""Who are the electors? They can be anyone not holding public office. Who picks the electors in theÂ  first place? it depends on the state. Now i understand sometimes at state conventions , Partys , central committee , sometimes the presidental candidates themselves , Also sometimes get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate.""The single best argument against the electoral college is what we might call the electoral college is what we might call theÂ  disaster factor. Its Basically whenever theres aÂ  really good argument thats what its called.  Subconstantquintly , Sometimes most people worry about the prospect of a tie in the elections vote. ""In That case , the election would be thrown to the house of representatives , where state delegations vote on the president."" At the most basic level , the electoral college is unfair to voters. ""because of the winner-take-all system in each state , candidates dont spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning , focusing only on the tight races in the ""swing"" states. Then now its official "" The electoral college is unfair , outdated , and irrational."" The best arguments in favor of it in favor of it are mostly assertions without much basis in reality.  "
4101	To end with , Thats why you should keep the electoral college because ,Â  You should keep the electoral college , beacuse For one theres alot of electors like around 538. A majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the president. Then after the presidental election , your governor prepares a 'Certificate of Ascertainment ' listing all of the candidates who ran for president in your state along with the names of their respective electors.      
4102	This is true with states particularly in the North who are made up of mostly Democratic and the South being mainly Republican. After the decisions made by the current president Obama, I think many Democratics will want to try something different after seeing all that has not been accomplished under Obama as of 2015. 
4103	I hope Senator, you will take into consideration my statement.  
4104	Students should turn cell phones off in any hour of the day in which the are learning. If caught with phone on or still having the same texting conversations as lunch or previous periods then a proper form of punishment should be given. The reasons young adults should be given the choice to bring or not to bring their phones is because they need to know if you make a choice and get in trouble that they need to take the punishment. 
4105	Policy 2 is an unfair unlike Policy 1 which give us a choice. 
4106	Policy 2 is like taking an agenda from a hard working lawyer or doctor. It is something they need to make through the day just as young adults need their phones. 
4107	"Now the phone usage on the bus is the same policy as the school. They always have those ""NO CELL PHONE USAGE"" signs up. "
4108	Would students benefit from being able to attend classes from home?  yes and no 
4109	''Abolishing the electoral college! They're not alone; according to a Gallup poll in 2000, taken shortly after al gore-thanks to the quirks of the electoral college-won the popular vote but lost the presidency , over 60Â  porcent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now. 
4110	the dirent argument in united states '' the single best argument against the electoral college is what we might call the disaster factor'' te united staste have diferent forms the using electoral college sometimes state conventions, sometimes the state party's central committee, sometimes the presidential candidares themselves.''the senate would choose the vice-president. the diferent senator's popular did diferences electoral college in parts of the united states. example : ''Nixon, Jimmy carter, bob Dole, the U.S camber of commerce, and the AFL-Cio all.'' 
4111	"One example ''republicans in california. knowing their vote will have no effect , they have less incentive to pay attention to the campaigh than they would have if the president were picked by popular vote.... but of course no voter's vote swings a national election, and in spite of that, about one-half the eligible American population did nvote in (2012)election''. In electoral consist in vote that person going is necessary much candidate for fine electoral college "" the electoral college consts of 538 electors.

4112	The electoral collage is ver important in big responsability for status. 
4113	""" After the presidential election, your governor a 'certificate' of scertainment' listing all of the candidates who ran for president in your state along with the names of their respective electors."" the responsability the electoral college is better status. the candidate is going election and promosion for going electives'' However, maine and Nebraska each have a variation of '' proprotional representation..'' "
4114	In conclusion, the text electoral college is import for status. The electoral college is big method of selcting that using very good for election in candidate and president and diferent causes no required. In the electoral college requires president and candidates for diferent region. So region have president or candidate that proportion benefic and help for person much through 
4115	Some people might not follow that policy but it would sure help out a lot. 
4116	"One of the great things Electoral College brings that it is widely regarded as anarchronism with means that the votes wont be ""overruled"" it would acutally be the maguraty of the people voting on the president. If not it would be the elctors who elect the president, not the people. "
4117	There have been a lot of cases in the past that go against Electoral College 
4118	but there should not be bullies in your school in the first place 
4119	The electoral college makes sure that no canidate recieves a maajority of the votes cast 
4120	If it wasnt for the electoral college then half of the people like democrats of texas and republicans in california wouldnt vote because their votes dont count. 
4121	A dispute over an outcome is possible but not certain that you would win. But on the other hand a dispute over the popular vote is more likely to win. 
4122	"Google has had cars that could drive independently under specific conditions since 2009. Their cars had driven more than half a miliion miles without a crash.  In 2013, BMW announced the devolopment of ""Traffic Jam Assistant."" the car can handle driving functions at speeds up tp 25 mph, but special touch sensors make sure the driver keeps hold of the wheel. They can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills ,such as navigating through work zones and around accidents. This means the human driver must remain alert and be ready to take over when the situations requires. This necessitates the car being ready to quickly get the drivers attention whenever a problem occurs.  GM has devoloped driver's seats that vibrate when the vehicle is in danger of backing into an object. The google car simply announces when the driver should be prepared to take over. Other options under considerartions are flashing lights on the windshield and other heads-up displays. Manufacturers are also considering using cameras to watch that drivers are remaining focused on the road. While the driver watches the road, the car watches the driver.  Tesla has a projected a 2016 release for a car capable of driving on autopilot 90 percent of the time. In 2020 the cars that would be able to drive by themself are Mercedes-Benz, Audi, and Nissan. "
4123	The electoral college is a part of the constitution, it's has been used to decide who will be our president froever as long as the constitution has been on paper. Why get rid of it? Is it because we live in a world where everything is new and improved? Or because it geneuinly does'nt work? Electoral colleges are widely regaurded as an anachronism, and non-democratic method of selecting a president. 
4124	So why do we need to cange the way we do things. 
4125	What if something tlike the disaster factor happened again and someone voted for someone that wasnt in their party. Or if an election came to a tie what would happen then the election would be thrown to the house of representitives, where the state delegations vote on the president, because each state casts only one vote ,the single representitive from wyoming, represents 500,000 voters. but the electoral college avoide run-off elections meaning no canidate recieves a majority of the votes cast. 
4126	because its not 
4127	Is community service for the help of people or to punish the bad by .What they have done in the past of their life . 
4128	Has your principal ever required community service for your school .Well if you were ever in that place .Would you do it or pass it by? Its always a question in mind.      
4129	they didn't any thing bad i think only the bad people should do community service they do something bad they have to make it up for you but like that is up to you i am telling you what is on my mind of people want to help they can help but not all kids should do it 
4130	Thank you for your consideration, 
4131	I THINK THAT PEOPLE IN THIS SHOULD HELP THE COUNTRY ON DOING THE RIGHT THINGS LIKE DOING RECYCLING. PICKING UP TRASH. 
4132	CAUSE I THINK THAT STUDENTS SHOULD GET TOGETHER IN HELP OUR SCHOOL BY DOING WORK. 
4133	BEING THE PERSON WHO CLEAN THE COUNTRY BY PICKING THERE TRASH UP IN TAKING THERE TRASH OUT. 
4134	AND THINK THAT SHOULD NOT DO COMMUNITY SERVICE 
4135	CAUSE THATS TAKING AWAY THE EDUCATIONAL THINGS THEY HAVE TO DO 
4136	LIKE ME I WOULD LIKE TO 
4137	IN I KNOW I WOULD TRY TO HELP THE SCHOOL TO GET THINGS TOGETHER AND I KNOW I CLEAN MY ROOM AND DO THINGS FOR MY MOTHER. AND A MOST EVERY DAY I CLEAN THE FRONT YARD AND THE BACK YARD IF IT DIRTY OR LITTLE BIT MESSES. 
4138	But then there or those kids who don't want do anything because their lazy or cause they have disability's 
4139	I also think that for the students who don't want to continue community and service can have consequences here back at school or they either keep going with the other students. 
4140	since we never got to do it in elementary besides help wash the dishes in the cafeteria in elementary school, so it's fun here. 
4141	those may be boring, nasty etc, but just always know you're doing something by helping your community. 
4142	Source 1; What is the electoral collage?  The electoral collage is a process, not a place. The electoral collage process consists of the selection of the meeting of the electors where they vote for president and vice president and the counting of the electoral of the electoral votes by congress. The electoral collage consists of 538 electors. A majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the president. The Congressional delegation one for each member in the house of representives plus two for senators. The 23rd Amendment of the constiton the district of columbia is allocated 3 electors and treated like a state for purposes of the electoral collage. Each candiddate running for president in your state has his or her own group of electors. The electors are generally chosen by the candidate's political party but state has his or her own group of electors. The electors are chosen by political party. The state law vary on how the electors are selected and their responsibilities. The presindential election are held every four years. After the president election the governor prepares a Certifiate of Ascertainment.  Source 2; The indefensible electoral college; why even the best laid defenses of the system are wrong.  Under the electoral collage system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors who in turn elect the president. If you live in Texas and vote for a slate of 34 Democratic electores pledged to kerry would get 34 electoral votes. On the off-chance that those electora won the statewide election they would go to Congress and Kerry would get 34 votes. The single best argument against the electoral collage is what we might call the disaster factor. The American people are lucky that 2000 fiasco was the biggest eleection crsis in a century. Back in 1960 segregationists in the Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with the new electors who would oppose John F Kenney. He was a great learder.  Source 3; in dedense of the electoral college; five reasons the keep out despised method of choosing the president.  The number collage is widely regared as an anachronism a non- democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be overruled. The advocates of this position are correct in arguing that the electoral college method is not democrtic in a modern sense. When you vote for a president candidate you're actually voting for a slate of electors. There are five reasons for reatining the Elctoral college despite its lack of democratic pedigree all are practical reason not liberal or conservative reason. In 2012 election for example Obama received 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to only 51.3 percent of the popular votes. The electoral college requires a president candidate to have trans- regional appeal. The winner takes all method of awarding electoral votes induces the candidates as we saw in 2012 election to focus their campagign efforts on the toss up states. 
4143	After many years of no one has changed anything else about the election camagign or anything. I think its time to do that. Lets put a girl in the office she can do just as good as a men. 
4144	I think the students would listen to him he is a nice principal. 
4145	"This shows that this great ""system"" is starting to fall Apart. "
4146	this system makes congress think about its nominations for president 
4147	for example the article said the electoral college consists of the selection for the electors this means congress hs some time to meet and think in wich to vote. the passage said the electoral college consists of 538 electors so this means they got to reach a consensus and with a concensus everything is put to tghought so the bad things of each candatite is put to tgought. 
4148	The electoral college is not a place to be harmeed its a process. Therer a amendment of the the electrol college and it is amendment 23rd. 
4149	it is a good place to learn about the presudents. 
4150	We deserv this dont let walk away from us. 
4151	most people runing for presudent has there own group of electors. it is chosen by the candidate's. 
4152	you do not have the right to take ower electoral college. most of use wont this out of all of use 1 person did not vote. 
4153	The presidentaial election is held every four years on tuesday after the first monday in november. when you vote for presudent you help to choose your state electors. most state have winner take all that gets a prise for the winning presudent. which is why we need to keep ower electoral college. 
4154	We have a right to vote we can help choose state electoral. 
4155	The electoral college consists of 538 electoral. The amendment 23rd gives us ower rights. 
4156	we can vote you cant take away awereÂ  electoral college let us be. We can do nwhat we wont we can vote just like others have before.       Â        Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â   
4157	Driverless cars may be modern and use half of what todays taxis use . Yet they are not truly driverless, they still alert the driver to take over in certain conditions , for example pulling in and out of drive ways or driving through road work or accidents. Which brought them to the idea of embedding streets with an electrical cable that sends radio signals to a reciever on the front and end of the car , which is stated in the passage. These smart road systems worked well but require massive upgrades to existiing roads , which is simply too expensive. So with out the smart roads a whole lot of sensors are needed on the car , one specific sensor is the special touch sensor which makes sure that the driver keeps their hands on the wheel at all times . Besides that there is also seats that viberate to alert the driver and flashing lights on the window shields , which would add on to the price of a car. Also stated in the passage that so far none of the cars are completely driverless. They can steer , accelerate and brake themselves but they still notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills . This means the human driver must be alert and ready to take over at all time. Which might not always happen , a driver may not always be attentive of the road ahead even with alerts included in the car. Which brings up the case of a drivers, passengers , and pedestrians saftey , and lawmakers know that saftey is best achieved with alert drivers , which is stated in the passage. Traffic laws are written with the assumption that the only safe car has a human driver in control at all times. Infering to why in most states it is illegal even to test computer driven cars. Yet even if traffic laws change , new laws willl be needed in order to cover liability in the case of an accident. If an accident were to occur due to the technology failing , who is to blame the driver or the manufacturer. 
4158	not due what they are spouse to due. 
4159	so the electors can be anyone not holding public office. the state picks on the electors and sometimes state conventions and state partys central committe and the presidental candidates themselves. soÂ  what i am saying is that if change to popular voteÂ  it willshare the candidate share of the electoral college and invariably eceeds his share of the popular vote. 
4160	there are five reasons for retaining the electoral college despite its lack of democratic pedigree and all are paractical reasons are not liberal or conservative reasons.    Â  
4161	even if the state has a huge populationÂ  than other states . they equal out the vote of thepopulations so that every one could have an equal chance. 
4162	"Every one has part in the election during Electoral College , no one is left out like popular voting ways. From ""source 3: in defense of the electoral college :five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the president"" by richard A. Posner. "
4163	Even after proven wrong, people are still thinking that the face on mars is an actual alien made face. 
4164	In paragraph 10 it staes that on April 5th 1998 a global surveyor flew over Cydonia with a camera 10 times sharper than the photo taken in the original 1976 picture, shown to prove that on this picture the closer up it looks less like a face. But this wasn't the end of the research. 
4165	"Just like the belief in wether or not earth and people were made by god or science. They're both theories that's why people have to have ""faith"" in what they believe. The Big Bang theory for example is a theory because it doesn't have enough evidence to be proven that it legitimately happened. It goes the same with religion. "
4166	The face on mars was a pictures that the vikings took from 1976. When vikings were snapping pictures of possible landing sites for its sister ship viking two. So we already know that there were pepole on mars before so they might of built the face on mars. 
4167	Mission controllers had to be preparede to look agian. Then gavin said ''its not going to be a easy to target cydonia''. Althoght that few sientiste belived the face on marswas an alien artifact pictures became a priority for Nasa. 
4168	Some people might thing that aliens made the face on mars he it is why aliens did not make the face on mars 
4169	When the viking took the picture it was 1.56 meters and when the vikings were not around no more Nasa took the picture again and it was 43 meters per pixel. 
4170	The face of mars has become very populer icon it was in hollywood film on books and magazines and also radios and grocery stores. Some people wanted to defenders of Nasabudget wish that a ancient civilzation on mars to destory the faces of mars. Few days later Nasa recived a image for all to see the caption noted a rock formation that resembles the humans head. Nasa wanted to do a surprise amoung missions controllers back at the jet propulsion lab when the face was appered on their jets propulsion lab. When Nasa got the pictures they said that about the same height as the face on mars. Whe they got a rule of tumb you could discern things in a digital image three times bigger then the pixel size. 
4171	So i thing about what i told you you can know say that aliens did not create the face on mars. 
4172	why should such a small number mean more against the millions from the citizens of this great country, the same people that make up the great state of Florida. 
4173	Its said to be in pur decleration as part of the 23rd amendment. For so the district of Columbia is allocated 3 elctors but only for the electoral college. With saying we vote every 4 years on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. When a citizan votes for their candidate choice they are also voting for the candidate's electors. 
4174	"""Face on Mars could'nt of possibly been evidence of life on mars because, why would there be a face but no body to go along with it "
4175	Also, If NASA had dicovered something as amazing as life on Mars they would be happy to let the world know. The only reason to believe there is life on Mars is the natraul landform other than that there is no reason to believe. In conclusion, I do not believe that the ''face on Mars'' is proof of life. I also feel that the natrual landform is the only reason people believe that it is. 
4176	I STUDENT_NAME has had it with the principal 
4177	but you just need to calm you nerves a bit and stop getting so worked up and stuff i know this isn't a nice letter to you but how else would you understand or do you understand 
4178	Community service is such an amazing thing. It really shows how much America has grown. 
4179	We should try this for a year and see if it could possibly catch on then start circulating our ideas throughout the States. 
4180	everybody agrees with him/her 
4181	We also want a president that appeals to everyone not just one region of the United States. We want to have a president that gets things done like Obama has because we are in a lot of debt. 
4182	I think we should keep our method of choosing our state president 
4183	Another reason we should keep the college method is because it wouldnt take that long. 
4184	All we really just have to do is vote and in no time our president will be in office. 
4185	in conclusion I think we should keep the college method because its less time consuming and its an easier process.    
4186	The process of the Electoral College consists of a meeting of five hundred-thirty eight selected electors, where they vote for the President and Vice President 
4187	Yes kids bring phones to school when they are not suppose to but not all of them use it during class. They only bring there phones for when school is over and if they need to call there mom or dad. I only bring my phone so that if something bad were to happening after school when i am walking home or if i need to call for a question i have my cell phone. I have never used my phone during school because it is going to get me off task. 
4188	In my honest opinion I dont even think that we should have a President. Presidents dont do anything other than make things worst for our country. 
4189	What they do is maybe fix one or two things that the previous president did wrong but they add more problems for each president to fix so instead of trying to add more problems to us just dont do the job and give work to the government because obviously the government has enough time to make up lies and excuses on why things happen when instead the government themselves can do it, that way no excuses have to be made up. 
4190	It may not be my place to talk about the government at all because I dont know what they are talking about but honestly thats not the point, the point is that Americans are too dumb to realize when the Government is lying or even telling the truth 
4191	because they can never hear the real truth everything is the truth to them but if you deep and deep and deep youll find more and more things that to get suspious and you question yourself but youll never get to know the REAL truth because our government is corrupted and they lie to us Americans every time there is misery.    
4192	Transportation or cars will always have an huge impact on the economy. Think about how many people use cars today. 
4193	Everyone should have an opinion on what they think is right. 
4194	For example, if people say they want a democracy, that tells them that they want the right to speak for themselves. They want the freedom of speech that they deserve.  
4195	but you can just simply make a rule that if you do use them in class you will have to buy a new one or something 
4196	After school at least 3 times a week we can help a family or person in need. 
4197	dear state senitor I humbaly suggest that you don't turn from electoral college 
4198	cause there are many people who depend on that college as a electoral support.  
4199	You may think that we dont need the electoral college 
4200	but we do need the college because we also vote there and ifÂ  we dont then we do other important stuff there. 
4201	so inconclusion changing the college to a popular vote could be a bad thing to do 
4202	The American people should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century,the system allows for much worse. Back in 1960, segregationists in the Lousisiana legislature nearly succeded inÂ  replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy. 
4203	Its official: the electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. So the United states will not being the Electoral college 
4204	"Plus the ""face"" has changed alot from 1976 to 2001 "
4205	The spacecraft circling the planet would've caught an alien near by 
4206	"Also it looked alot more like a face in 1976 because the landform is changing and moving so the ""face"" moves and changes with it. "
4207	So far we haven't had any proof of aliens ethier. 
4208	"I believe if aliens were real we would find some by now cause we have spacecrafts around certain planets and we've been to the moon and still nothing. Maybe in the future we could find aliens but not now and it's been a while since the ""face"" has been created and we have no proof of aliens and we didn't back then ethier. "
4209	Now you see why you shouldn't change the average levels. It could make a huge difference in the students and there love for the school.  
4210	Even though NASA and it's supporters said they would have wanted it to be alien. 
4211	Some people still believe NASA is and was hiding something, but we may never know. 
4212	In the arcticle Driverless cars we are told about how cars are evolving are humans are needed much less they they are now to drive a car.  
4213	well we can make our cars look good but we dont need things like parkiing assistance or driving assistance, or ever assistance on car repairs.  cars should just stay the same we dont need all of this fancy stuff just to drive a car.  Driverless cars are not really needed that much becouse people are still learning how to drive, or they are older adults and they already know how to drive. 
4214	Taking away the electoral college would be like taking away an important part of our U.S history 
4215	With the electoral college there would be more discussion on the topic of making smart descions to electing a president 
4216	Not only does it keep the popularity vote out of check 
4217	If they used the popularity vote? We would go insane. If the people realize whatÂ  they are talking about, we could go billions of dollars out of our debt hole were in.. 
4218	"Our spending habits these presidents we have had over the past years have lead us into doing? Im surprised were all still alive honestly. Different candidates have different ways of planning their lives in office, their daily commutes, their daily functions, what laws they are going to put into place next, the next time that they will make a public apperence, those kind of things. But when theyre talking about taking electoral college out of play because its ""outdated"" personally I would say throw them a box of loony toon cereal. "
4219	Expecially now that we have so many of our constetutional rights going out of play and being laid to rest for the manyÂ  years that they helped serve us justice and made us actually realize our country went to war to fight for our freedom, thats basically taking away our freedom to have who we think is best in office. Everybody talks about both candidates. 
4220	"it says in paragraph 10 source 2 ""under the electoral college system,voters vote not for the president,but for a state electors.who in turn elect the president"". "
4221	Today I want to talk to you about some little problem that's not going as well as I thought it was going to go. 
4222	The Electoral College consists of 583 electors. A majority of 270 electoral vote is required to elect the President.  The presidential election is held every four years on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. 
4223	Us citizens think that's a better idea. Don't you think? 
4224	"The presidential election most have a ""winner-take-all"" system that awards all electors to the winning presidental candidate. And after the presidential election, yout governor prepares a ""Certificate of Ascertainment"". Listing all of the candidates who ran for President in your state along with the names of their respective electors. The electors are generally chosen by the candidate's political party.  According to Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole they agreed on abolishing the electoral college . The electoral college won the popular vote but lost the presidency over 60% of voters. What that means? 60% of the people didn't agree with the electoral college. The single best argument against the electoral college is what they might call the disaster factor. Us the American people should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco wasÂ  the biggest election crisis in a century. The state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors , and that those electors could always defy the will of the people.  At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winner-take-all system in each states they know they have no chance of winning , focosing only on the tight races on the ""swing"" states. During the 2000 compaign seventeen states did not see the canditates at all. Including Rhode Island and South Carolina. AlsoÂ  voters in 25 of the lqrgest media markets didn't get to see a single campaign ad. The electoral college is unfair, outdated , and irrational. The best arguments in favor of it are mostly assertionw without much basis in reality. Bob Dole was right. Abolish the elctoral college!  In conclusion, The Electoral College is widely regarded as an anachronism , a non-democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be overruled by declaring the candidate who receives the most popular votes the winner. There are five reasons for retaining the Electoral College despite its lack of democratic pedigtee; all are practical reasons, not liberal or conservative reasons. "
4225	That is what i think about everybody doing some community service around here.      
4226	after relason the picture it was a pop icon back then 
4227	While this source claims that ignoring biased parts of the population, this is quite far from the truth 
4228	Its better because the Electoral College consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for Presdident and Vice President, and the counting of the electoral votes by Congress 
4229	The Electoral College consists of 538 electors. Each candidate running for President in your state has his or her own group of electors. 
4230	The Electoral College is really a progress 
4231	when you vote for your candidate you are actually voting for your candidate's electors. They are generally chosen by the candidate's political party. Its better in alot of ways. 
4232	The Electoral College is unique in many ways 
4233	The founding fathers established it in the Constitution as a Compromise between election of the President by a vote for President and Vice Preident, and the counting of the electoral votes by Congress. Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the preident, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president.       Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â     
4234	first reason isÂ not the same to take on school. 
4235	They're probably planning on making a new system or doing it for a personal matter. Either way, its all depending if the congress and the president himself to agree on this. 
4236	In a nutshell, electoral college has its upsides and downsides and is still up today. I beileve its an easy thing to say it all depends on opinion and beilefs.    
4237	I still think that the people will cofide more in popular vote showing them that they didn't just vote for no reason. 
4238	To feel as if the president is not on your side, i dont imagine that being any fun, that to me would be like rewarding one child and not the other for the same action. 
4239	We all are equal, wether by race, color, or age. We are all human, and we demand to be treated equal, if we dont get equal, keep trying until you do. Its always too early to give up. Always push yourself to high extents just like these canidates and maybe one day it will be you standing up for the majority vote, only hoping that the voters do not pick favorites, off of location. Before you decide make sure you know who youre voting for, and that there is a chance, that folur years from now, they could be re elected again, so please, put some thought into our society, and what social conflict does to us! America hass been torn apart because, of beliefs, religion, and democracies, and possibly is still suffering from all of these things, as i sit here and type this. There is a while world out there beyond those builded lines. Why did you pick thosae  lines in the first place.         
4240	If they do exist I would have no problem with that 
4241	but as of right not there is no evidence that they do. 
4242	They may be very smart people but they have no proof that this was done by a type of living being. They clearly state that everything they get is only facts and off research and strictly that nothing else. These people who are doubting nasa abviously have no idea what there talking about if they think nasa is purposley lying to us. They say that these faces are very normal and common and that this one has very different shadowing to help it look like adifferent face. 
4243	It makes sence why some poeple think different. I mean everybody has they own point of view on thuings. They wil stick to it to, they will consider them selves right still after you prove them wrong. People will always have there own perspective on things no matter what. so that means that mostly everybody will have some one that disagrees with them one way or another. Since this has opened up to the world in manny different ways, it makes it a whole lot easier to make up assumptions and nad there own way of thinking when it comes to this very starge but normal situation. Poeple have even seen thingslike this on the moon and that didnt phaze a single person. Its just people these days and how they think. they will just pull your leg. 
4244	It also could allow there to be more academic centered clubs.  The students who aren't eligible to play sports could also have tutors in the time they aren't spending on sports. 
4245	Dear senator i was wondering what the electoral college was. 
4246	All teens can think about is staying on the phone all the time. Technology has taken over the young minds of teens over the past few years. Not many people take to others face to face anymore. There some people that say they can not live without the uses of technology. 
4247	The policy should also apply for teachers too. 
4248	Mars has plenty of landforms and its normal for landforms to creat a shape or face. 
4249	Just because it makes a face on a planet doesn't mean aliens had anything to do with it. Under paragraph 5 you see a photograph of the face and many landforns surrounding it, so as you can see many landforms stand out on Mars. 
4250	so its a landform with a face but the shadows make up the face. NASA has been studying this for a long time,but for what ?, as you bcan see its just a landform not a face.  
4251	Many kids only enjoy playing sports or being in school activities like school dances, fundraises, field trips, etc. Taking away these rights to the children with grade C averages and above is just plain cruel. 
4252	Many students have a grade C average, but that is not their fault if that is the only grade they are able to get. If a student who doesn't have a grade B average wants to play a sport or join in an activity at school and enjoy it, wont be able to because of one class that is bringing their grade down. 
4253	Students should have to say good morning and have a big smile on their face when they walk in the classroom.  I encourage my friends to be happy with everyone because they might need that person one day 
4254	But some may get lost or broken, maybe they don't have a got telephone service.  
4255	Some of the students may not feel responsible enough for it and may think he wont do good enough or they will fail the task. 
4256	Although I would advise all teachers, before class to check every students' cell phone to make sure they are completely turned off and put away. This also includes the librarian checking for students cell phones also. 
4257	Well on my opinion I don't think the face is a natural landform, 
4258	in the text it states- twenty five years ago something funny happened around Mars. 
4259	If the face has been apart of Mars for ONLY twenty five years I don't think is was apart of martian life, it would've already been discovered a long time ago. 
4260	I honestly think it has been made up by an illusion. 
4261	I don't know maybe later in discovery the scientists of NASA will find out what and why this happened. NASA's budget wished there was an ancient civilization on Mars. I guess we'll have to find out later in the future. 
4262	"The ""Face on Mars"" has been starred in a Hollywood film, appeared in books, articles, magazines, radio talk shows, and even haunted grocery store checkout lines! "
4263	"Now you know why people are so amazed of being able to read about this story and give NASA so much feedbacks about this ""Face on Mars"" story. One day they'll determine what'll happen. "
4264	Most think that if we have electors we won't have as much trouble getting a person in office. 
4265	For example , the car has a mind of its own but what if some day it has a glich and you are inside the car, the glich will seel the doors and windows. When you know the whay to go, turning right at a stop but the glich or mistake it makes the auto go to the left. 
4266	Like i said depends on the school and the students, 
4267	This artical explains what electoral colleges are, how they help voting, and how they are bad. These three things give the reader the opion about this artical. 
4268	Students staying at home would not only benefit the student but also the parents since the outside world especially school can be a scary place. 
4269	The Electoral College balances out the amount of popular votes. 
4270	If both candidates are tied, we turn to the state electors. The candidate that has the biggest amount of electoral votes wins. One candidate can have more popular votes and very few electoral votes. The popular votes are just for the state electors to decide which they are going to pick. In the end it all goes down to them, The Electoral College, 
4271	The electoral college consists of 538 electors but if a majority is 270 electoral votes. Under the 23rd amendment of the constitution the district of columbia is allocated 3 electors and treated like a state for pourposes of the electoral college. You are choosing an electors when you vote for president because when you vote for a canidate u a really voting for your candidate's electors. 
4272	"In the first source its explain what a Electoral College is which is not a place it's a process the finding fathers established it in the Constitution as a compromise between election of the President by a Congress vote and by a popular vote of qualified citizens. Electoral College process consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the eledtors where they vote between a President and Vice President, and the counting of the electoral votes by Congress. The Electoral College has about 538 electors a majority of 270 are electoral votes is required to elect the President by which your state entitled allotment of electors equals the numer of members in its Congressional delegation: one for each member in the House of Representatives plus two for your Senators. The 23rd Amendment of the Constitution, the District of the Columbia is allocated 3 electors and treated like a state for purposes of the Electoral College. For this reason, in the following discussion, the word ""state"" also refers to the District of the Columbia. "
4273	"The second source talks about the Indefensible Electoral College:Why even the best best-laid defenses of the system are wrong like in the first sentence ""What have Richard Nixion, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and the AFl-CIO all, in their time, agreed on? The answer is Abolishing the electoral college! They're not alone; according to a Gallup poll in 2000, taken shortly after Al Gore--thanks to the quirks of the electoral college--won the popular vote but lost the presidency, but over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now. This following year voter have expect another close election in which the popular vote winner could again lose the presidency but yet the electoeral college still has its defenders. What give?... "
4274	The last source for the story talks about the defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President. Electoral College is widely regared as an anachronism and a non-democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be [overruled] by declasring the candidate who receives the most popular votes the winner. The advocatesos this postion are coorect in arguing that the Electoral College method is not democratic in a modern sense ... it is the electors who elect the president, not the people. Your votes for a presidential candidate your're actually voting for a slate of electors. There are a selects of parties that a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee.    Â     
4275	The American people thought they were lucky that 2000 fiaso was the biggest crisis in a century. The state legislatures are responsible for the picking electors. So maybe it was there fault, all I'll tell you this, they were not very lucky 
4276	To begin with, I think that we should change the election by popular vote for the president of the United States of America because the Electoral College doesn't even vote for the president 
4277	Sebastian Thurn believes that the technology of this generation compared to generations before us have come a long way, and that before Smart Cars, the was interesting qualities of cars we used before Smart Cars such as the absence of sensors, computers, and navigation.  
4278	To continue my agruement, the Electoral College is also unfair in this way. 
4279	This is not true because the number of electorals each state gets is always decided by the number of members that state has in the House of Representatives, plus two for the senators (Office of the Federal Register) 
4280	This means that the larger the state (in population, not size), the more their overall vote weighs 
4281	I don't think you want that though 
4282	but how often is that going to happen? 
4283	"It's kind of like when you're at a crossroads.Â  You and someone else get there at the same time.Â  They're to your right, so they have the right of way and can go first.Â  It doesn't matter that you got there at the same exact time, or even if you're going somewhere more important than where they're going.Â  It's like that with the election.Â  The Electoral College and the state may both be voting, but the Electoral College has the ""right of way"" and has more importance over us, whether they care who they're voting for or not. "
4284	There's a lot to be said about the Electoral College... Both good and bad, but in the end there isn't much anyone who is normal and whose vote barely counts for anything can do.Â  We can say how bad it is however much we want.Â  We can throw at you facts upon facts about how unnecessary or unfair the Electoral College is.Â  In the end, it's up to the government to decide what will happen, as it always has been. 
4285	"I can see why people would want to keep it. In source #3,  In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President , by Ricard A. Posner, says ""The Electoral College is a widely regarded as an anachronism, a non-democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be overruled by declaring a canidate who receives the most popular votes the winner."" It does offer support that maybe our country needs. Maybe we do need help in choosing who our president should be. The Electoral College gives us us a more official point of view on which president should be elected. "
4286	For what reason this is going to effect everyone, making all your students do this requirement might get alto of parents to come to your school, just to punish their kids for doing certain things and bringing them into awkward situations. 
4287	Besides having an electoral college we have a popular vote and it always turns out to be the president with less votes 
4288	"as it states in the passage ""it is entirely possible that the winner of the electoral vote will not win the national popular vote."" The electoral college consists of 538 electors, and from that 538 votes 270 electoral votes is required to elect the president, "
4289	but appearentley people belive that electoral college is unfair. 
4290	When ever using popular vote to determine the president than the process for it isnt long; this system is unfair too because of the people choosing the president because of the words and lies it says 
4291	"So many questions that have to be asked and answered; theres not many people that understand what the electoral college is for, but people also understand is how unfair it is to the people that vote.""The American people should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century; the system allows for much worse."" So appearentley there was a crisis including the electoral college, but we still kept this system even if the crisis barely happened in 2000.   "
4292	In Electoral College you vote for a wet number of electors and they give their own vote on their behalf. Now with popular vote say one state votes for president b rather then president a then the state votes for president b 
4293	in ruling out the electors that didnt vote for the president. So if theopposing pesident winns the election then he can single you out for note voting for him and i dont believe thats fair. 
4294	"like it says on source 2 paragraph 10 ""If you lived in Texas and wanted to vote for [John] kerry  "
4295	I understand that you wish to change our school policy regarding requirements for sports. 
4296	I think there are no aliens because astronauts have to have tanks filled with specialized air thats on Earth 
4297	Animals like , mammals , and reptiles can do things human beings cannot and will never be able to do . Reptiles may be able to poision its prey but Humans can't . Mammals can eat a human alive Humans cant do that ! Each group can do something the other one can't . One thing they all have in common is that they breathe air ! If aliens existed they wound not be able to survive unless they had a ' suit ' on the 24/7 . 
4298	"There have been multiple times people have claimed they've seen Big Foot they have "" videos "" , evidence and samples of the hair but scientist have not caught big foot so people can claim there are aliens all day long ; but until the world is able to see one in real life and scientist and everyone can see it ; it doesnt exist . "
4299	If an alien left an imprint on the rock that means it was walking and the face got stuck and it had to pull it off . There would be finger prints on the rock and foot prints in Mars 
4300	I believe that students should be allowed to have their cell phones with them as long as they are off in their bag or pocket. 
4301	i think without the Electoral college, we wouldn't have anyone to vote for the president or vice president. 
4302	most state have a winner take all system because it awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate. The 23rd Amendment of the constitution, the District of Columbia is allocated 3 electors and treated like a state for purposes of the Electoral College. 
4303	The word state refers to the District of Columbia. The Electoral College is a process, not a place. The founding fathers established it in the Constitution as a compromise between election of the President by a vote in congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens. We help choose our state's electors when we vote for president because when we vote for our candidate we are actually voting for our candidate electors. 
4304	I think the best laid defenses of the system are wrong because some voters might sometime vote for the wrong candidate and they might sometime get confused about the electors. After Al Gore thanks to the quirks of the electoral college, he won the popular vote but lost the presidency. Over 60 percent of voters would perfer a direct election to the kind we have now. This year voters can expect another close election in which the popular vote winner could again lose the presidency. The disaster factor is the single best argument against the electoral college. I agree that most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters because of the winner take all system in each state. Candidate don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning,focusing only on the tight races in the swing states. During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see the candidate at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina,and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn't see a single campaign ad. I agree that the it's official that the electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. The best agruments in favor of it are mostly assertions without much basis in reality. The agruments against direct elections are spurious at best. It's hard to say this, but Bob Dole was right. Abolish the electoral college. 
4305	I think the five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President was for its lack of democratic. The Electoral College is widely regarded as an anachronism, a non democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be overruled by declaring the candidate who receives the most popular votes the winner. I disagree the advocates of this postition are correct in arguing that the Electoral college method is ot democratic in a modern sense. It is the electors who elect the president, not the people. When we vote for a presidential candidate you're actually voting for a slate of electors because we're not actually voting for the president, we're just voting for the slate of electors. Each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee and that trust is rarely betrayed. However it it entirely possibe that the winner of the electoral vote will not win the national popular vote. The Electoral College avoids the problem of elections inn which no candidate receives a majority of the vote cast. I agree that they made the five reasons for retaining the Electoral College.    
4306	Me being a young teenager and only being in highschool, I feel as if we should keep the Electoral College. 
4307	citizens are going too choose the president they like 
4308	the president that they think will change things 
4309	the president that they think looks best. 
4310	Changing too the most popular vote will not be the best idea because, citizens are going too choose the president that they like regardless if the president is good or not so good. 
4311	If us citizens that are voting like the president, then chances are, we're going too vote for him or her. Not only are we going too vote for him or her, were also going to tell our friends too vote for them also so the president can get the most likes and get elected. With the Electoral College, the votes have to go through a process and then the election goes from there. 
4312	"Chances being with the most popular election is, we're going too get a not soo good president elected as our president. Most people think that if they choose the ""right"" president, then things are going too change when thats not true "
4313	". People think that once a new president gets elected that, things around the world are going too change. Yet, when things dont change, they all say ""well, I only her/him for them because he/she looked as if he/she could change things."" Just because he/she LOOKS like they could change something, doesn't mean its going too happen. That's where the saying ""don't judge a book by its cover"" comes in. "
4314	"I've heard many people say ""I voted for such and such as president because he/she looks best."" In an election for president, looks do not matter what so ever. "
4315	The president could be handsome or gorgeous and be the worst president in the United States and/or the president could be ugly and be the best president. In a president election, no one is going too care about the looks of the president. We're going too care about the person being voted for president, outlook on things as being the president. A lot comes with being a president and the looks surely aren't one of the things. In my personal opinion, if you're voting for the looks, then maybe you shouldnt be voting at all. 
4316	 There's many reasons on why we shouldnt change too the most popular vote election and why we should just stay with the Electoral College. The most popular vote election would not be the smartest idea of voting for president and honestly, in my opinion, I feel as if the Electoral College is best. Who would want a president being president because they got the most votes for being liked, voted because their the right president, or voted because they look the best? Truth be told, that's probably the worst thing too change too. With that being said, lets stick too the Electoral College.    
4317	Every single citizen votes for who they want. thats why i propose an idea. this idea is easier, faster and better... 
4318	On the flip side people and scientis have belived and wondered if aliens are real 
4319	and there is many cases to make people believe there are alien living amungst human along with movies, games, and toys. We are all fasinated by space and still think aliens are real and some think that aliens are not real. 
4320	according to artcile 1 elctoral college consist of 538 electors. and a majority of 270 elcortal votes is required to elect the president. According to 23rd admendment of the consititution the district of columba is allocated 3 elctors. each canidate running for president in your state has his or her own group of elctors. they can be either deicranditate or republic. 
4321	According to the second artlice under the elctoral college system, voters tates vote for one person thevote not for the president. in second passage it says the single best agrument against the elctoral college is what we might call disator factor. in artilce 2 it say at most basic level , the elctoral college is unfair to voters. 
4322	so with that being said i think i would be against colloege elctoral because it is unfair. why would u agree with a thing that is not fair 
4323	the elctoral college is unfair, outdated,and irrational. so thats why i would not choise elctoral vote. 
4324	in the 3 section it shows the number pf votes given to eah state. not ever state gets same number of votes as others some only have couple of votes. to me i thi nk each state shoukld have same amount of vote so its fair .because if all big so then it would be unfair. 
4325	"This icon have became very popular. For example in pargargraph 5 its says "" its starred in Hollywood Films, appeared in books, magazines, and is in radio talk shows. This shows that the icon is really popular and many people know and talk about the icon. "
4326	The facts are that there are people building cars that are partially computer driven. For the car that could be bad or good, but if it faults you wont be able to know until it acctually faults while driving which is a huge safety hazard. The car is made for teens, and grown-ups to have fun and comfort or one of them. 
4327	You might see students walking around school thinking about sports or other activities ,and that will be the only thing that they will be having on their mind. 
4328	Electoral College lack democratic pedigree, also there practical reason, liberal and conservative reason. 
4329	What I found out that is also not fair is to the citizens and state who vote, is that the winning candiate's share his share of popular vote with the Electoral College. 
4330	First of all, we voted for the candiate not for the electoral. We don't know the electoral. Knowing this, we the citizens just might not vote anymore. The electoral is not sharing the presidential house, we choose one person to look up too. Not the greedy electoral. Some states don't even vote anymore because they know that there vote has no effect 
4331	It's hard to say this but Bob Dole was right: Abolish the Electoral College! 
4332	This plan will work if you put it into action and I strongly hope you take my request into recommendation. 
4333	Second of all people who favored the seperation of race. 
4334	There is always the possibility of the disater factor. 
4335	I have to tell that the idea of tell us about this cange and for give us the opportunity to let us tell you, our opinion is good. 
4336	Thanks to the electoral college the 2000 election was a disaster 
4337	The electotral college doesnt work in my opinion. It has too many flaws such as you are voting for a state. Thanks to the electoral college the 2000 election was a disaster. The electoral college system is unfair in a way because if your from some where with a lot of points your going to win that state. And if you win lots of small states it doesnt matter because someone can win two big states and beat you. Obviously candidates arent going to spend a lot of time in a state they know they have no shot of winning.       Â   
4338	The winner take all method of awarding electoral votes induces the candidates,Â  to focus on their campaign; the voters in toss-up states are more likely to pay close attention to the competing candidates. 
4339	Sometime out can not get your grades all up to passing in time. also i am not good at school but i still try.  I think i should get the right to play sport because sports can be job when you get older and it will also keep you in shape just not that but aliened.  So based on behavior i think they could not be able to play but just not because of bad grades. 
4340	So i was wondering if you would considered not letting theses kids play sports because the don't have a bee average. 
4341	If it was my opinion I would not have cell phones in my pocket so i can call my mom when i get to school otherwise you do not need your phone to text during school hours. 
4342	Making a charity for the homeless people 
4343	The best arguments in favor is the popular vote, but some canidates still lose from the presidency. 
4344	Looking at the breakdown of the number of electoral votes given to each state-California has the most votes. No region has enough electoral votes to elect a president. 
4345	or instance, as Romney was in the South he had no campaign heavily in those states. He gained no electoral votes. 
4346	In toss-up states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign-to really take notice inthe competing canidates. Those voters sre the ones to decide the election. 
4347	Run-Off elections should be avoided, it would greatly complicate the presidential election process.  
4348	however the electoral college is unfair to voters, because of the winner-take-all system in each state. 
4349	In way many people were grateful for this kind art education in many ways people use this place for so long to know how many scarefices that many people choose this area than no other. There got to be a diffrent reason to come in mind for can stop this idea from elimanating this fine place to construct for all years of hard work 
4350	For so long many people still would like to choose this college as great example for their success. 
4351	This my letter to you senator. But if you refuse this than i don't know what i would do,butÂ  what I do know is you choose what it came from your mind I can not stop you from picking the good or badÂ  choices but I can help you pick the right choice. As well making a election area that only happens in four years is not really worth anything many would disagree for this nonsense build and just forget what just came in mind and pick the right choice 
4352	because it consists of 538 electors and the majority (270) that are the electoral votes that are required to elect a president. 
4353	ElectorÂ  groups are picked by the runner; the groups help raise votes for the runners to get more word out on what the runner has to offer for our country. Plus, they make sure the elector running, has good legitiment reasons for becomeing our countries representor. With the presidential election held every four years, the Electorial College can be still processing men, and women, who are wanting to represent our country. 
4354	Some school offer distance learning as an opinion for studentsÂ to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. the students not focus in home sometime, for the TV,Â videoÂ games, and cell phones. The 20% the students, not go to school because is more difficult, but 80% the students go to schoolÂ students don't benefit because have a distraction in home the TVs,Â areÂ distraction or watching moviesÂ the students not focus in work in study some not doing a work or copies in internetÂ . 
4355	Students don't have a friends because not work in groups sometime 
4356	not distraction with other students and more distraction in home sometime not focus some students said 5% the students not focus in house because the cell phones distract the students not benefit being able to attend classes from home.  The some students storyÂ and online becauseÂ in the morning not necessary take a shower or not wake up late, but some students is more fanny story in school because distract 
4357	The video conferencing you need to pay for a classes, inÂ work some students have a job, and pay school. 
4358	Connected to, served by, or available through a system and especially a computer or telecommunications system as the internet also done while connected to a system, online shopping. 
4359	The Electoral College consists of 538 electors the majority only 270 votes is required for the final dessision. Each candidate running for the president has his or her own group of electors but the state law varys how many are selected. The presidential election is held every four yearson the tuesday after the first monday of november.  The states are called districts for example the word state also refers to the disrict of Columbia. 
4360	You can help choose your states electors when you vote forpresident. Even though your voting for your candidate your really voting for the candidates electors. 
4361	After the presidential election your govenor prepares a certificate of ascertainment listing all of your candidates who ran for president in your state. The Certificate of Ascertainment also declares the winning presidential candidate in your state at the meeting of the electors in December. Then the certificate is sent to the congressÂ  and the national records of the presidential election.    
4362	The production of driveless cars and the cost to buy driverless cars would cost alot. This would also affect the buyers and the manufacturers in a negative way. 
4363	Finally, even if there was to be a driverless cars, it would not be completely driverless. This would cause concern for the manufacturers and the buyers. 
4364	That is much more rewarding. 
4365	"The idea of these ""Driveless Cars"" does sound intersting and at the most fascinating. But however i'm going to say i'm all that for that particular idea for a few reasons "
4366	Electoral College is a great thing and some people might think its not, but there is some wrong things about it like voters vote not for the president, but for slate of electors who in turn elect the president 
4367	It hepls us decide who our president and vice presidents will be 
4368	And most of the reason that people want to stop it is because they think that some of the nominees arent getting what they deserve. 
4369	"And to be fair, after the presidential election is over, our govenor prepares a ""Certificate of Ascertainment"" listing all of the candiates who ran for president in our state along with the names of their respective electors. "
4370	The presidential election is held every four years on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. You help choose your states electors when you vote for president because when you vote for your candidate you are usually voting for your candidates electors.  Each candidate running for president in your state has his or her own group of electors. The electors are generally chosen by the candidates political party, but state laws vary on how the elecotrs are selected and what their responsibilities are.  The advocates of this position are correct in arguing that the Electoral College method is not democratic in a modern sense...it is the electors who elect the president, not the people. So when you vote for your president your acually voting for the slate of electors. 
4371	They dont actually have to do everything now...thanks to the Electoral College. 
4372	Our solar system is huge there is alot of planets, and more uknown things humans do not know about. Many things can be floating around in outer space from other planet bigger or smaller. The peice of that planet or object broke off of could had of entered Cydonia atmosphere, and caused that landform to exist.  Many things have difrent ways of cleansing, and many other different ways of doing things. We do not know if the planet Cyndia caused the unsual lamdform itself from amy kid of element storms and much more. 
4373	The planet Cyndia is very rare with the landform it has own it there could be many more planets and unknown things that have rare landforms about them in the big solar system,      
4374	Because imagaine what a catastrophe it would be if we did not have the Electoral College, how would they count the votes 
4375	Anybodyvoted on who you wanted to win it go can cheat the number of votes to change the president they are voting for. With the Electoral College you can't do that because,Â  once you voted who you want to win, it get sent out tothe electors. Who from that point on count how many voted for both of them and decide a winner. 
4376	Now it is possible for somebody to secretly change the names that way but it is a higher stake, or risk to take not having the Electoral College. 
4377	Also, it is possible for worker of the Electoral College to make a mistake in countung the counting the votes and to cause a big confussion in the votes but that is very highly impossible, if not impossible. 
4378	I think that the Face on Mars is just a natural landform. 
4379	But we never found lava on Mars? Well we will look for it and how do you think it got on there. And if there is not lava of Mars? Then its might just be a natural land form like mountains on Earth. What if people lived there and got covered in dust like material? I don't think there could be humans of Mars because of the lack of oxygen,food,water and bactreia so there in on way peopel could live on Mars. 
4380	These are some reasons that I think that the Face on mars is just a natural landform. 
4381	After the presidential election, the governor prepares a certificate of ascertainment listing all of the candidates who ran for president in the state along with the names of their respective electors. the state's certificates of ascertainments are sent to the congress and the national archives as part of the official records of the presidential election.  The electoral college consists of 538 electors. each candidate running for president in the state has his or her own group of electors. the electors are generally chosen by the candidate's political party, but state laws vary on how the electors are selected and what their resonsibilities are. The founding fathers established it in the constitution as a compromise between election of the president by vote for president and vice president, and the counting of the electoral votes by congress.  the electroal college is widely regarded as an anachronism, a non-democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be overruled by declaring the candidate who receives the most popular votes the winner. when you vote for a presidential candidate you're actually voting for a slate of electors. Each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee and that trust is rarely betrayed, however it is entirely possible that the winner of the electoral vote will not win the national.    
4382	Now if for some reason the majority voted in a really crazy man into office that would completely corupt the government then it would be good too have something else that can change teh vote so that America does not get anymore corrupted. 
4383	The only problem is how many times would you vote for a crazy person who you know will affect you in a very major way? My guess is not very often.  
4384	Now there is some perks but they are really only for the losing president. If the pesident did not win all of the popular vote he could have won a lot more swing states than his opponent which help him better in the electoral election(posner ph20). 
4385	So there is only one way that the electoral colledge is helpful and it is not even to the American voters. This is why we need a change and to get rid of the electoral colledge. 
4386	I've heard about the changes you want to make and I have a lot of suggestion on it 
4387	for example if you do a community service for 20 hours in elementary school that the only think that is going to make you pass to high school. 
4388	Voters in presidential elections are the people who want to express a political preference rather than the people woh tihnk a single vote can dicide an election. 
4389	"All the ""driverless"" cars now can't navigate through any work zones or car accidents. Only thing these cars can do is steer, accelerate, and brake by themselves. What good are they if they can't manuever through things by themselves? "
4390	If someone was texting and driving in their driverless car and they let their car take over and their driverless car failed to drive by itself and a accident occured who would be to blame? 
4391	it is easier to elect a president then having to go through a process of sending in votes by hand 
4392	It is better to send votes by computer because all you have to do is click a button and the the vote is sent to the elector. 
4393	Under the 23rd admendment of the constitution 3 elctors were allocated in the district of columbia. The electors are to be treated like a state for a purpose. As stated in (what is the electoral collage)'' the word state also refers to the district of columbia. Therefore the electoral collage selectes each candidate runnig for president. Also each state has its own personal group of electors. The political party is candidates who chose the electors.  The electoral collage starts every for years to selecte a new president. Every first tuesday in november people help choose state electors when voting for the new president. People sometimes dont get that you are not actually voting for the president you are voting for the candidates electors.  Once the president is elected the govenor prepares a ''certificate of ascertainment. Once that happens the listing of all the candidates who ran for president in a state and their names respective electors.       Â        Â        Â     
4394	Also, if the kids have their cell phones out during free time or lunch break they could be sending out some things such as showy pictures of themselves and sending the pictures to different people in other schools or people around the school. 
4395	because it would be a great process where students can work their way up to become a congressman, 
4396	it would also look good on your reputation. 
4397	It would be a great process where students can work their way up to become a congressman. 
4398	Imagine all the wonderful things you can learn about congress and you can have your own personal experience. The electoral College consists of 538 electors. A majority of 270 electoral votes is requried to elect the President. Your state's entitled allotment of electors equals the number of members in the Congressional delegation: one for each memeber in the House of Representatives plus two for your Senators. Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for aslate of electors, who in turn elect the president. If you live in Taxas, fpr instance, and wanted to vote for John Kerry, you'd vote for a slate of 34 Democatic electors pludges to Mr. Kerry. 
4399	It would look good on your reputation. 
4400	"Each candidate running for president in your state has his or her own group of electors. I know your would wat that because that would be great, and really helpful. The presidential election is held every four yoears on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. You help choose your candidate you are actually voting for your candidate's electors. After the presidentialÂ  election, your governor prepares a ""Certificate of Ascertainment"" listing all of the candidates who ran for president in your state along with the names of their respective electors. Your state's Certificates of Ascertainments are sent to the Congress and the National Archives as part of the official recors of the presidential election. "
4401	But if it's serious than they could go to the office and ask them if they could leave but it wouldn't be ok with the office because your parent has to be at the school to sign you out for example yesterday my mom came to school to pick me up early for an emergency so she had to go in the office to tell them that i am here to pick up my kid.      
4402	The face is an natural landform like the article said  
4403	It is not a complicated system that people don't understand and works well with our country. Electoral College should stay, many would argue it is not a democratic modern sense but this country is a democracy so of course the system of which we pick our president has to be democratic. 
4404	A lot of students would want to bring their grades up because they would like to participate in sports. That's a way students can bring up their grades. Maybe the students can bring their grade up and that way the students can work harder in class. 
4405	That way students can work hard and participate in a sport that they deserve for getting good grades. 
4406	This policy may work so students can bring their grade up and stop failing their classes. One way they can bring up their up and be able to participate in sports is by turning in there homework and completing their work in class. 
4407	"According to the passage""What is the Electoral College"" by the Office of the Federal Register, the Electoral college is a process, not a place. This means that it is not in a certain place it is all over the United States.Â  The founding fathers established it in the Constitution as a compromise between election of the President by a popular vote of qualififed citizens.Â  The presidential election is held every four years on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. "
4408	Proceeding further, the Electoral College is based of the electors you pick and then they decide of who becomes president by the popular vote.Â  When you are voting for a presidential candidate you're actually voting for a slate of electors.Â  Each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee. 
4409	Most people my age do not understand that they are part of something greater.  We would rather be out at the latest movie or shopping for the latest fashions.  
4410	Moreover, the Electoral Vote is like the king of a country, it decides the president and its votes. 
4411	"In the Constitution there is an amendment that says evryone is equal . however in this except from  (Source 3)  says otherwise, "" So, other things being equal, a large state gets more attention from presidential candidates in a campaing than small states does..."" The founding father were part of the Constitution but also part of the Electoral Vote, which have been taken that amendment way too far. "
4412	policy 2 i don't under stand why u guys don't allow in on school grounds when you know people will still do it 
4413	they would be talking dirty on the phone so u need more people watching around the school.  we need 3 secrity guard watching the school too not only one.  
4414	order 
4415	actrecy. 
4416	because if the public were to vote on who is the new president of the Untied States some people might fight and argure over who's the new president, why he should be their, and a lot of other reasons. The population might think he will be a great guy and a good president, and that everything will turn out ok. Then when they are elected it turns out he might not be such a great president after all, he's probably going to make all the wrong decides and choices for this nation after a becomes president. 
4417	It's not fair that a majority of people get to vote extra. 
4418	"The candidate's get to choose people who will vote for the person who picked them just bc they picked them. They probbaly dont have good reasons on the they pick that candidate they just pick him/her because they picked that person. They candidate who did win the election their electorial voters get a przie just for helping them win the election. And the others well they get nothing. It's not fair to the other people who voted for their apponite. All they get is a ""Thanks for voting"". Presidents voters get a cerification for helping them when. It's not fair to everyone else "
4419	Sometimes they candidate they picked to win isn't even a good presidant. 
4420	They can't hold up to their side of the deal. the President says he/she will fix our economy and then the economy drops. They say they will prvovied a better education for students and they don't. Two electors from the same state can go to Congress. The candidates pick people from the states who know that the will vote for that specific candidates. 
4421	n 2000 campaign, in total, seventeen sates didn't see the candidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina. 
4422	In 25 of the largest media market a majority of voters did not go see any of the campaign ads. 
4423	Candidates will bribe voters and Electorial Collage voters just to vote for that candidate and not they other. 
4424	It's not fair to the other candidte who plays by the book for losing to someone who goes around the book to get more votes just to be President. 
4425	The people want to have a say, not someone choosing for them.  
4426	This is a big give away if it was aliens we would be able to tell 
4427	aliens probably wanted it to be like that 
4428	If aleins really did make that don't you think they would keep track of it the stucture 
4429	because they also help the voters with thier votes also because all the other people have candidate which makess it easy for electors who democrafts in texas because they know this will not have any effect in them otherwise they wouldnt vote but the electors need good reasons why the voters should vote for them so you would need to have specific facts and good source and why would you make a great president or why you think your better than the other elector all this questions and more you have to persuade them in any possible way but with truth no lies like if you promise the world for better oppportunities you have to prove to them youre actually willing to do this and be part of thier lives by changing the way they live not only that but you have to accomplish your goals . At the end whoever has more votes is the winner the people who voted for you are especting the best out of you bascally thier putting all thier trust in you, someone they have no clue who you are and why are the exact reason your thier or what your goals are,    
4430	My third opinionÂ would be why not try it you know maybe you'll like it. 
4431	If people want to change the election for popular votes Â is basically your generallly chosen by the candidates politcal party...and what their responsibilities are 
4432	My response to that not everybody is chosen by politcal party. 
4433	Now, if people want to change the election by popular voting is held every four years on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. You help choose your states electors when you vote for presidents because when you vote for your candidates you are actually voting for your candidates electors. 
4434	"My response to that is..sometimes presidents want to be president because ""they want to change everything in the United States like ..taxes..and health insurance. For example like Obama care he has change the health insurance and people dont like that. And 2016 theres going to be a new President in the United States.    "
4435	I showed him a messa and how they shadow. 
4436	You also have to think about the people who disagree with changing the system. People can stop voting if they dont like the system. If nobody votes,then are country cant move fourth into the future,and if that happens the USA mint have a civil war. From a diffrent stand point it mint not be a bad thing to get a new system. This is just another reason why we shouldnt change the system of voting. 
4437	The system we have now makes sure not one man has more power than the next man or woman. Think about the improving we have done to the current system,before blacks even couldnt vote into they improved the system. Back then their were alot of errors and stuff wrong with the process into they started improving. Now,why would you want to throw all that hard work away. This is just another why another why we shouldnt get rid of the current voting system. 
4438	For instance if they didnt make a amedement to stop slavery then,blacks wouldnt even be able to vote. How bout they didnt make a amendment to give girls the right to vote then the power will still be shifted. You also cant forget how many people fought to make the power equal. If the power is shifted in the tighest a civil war can break out,and ruin what we worked so hard to protect. This was the last reason why we shouldnt chang the system. 
4439	Community service can be good for people with spare time but others have no time for something such as this. 
4440	Community service could be as much as making sure that when you roll your car windows down that no trash in your car flies out.  Most kids help the community in little ways like this and don't even now that they are but it makes a big difference. 
4441	On the other hand making kids do community service no matter what could be a good thing. 
4442	So then again maybe we should do community service. 
4443	some dont follow the consititution when they vote. 
4444	Most people are too busy, or lazy, or just dont want to take part in voting becuse of all of the conficting ads placed on television. One of the most atrocious of these ads was the one from mitt romney when he was in the race against President Obama. They put these ads on a chanel designated for familys to veiw, along with children. These ads inculded vivid pictures of aborted fetus, saying this is what would happen if we voted for obama. I've only saw that ad once, but once was more than enough to make me side with Obama more than I already was. If our president is prepared to threten the country like that then they should not be eligable to even run, let alone become President, and it was horendus to think of all of the children watching at the time to have to see that. Most Americans who are eligable to vote have full-time jobs, full-time school, or are busy in some other aspects of life. These people do not have the time to vote for our president becuase they are working at the time, most work one or two jobs at the least, leaving little time for social graces and time alone, let alone time to vote. One other reason citizens dont vote is just hte sheer fact that they are lazy. A good precetage of Americans just do not care about who our president is or who runs for office, thus not voting out of sheer laziness. 
4445	Almost all Americans have voted baised on their beliefs, or who is running for president. These are the people who voted agaoinst obama becuase of his ethnic background, or what he looked like. This should not go against who we vote for, or who leads us, as long as they are non-biased in what they stand for and have the good of the people in their minds, then they should be eligable, or even voted, as a canidate/president/offical. 
4446	To continue, letting the majority vote on our new president would have potential if the majority of Americans followed the consititution when voting. 
4447	"The majority does not follow the consitiution when voting for our new president, thus inducing an unfair campaine and an biased leader. The consitiution clearly states the Church and State are to be seperated, yet many Americans vote baised on the beliefs of their Church on matters of the State. The latest case of this happening was for the ban on gay marrige. Most voters voted in favor of the ban due a passage in the bible that stated that man shall not lay with another man as he lays with a woman, even though there is a homosexual couple in the bible, mathew/mathius something. The story aout a man named Dave and another named John, if i remember correctly, one of them said ""your love exceeds that of a woman"" or something close to that. There are a number of testiments that say not to judge others or to love everyone, but most focus on the one against those. Baising your vote on spiritual beliefs does not help anyone and is unfair towards those whos lifes you are negativly affecting. We should all think logically when voting for our leaders, and ask questions like 'who will this affect' 'how will this improve apon the lifes of my fellow Americans' 'will this improve our dilapitiating economy and crippling structe of the government' along with other questions that relate to how this canidate will improve apon the country as a whole. "
4448	But sometimes it's good for them and our community, well its always good for our community.  
4449	It can leave memorable moments in someone slife 
4450	Please try and give this idea a chance Principal. 
4451	I don't know what to tell you i just know that's not a cool thing to us we love playing sports and love joining into clubs but if that's going to be your new rule well that's kinda not cool 
4452	Why is populary voting a better choice may many ask, popular voting is a better choice because it allows voters to have fair chance of having their choice of President, become Presidnt. 
4453	Lastly, having community service could get us ready to have a stable job and understand the responsibility of it when we have one 
4454	ho wants to get fired on the first day right? 
4455	Don't think for a second that there isn't a person animal or plant the doesn't need your help! 
4456	"Even though some may believe that ""students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home"" "
4457	it should be known that student would not benefit from attending classes at home. 
4458	","" as stated in the articel  What is the Electoral College? by The Office of Federal Register . Which makes the Electoral a great part of doing the highst or popular vote of President. Not only that but""  each candidate running for President in your state has his or her own group of electors.  "" which helps them amd still be equal enough to the other runing President. In the article  The Indefensible Electoral Colloege: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong it says in the bottem of the fist paragraph ""  This year voters can expect another close election in which popular vote winner could again lose the presidency. And yet, the electoral college still has its defenders.  "" which is saying that most Americans prefre to have this electoral college for popular votes. "
4459	"and yet the electoral college still has its deffenders what gives"". "
4460	The Electoral College provides different opportunities for other political members as well by the common people. 
4461	In this voting method you are able to trust each member running 
4462	they are for people who wants to express himslef politically 
4463	The Electoral College requires candidates that are trustworthy not only to others but to everyone. 
4464	"Slate Magazine that ,""... each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee..."" This basicaly means that we get to choose which candidate that we can trust with more big political problems.Â  This shows that we will be heard through these electors that we know we can trust. Although it different cases, this might become a democratic problem from we are not able to speak personally, atleast we know how they will manage and work the elections properly.  "
4465	Different people have different perspectives on several things,especially when it comes to politics. Political places need the different views of other people to be able to make a non biased decision. They want to see how others feel and think about different situations 
4466	By keeping the Electoral College, we will be able to express our different political references. 
4467	"it was stated that ""Voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a political reference..."". In defense to the Electoral College, people who were to vote are the same people who wants to express how they feel about one thing. The people who vote might feel so strongly about political situation than others. "

4470	so I think you need to do good in school to play or do school. stuff 
4471	or you can talk to the principal and try to change his mind and get people to play, or you can talk to the teachers and get them to change his mind 
4472	that will work to he mite do it and he mite not any way you tried to get him to change his mind 
4473	if you do good in school that mite do the trick to. 
4474	If you do not change the policy i will not do any work at the school and we will be arguing about this. Do not think we will let this go we will not. 
4475	when we vote we are also voteing for electors to work with the presidents and help him make desions. 
4476	what a lot of people dont know when they vote they are also voteing for other electors. 
4477	it should be what the people feel most comfortable choosing 
4478	It can be argued that the electoralÂ  college method of selecting the president may turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state. Democrats in texas for example or republicans in california knowing their vote will have no effect they have less incentive to pay attention to the campaign that they would have if the president were picked by popular but of course no voters vote swings a national election and in spite of that about one half the elgible american population did vote in 2012 election. Voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election 
4479	A dispute over the outcome of an electoral college vote is possible it happened in 2000 but its less likely than a dispute over the popular vote the reason is that the winning candidates share of the electoral college invairably exceeds his share of the popular vote in 2012's election for example Obama received 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to 51.3 percent of the popular votes cast for him and Romney .Â  . . . because almost all states award electoral votes on a winner take all basis even a very slight plurality in a state creates a landslide electoral vote victory in that state A tie in the nationwide electoral vote is possible because the total number of votes 538 is an even number but it is higly unlikely .....  
4480	On passage 2:The indefensable electoral college says under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of the president 
4481	For example, on source 2: The indefensible electoral collegeÂ  says that if you lived in Texas and you wanted to vote for John Kerry, you'd vote for a slate of 34 Democratic electors pledged to Kerry even though you are not voting for electors just for John Kerry. Electoral college makes you or forces you to do things you arent aware of. 
4482	in a postive way these are allowed to be tested in most states and upgraded to the point of the driver can receive alters to notify them on things. 
4483	Any technology we have is not 100% reliable. The system can break down in the middle of the road, and someone could die. We should not risk our safety or our lives on a machine that is not fully safe. 
4484	they need to keep the most popular one by elections because it would be fair to people to have the electoral votes. 
4485	it seems to me that the votes keep going down because people dont like the way they have to vote its going astronomical they need to take control NOW ! 
4486	"Even though candidates might now want to spend time going through the head ache of focusing on because to me its the most baic level and it UNFAIR to all voters all around the globe . Allthough my opinion is people need to realize to some of the overruled voters are all not electoral college dont mean you cannot vote for regular its entirely inpossible for the ""new president"" not to win and thats one reason why people pick that source because they know for a fact that they wll win their president they voted for this on coming ""election"" . ALL votes go to the house / state senate and it goes uphill from there so according to the passage all the electroal college requires a presidental candidate to have a regional appeal . But in 2012 President Barak Obama almost didnt make president until they put the electroal votes all together and we won PRESIDENT !! But of course knowing your vote you need to have to pay attition to the camapaign that the presidentcy were picked by a popular more VOTE . Even though votes swing on a national election one and a half americans express a petherance than a acual single vote which is probalbly much faster and easier on us and the senate. "
4487	Knowing that people want to make sure our country stays in place they vote the correct presdient for the next four years so make the correct descision.    
4488	it will be easier for most kids in this school 
4489	it will teach them not to do whatever it is that they did again. The child should be given a task and a certain amount of hours to do this said task. 
4490	I think my opinions seem fair enough and better than forcing the children. 
4491	Well tough , the Electoral College ensures a winner, and that is all that matters. 
4492	why you wouldnt want to take the process of the electorial college to pick a president? All of the pieces seem to fall into place. So isnt it the obvious choice? 
4493	It is also not a democratic method of selecting the next person in office. 
4494	look into the elctoral college. It is obviously the right choice. 
4495	By also keeping the electoral college we make it so their is no chance of a tie. Like if a person from the electoral college were to betray his state. 
4496	If it were to happen the state would be very disappionted and would look down upon him or her. 
4497	We all expect them to make the right choise for the whole state and they feel that pressure. Everyone only influences what the person is going to pick. But some people fold under pressure and do what theÂ  other person wants. That can also be a good thing. 
4498	If every state thinks differntly then their would still be a chance for the other person to win even if other states voted for the other person. If one person got a lot of states to like them then the other peson wouldnt stand a chance if real people were voting and they would lose against a landslide victory. 
4499	If you had a friend that voted for the person you didnt want to win and they won you would mad and argry. They would just rub it in your face and say you lost and could lead to fights or even killings. The smart desion would be to keep the electoral college. 
4500	By keeping it everyone is happy and will accept things easier. But if we were to abolish it the towns and cities would go and rampage with families borken and friendships being torn apart. And we can prevent that by just keeping the electoral college.    
4501	source 1: what is the electoral collage?  by the office of the federal register  The electoral college is a proccess,not a place. The founding established it in the U.S. constitution as a compromise between election of the president and the congress and the election of the president by a polpular vote of qualified citizens.(  paragraph, 1 sentance, 1).  The electoral college consists of 538 electors a majority of 270 electors votes are required and is reqiured to elect the president(paragraph 3 sentance 1) 
4502	Wich is much harder to do that pursudeing the people there for giving us a good honest president than one that will lie or try to hurt the public in any way 
4503	It is either the elector is trusted to pick the right president, or the president is trusted do do the right thing.    
4504	This could also be a punishment for kids. 
4505	So if there were to have bad grades, You could tell them either you do better or do community service. 
4506	That would just be unfair from my point of view, and im pretty sure parents would agree with me. 
4507	How does that help? It helps because if there stuck on a question or need help with there homework. The older grades can tutor them or explain to them 
4508	Well I hope You consider on taking this letter a help 
4509	"Then there are some students who don't really get what ""No phones in class"" means.  "
4510	This just might help you to. I am almost sure that schools have to pay a phone bill, am i right? well by letting teens use their phones you can decrease the bill, or even better get rid of all the extra phones. 
4511	Then if you need to get a hold of someone in another room you have the PA speakers.  
4512	"First off I want to let you know that Electoral College is a process and not a place. It was established by the founding fathers. Process consists of the selection of the electors, the metings of the electors where they vote for president and Vice President. The electoral college consists of 538 electors and the majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the president. The amount of members in its congressional delegation, ""one for each member in the House of Representatives plus two of your Senators"". The candidate that's running for president in your state has it's own group of electors. They're generally chosen by the candidate's political party but that state law varys on how the electors are selected and what their responsibilities are. "
4513	One of the best things about the Electoral College is that it's widely regarded as an anachronism and a non-democratic method of the selecting of a president that ought to be overruled by declaring the candidate who receives the most popular votes wins. 
4514	"it also requires a president candidate to have transregional appeal. Always remember ""voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election.    "

4516	This face shaped mound on mars has just thrown all the theories out and has caused a big worry in the world. Personally I did not see the face until i had read through the article pretty much pin-pointing all of the features, so i went back to the picture of the face and that when i did see it. One persons theory has caused problems for everything from t. v. to conversations. 
4517	The fact of the matter is that when you look at this mound and you are told its a face you are most likely gonna beleive that concept until you get the scientific facts and you read them and you probably still wont beleive it, because as humans there has always got to be something that drives you to be excited. Its in our genetics and our concept is just going to be stuck with until there is an actual reasoning that can be proven. 
4518	With all the new technology and new inventions of technology it is harming the world. It is causing health issues, social and economic issues, and riots. 
4519	More than half of the entire world is obese, the number of obese citizens is growing larger and larger. The use of technology plays a very large role in obesity. Young children and people of all ages for that fact grow addicted to social media, video games, and many other things. The use of cell phones, which many people can not go anywhere without, harms the brain and kills the cells in your brain along with exposing your body to unneeded radiation.

What if the car was told to go somewhere and went to wrong way? will it be the cars fault. And if the car got broken down for no reason during traffic will it be okay for other people. 
4522	The electoral college is not a place, but a process. 
4523	A process that seems meaningless, a process that is uncalled for. 
4524	Some of the problems its caused was how others win automatically if the president they pledged to won the electoral college vote. This method of voting has to go. 
4525	this is presidency here, not what game we should play in Gym! majority vote makes absolutely NO sense whatsoever. I mean come on, we are deciding the next LEADER of our country! 
4526	Well thats really all I have to say. I hope you read this letter and maybe you can send it to your superiors or whoever it is you work for to get my letter read by the President. And see if we can fix this problem here. 
4527	but, that is their oppinion. 
4528	Because this progress is widely regarded as an anachronism, a non-democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be [overruled] by declaring the candidate who receives the most popular votes the winner. 
4529	The meeting of the electors where they vote for President and Vice President, and the counting of the electoral votes by congress. This process consists of 538 electors. The amount of 270 electoral votes is requiered to elect the President. The district of Columbia is allocated 3 electors and treated like a state for purposes of The Electoral College. Each candidate that is running for President in your state has his or her own group of electors. 
4530	It is necessary to have this groups so you can be the president. 
4531	Each thing has its own benefit and purpose. 
4532	we shouldn't be held to that by other people and their threats. We should be the ones to care for our grade ,and if it gets too low we should take responsibility and take ourselves out of sports. 
4533	So with that being siad there were no aliens there to put this face on mars i mean for you to think that it was aliens wouldnt you have to have proof that it was aliens or some evidence. Anything to prove that it was aliens but for now we can only say that it wasnt aliens who do this because no one has no proof. That it was aliens no signs no tracks no nothing. So it couldnt have been aliens. This is how you know that it wasnt aliens who did this 
4534	Dont believe this because its slightly untrue because if you believe that aliens are real then of course your going to believe that aliens have came and put this face on mars. 
4535	In my opinion aliens arent real and they didnt put this face on mars why cant people do research just to figure out if aliens are capable of doing these things. I honestly dont think that aliens would do this. just because i actually dont believe that they are real. 
4536	So thats why im here to change anyones opinion about this face on mars. If it were aliens couldnt there have been some type of markings somewhere some how because if you think about it aliens can leave tracks too so if there wernt any trackings on the seen then aliens couldnt have done it. So with that being siad there were no aliens there to put this face on mars i mean for you to think that it was aliens wouldnt you have to have proof that it was aliens or some evidence. Anything to prove that it was aliens but for now we can only say that it wasnt aliens who do this because no one has no proof. That it was aliens no signs no tracks no nothing. So it couldnt have been aliens. This is how you know that it wasnt aliens who did this it is a natrual landform that is just there not one put it there. 
4537	The Face was made by natural landform not created by aliens. 
4538	I argue that the Face wasn't created by aliens but from natural landforms. 
4539	I don't have a cell phone because there is no room on the plan for me right now because I have five sisters and four brothers. In my school you are aloud to bring your cell phones but you can't use it at all in school. 
4540	To state senator i'm argue is that we should keep the Electoral College 
4541	because it's a place where we vote on President and Vice President 
4542	and the place where we count the votes 
4543	and the Electioral College process consists of the selection of the electors. 
4544	because it's in the Constitution as a compromise between election of the President by a vote in congress. And election of All the soon President by a popular vote of qualified citizens. 
4545	is because a majority of 270 electoral vote is required to elect the President. And when we vote for our candidate we are actually voting for your candidate's electors. And each of the candidate running for President in our state has his or her own group of electors 
4546	and that is my thrid reason is because were states's entitled allotment of electors equal the number of members in it's congressional delegation:and one for each member in the House of Representatives plus two for you senators 
4547	The way they say it assist you is very helpful for the elderly. Some people are handicape and was waiting for an idea like this. Everybody isn't able to move around and do alot of things because they are disabled but a invention like this will change all of those problems. 
4548	In the intere world some kids can have this oportunity to have online classes in some countries around the world they not have the tecnology to do that so if they miss the school one its like they are missing one day of his life and fact even they are kids ho not are going to the school bacuse the parents not have money to send them to the school ( yep in some countries the education cost money and they not have free schools like united states ) and they have to work in one short age to help his family in my country was like this thaks to good i was alow to go to the school thanks to my mother and come her to the united states so when i come to the school her in united states and i hear students said i hate the school and i wanna be in home i remember my country and i said thanks to this country for give me free education (even in her they do video school conferencing to the people ho not coming to the school and i said wow , Even they do that for the students, and the students are doing protest to have more off days so what i try to said is always thanks to you parents for the education they are give to you and thaks always to you country to give you free education to you can be some one in you future and have a nice work and never ask why i not have this. and always think some in around the world not have the stuff the you have and always thanks to GOD for the stuff you have ( I always do that wen i wake up).  
4549	The perents will allow the kids to bring the phone to the school. So that the kids that walk to school can feel safe and protected. so that if something goes wrong like someone trying to take the child they can feel safe cause they will have their phone and the perents wont have to worry about if their child got to school safe or not. 
4550	S yes i think that it is a good and bad idea for the kids to bring their phone to school. 
4551	Are electoral college better than other colleges. yes i belive that a electoral college is better than other collages 
4552	An electoral college is a collage that helps pick canididates that are running for president in are state. the canidates are chosen by the politial party. the election is held every 4 years on thethe first tuesday of november. 
4553	my second reason electoral collages help are state out are they help pick they rights states to vote. 
4554	an electoral collage tells there president where to go and give there speechs. 
4555	presidebts seechs are very important, the speechs give them vote two keep them president in charge. some on thebig voteing states are texas,california,and florida,  
4556	so inconclusion you should go two a electoral collage becuase they help are states out by pick the right president and keeping him. 
4557	Most student will do the program ,but there will always be student who don't do the program. It nature that there will be some students that won't do the program at all ,but that is the chose of the student if they don't want their education. 
4558	The chose on have online course can go both way ,it depend on the on problem if most student and teacher complain about wake up to early and not having enough time to get every ready. In my opinion it depend on the situation the school is having ,if it the only way to have to have student to do their work and get everything done then go for it. There is no good or bad option for this. It's all on the situation on hand. Both thing have there goods and there bad ,but it is up for these school departments to know if it will help the student or make it worse than it was already. 
4559	"the driver of the car must stay alert at all times and be ready to take over if needed. If there is an accident or the wiring or technology fails in the car.  "" Who is blamed""? ""Do you blame the driver or the maufacturer""? "
4560	Maybe the teachers and principals can help do some cleaning up to cause the student cant do al the work. And if they could that is not fair if they do cause they need to do some of they other stuff like practise for a sport or some thing that they need to get better at 
4561	I think that students that have a C average should at least have an extra class that they need help in so they can pull up their grades up so the students can participate in sports or activities. 
4562	The electoral college is a proces, not a place, which consists of 538 electors. During this process the public casts their vote for their favorite candidate. The votes are added up in each state and whichever candidate has got the most votes is for whom the state's representatives will vote towards. Each state's number of representatives is determined acoording to polpulation with California having the most electorial votes at 55. Electors can change their votes for whomever they'd like, yet it is highly unlikeley. In order for a candidate to win an election he or she must obtain 270 votes out of 538.  
4563	"because even if the president gets popular votes, it wouldn't matter anyway. They will have to vote the president by using the Electoral College. It wouldn't be fair because ""Most states have a ""winner-take-all"" system that awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate."" That means if the president gets the most popular votes, it won't matter. "
4564	They all thought that it wouldn't be fair if the popular votes wouldn't count and the Electoral College has its defenders. 
4565	So if someone were to vote for a president, they would be voting for a slate of the 34 Democratic electors. After that, they pledged it on the president that they voted for.  
4566	"When people also vote for a presdential canidate they actually vote for the slate of electors. Which was why Gore had more popular votes than Bush, yet he had fewer electoral votes. But there is one way to settle a dispute of the outcome of an Electoral College vote. ""it happened in 2000-but it's less likely than a dispute over the popular vote."" The Electoral College also has a presidential candidate to have a trans-regional appeal but has enough electoral votes to vote for president. "
4567	Some students believe that we should have community service some disagree. I am about show why some disagree and some agree.  
4568	I mean im sure I proved myself correct about having to be forced to do community service. 
4569	Having cell phones at school would be crucial to school functioning 
4570	"In a worst case scenario the school could get sued by a student getting a white slip, detention, ISS, suspended, or expelled and disagree about doing the wrong thing they did or if they where given it through ""hard feelings"" between a teacher and a student. "
4571	Votes in larger states and smaller states are balanced out so the number of votes would not be based on the number of people in the states. This can be seen as a way to make sure that state votes did not compare to the population of said states 
4572	This problem could be dealt with by maximized security. There would be videocameras wherever the votes could be swaped. 
4573	A reason that I would question about: what about teachers?  Would teachers be allowed to have their phones out whenever they wanted?  Or can they only have them out if they have some free time?  This is all something that could impact the education of the kids, but I'll let you decide that one. 
4574	I think that the Electoral College is important becase it isÂ  a process. 
4575	"The founding fathers established the Eletoral College to the Constitution as a comromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualificatied citizens. The Electoral College process consists of the selection of the electors.  The meeting of the electors where they vote for President and Vice President. The counting of the electoral votes by Congress. The electoral College consists of 538 electors. The mjority of 270 electoral votes are required to elect the President.  Under the 23rd Amendment of the Constitution, the DistrictÂ  of Columbia is allocated 3 electors and treated like a state for purposes of the Electoral College. For this reason, in the following discussion, the word ''state'' also refers to the District of Columbia.  The presidential elction is held every four years on the Tuesday after the first Monday in  November. One thing that I didn't know is that most states have a ""winner-take-all.""A ""winner-take-all"" is a system that awards all electors to the winning presidential canidate.    "
4576	aliens could be on Mars and we would of never knew but they took a photo on the wrong night so they had to go back and see it again 
4577	The community we live in could be a lot stronger and healthier if we all just try together. 
4578	To begin with, the electoral college process consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for president abd vice president, and the counting of the electoral votes by congress. The electoral college consist of 538 electors. A majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the president. Each candidate running for presisent in your state has his or her own group of electors. The electors are generally chosen bt the candidate's political party 
4579	In addition, the presidential election is held every four years on the Tuesday after the first Monday in november. You can help choose tour state's electors when you vote for predident.Â  Most states have a ''winner-take-all'' system however, Maine and Nebraska each have a variation of ''proportional representation.'' Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for president, but for a slate of electors, who in tuen elect the president 
4580	It's like a hurricane for a presidental election 
4581	But athat single vote may decide that election!       Â Â Â Â     
4582	Many my agrue that, the Electoral college is there for our benefit. 
4583	we are not in a lot of debt so we should use are money wisely.    
4584	So, you might as well just let the electoral collge do the job. I mean if you want to go and vote mor power to you. But, like I said its a waist of time to do so!!! 
4585	"Most of 270 electoral votes are required to elect the president. The number of members in its Congressional delegation is equal to the entitled allotment of electors in your state, one is for each member in the house of Representatives plus two for the Senators. For the purposes of Electoral College, Columbia District is allowed 3 electors and is treat like a state. and when i say ""state"" for this topic i mean the District of Columbia. "
4586	A outcome of an Electoral College vote is possible, just look back at the year 2000 it was less likely then a come over the popular vote the Reason for that is the winning candidate's share of the Electioral College expanded his share of the popular vote. For example, Obama received 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to only 51.3 percent of the popular votes cast for him and Romney. 
4587	"Popular vote is more based on ""winner-take-all"" System thats awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate, unlike the Electoral College which is a process that consists ofÂ choosing the electors, "
4588	but not without and independent reason 
4589	That is my position on whether or not the students of the school district should have to perform community service or not. 
4590	that means the teams are going to be very very small 1-9 kid on most of the teams meaning most of those kids will be picked on from frustration of other kids not joining the sport since the c average is the ideal grade for joining sports the grade is not perfect but its the average grade for the entire school then that grade should be used not causing a big slur. 
4591	those are only a few of the reason's that we should leave the grade to join sports at a c not at a b sincerely STUDENT_NAME 
4592	"Mars has powerfull winds just like we do on earth which if the dirt gets built up on rocks it can cause a face looking shape. The face is just a maountain with craters up at the top which makes it look somewhat like a human face. Mission controllers prepared to look again. ""It's not easy to target Cydonia,"" says Garvin. ""In fact, it's hard work."" Mars gGlobal Surveyor is a mapping spacecraft that normally looks straight down and scans the planet like a fax machine in narrow 2.5km-wide strips. ""We just don't pass over the Face very often."" he noted "
4593	Losing the Electoral College can also avoid any mishap in the future. 
4594	congress should consider the thoughts and opinions that us voters have. If they wish to not do so the candidate with the popular votes could potentially lose presidency. 
4595	In the article it explains how''under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the presedent ,but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president.''This quote explains that the electoral college has nothing to do with the people the vote is not decided by the people why have any people to begin with.  I just think overall you should consider the tip and change the voting rules. 
4596	In the text ''The indefensible electoral college why even the best-laid defense of the systeme are wrong.''the quote explains that even though both systems of voting work,popular vote is the more dominant rule. 
4597	For example, the Electoral college avoids problems and tries to fix eveything so that everyone can be happy. 
4598	Each Candidate running for President in each state has his or her own group of electors. Each party (democratic or republican) selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee. 
4599	because,I think with the popular voting process way the only people who vote for you takes favor in you,which means if more people like you then the more votes you'll recieve,therefore you'll have a better shot of winning 
4600	There are so many positive things on why to keep the electoral process and I also make room for the errors of it so dont think im on a one man train,because im not 
4601	The electoral college consists of 538 electors which means a majority of 270 electoral votes are required to elect the president. Which ever state's entitled allotment of electors equals the number of members in its congressional delegation:which also means one for each member in the  H.O.R plus two for your senators...Most state's just have a winner take all 
4602	With the popular vote system,theres not much consisderation tooken in on what should really be done 
4603	The problem that I have with driverless cars 
4604	If they want to make excuses, maybe you could have them do a couple more hours of work. And for the  Because students are fully capable of doing good for their community 
4605	Well we all know that alliens are not real it has been provin many time by other scients. 
4606	I would unerstand why people would think it was created by these myth cretures, 
4607	but u also got to think about how land andother things can form tier self in to living fetures like for some exsample. 
4608	On an sunny day you look outside and u see some clouds and you stare at it for a while. Than all the sudden u see faceses and animals that you reconginize. Like one day I saw a little dolphine in the sky and I got the thinking theirs no wasy their could be a dolphine in the sky. So thats like me saying that thiers a man shaped face on mars tat could have been civilisation on the planet of mars 
4609	but dont think wrong i believe that its possabel for people on earth to actual live on that, because theirs other scientists that has proven that to most people and their starting to recrute peopole to actual go to mars. 
4610	Also their for in the passage it saids it was a huge rock formation like come on now we know a real life humae face is not as huge for it to be spotted from face. 
4611	Also on mars their is a lot of diffrent shape and sizes and holes like in the moon so its just do univers doing what it does best to form diffrent imagies and diffrent shapes like the was it formed earth and broke diffrent things apart and also land. 
4612	If u also look in the passage at paragraph 12 it saids in the first sentence that. What the picture actually shows is the martian equivalent of a butte or mesa----LANDFORMS common around the american west. to also make people intrested in the artical the put a. Huge rock formation from mars so theri for their also saying it was made from these mythical cretures called. Alliens and why would alliens want to make a human face in the first pllace if you think about it it actually make sense. For them just to attract people to a new land form that they have found that has a more like humans fetures. 
4613	So thats why i say that alliens did not make that image or a landform human like image on mars. 
4614	and if they want to decide if they want to have their cell phones on in class is not going to be better for the teachers because they cant help the students learn and what is going on in life and what do they have to do as their assignment. they want to be texting in class and be distracted. 
4615	 Only one person will always make a difference in life if they do something wrong the other person needs to come in and say that they didn't do that, they didn't text in class he/she was paying attention then later the teacher asks them a question and they don't know the answer to the question and thats when they catch them that they were texting or talking so is better off keeping the phones off or on silent for it won't make any noise and you will be focus in school more and you will get your grades up higher and will never be distracted until you go home and then you could do all the texting you want to do and never have u grades because of the texting if you have it on vibrate ignore it and continue working on your class work or homework .  
4616	This reasoning is highly probably and has never happened before.       Â Â Â Â        Â Â Â Â     
4617	If i had community service i would need some help ! 
4618	it tells us what kind of president we will have in the future and what kind of changes he will make 
4619	Under the 23rd Amendment of the Constitution, the district of Columbia is allocated 3 electors and treated like a state for purpose of the Electoral College. The electors are generally chosen by the candidates political party, but state laws vary on how the electors are selected and what their responsibilities are. The president only haves four years, it is held every four years on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. When you vote for your state they have a thing called winner-take-all system that awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate. However, Maine and Nebraska each have a variation of proportional representation. When the election is done they have a thing they do called Certificated of Ascertainment it lists all of the candidates who ran for president in your state along with the names of their respective electors. The Ascertainments are then sent to the Congress and then to the National Archives as part of the official records of the presidential election. 
4620	This is the thing that can not be changed because this is a system that we can pull up see what they were elected for and why they were voted president and how many times. It helps us how we can choose the right president or the right vice president. 
4621	Each one tells us how choosing the president and shows us a map how it works and we can see which state shows a breakdown of the number of electoral votes given to each state. This is something that can help us understand how to vote and how long they will be the president or the vice president 
4622	I think that you should do it at a different school because you are trying to force us to do community service and we don't want to do it. Why don't you get out of that desk and you do it too. 
4623	I have recently read an article by the name of Â¨Driverless Cars Are ComingÂ¨, and asked my opinion. 
4624	theyÂ´re many sensors and techology to do with the car, who is to say they couldnÂ´t malfunction, or intercept waves a sentence from paragraph 4 indicates my fear,Â¨For starters, they needed a whole lot of sensors....Prius uses position-estimating sensors on the left rear wheel, rotatin sensor on the roof, a video camera mounted near the rearview mirror, four automotive radar sensors....Â¨ and much more. 
4625	In paragraph six they state thatÂ¨Radar was a device on a hilltop that cost two hundred million dollars.Â¨  The last time I herd the United States was eight trillion dollars in debt, should we really consider adding two hundred million per radar to that eight trillion? 
4626	we would have even more money added to that debt to try to prevent it from happening again and no one really knows spending all that money would even prevent it from malfunctioning again, and lastly we would have some very unhappy customers on our hands.  We could be talking riots, people wanting their money back, shootings, killing. 
4627	Just like in 1960 when they send two slates of electors to congress but that was probably because they had the popular vote and not the elertoral college.  
4628	The electoral college is a process,not a place people might have thought that is what place like maybe a college [school]. The thing is who ever thought that was wrong beacuse it was found by the father established it in the constitution as a compromise. Its a long story lets just cut to the chase the electoral college conists of 538 electors a majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect president. 
4629	Electoral college is the best way to go beacuse like that will only have one slate of electors. But if the popular vote then most likely will end up with two or more slates of electors and personlitly I wouldnt like that 
4630	Look also if the popular vote that doesnt mean that they will win most likely they will lose the predidency for example Al Gore won the popular vote but lost the presidency over 60 percent of the voters. See having theÂ  popular vote wouldnt be the best thing to do. Just stay with the electoral college dont make it so hard on people 
4631	The people who don't like the idea usually become pessimists who hate everything, 
4632	we wouldn't like to make students feel that way. 
4633	it is a vote qualified by the citizen and the founding fathers established it in the constitution. all of the votes have to go to the electors and to the congress and then they pick the president and the vice president. the election is held every four years on the same month and day. the governor lists all of the people who ran for presidentin your state.  the winner takes all system that awards all electors to the winning presidental canididate. the governor prepares a cerificate of ascertainment. the certificate of ascertainment also declares the winning presidental candidatein your state and shows which electors are representing your state. the 60 percent of the voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now. 
4634	you would have to vote for a slate if you want to vote for john kerry. not always do the voters control whom their electors vote for. seventeen states didnt see the candidates at all,including rhode island and south carolina. but each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee. in a state creates a landslide electoral-vote victory in that state.  the popular vote was really close in florida in 2012.    
4635	Electoral College consists of 538 electors , but a majority of 270 votes are required to elect the president. Voters don't vote for the president they would have to vote for a a slate of democratic electors pledged to that person and if that person won they would go to congress and that runner would get that amount of electoral votes. 
4636	But if a tie happens the electrol vote would go to the house of representatives where they would have to decide who the president will be and senates would decide who the Vice President would be. 
4637	some kids play good for sports 
4638	Driverless cars could be the next common technology among the human population like computers or phones.  From this, humanity will continue evolving and strive through conflicts similar to this subject.  However, another choice for us, individually is whether or not to accept change.        
4639	In the article Driverless Cars Are Coming, they talk about the positive and negative things that could happen. 
4640	the Electoral College does all the voting anyway. 
4641	To commence, the Electoral College is pretty much the way the president is elected. 
4642	I think people are going crazy. People are watching to many cartoons and they are starting to think that aliens are real. People on talk shows, books, and magazines are talking about it. There is a face on mars and they think it's aliens creating them. 
4643	I think that people need to go up to mars and really see what is going on. So, we can go and show everyone this there aren't any aliens, and they are just a myth. 
4644	Their could be alot of arguments for the cell phone policy in schools. 
4645	Well that's all i think about how you should require all students to participate in the community service. 
4646	I have my opinion they have theres, their gonna give you opinionsÂ  about how unfair the electoral college is when in reality its not anything thats gonna harm you. Perhaps i think its safer then choosing someone that you have no idea about the decisions they wanna make. Yes people may no be that much interested in politics because their not involved that much. They have to do whatever it takes so our nation can be a great one. 
4647	I'm not in favor of keeping the electoral college or changing the election by popular vote for the president of the united states 
4648	Pardon me, but i would like to disagree with you. What the picture acually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa. The Face on Mars is just a natural land form. 
4649	I think students can be benefit 
4650	"With these five reasons the electoral college allows us to ""restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment of the Senate decreed in the Constitution..."" "
4651	Many also believe and say that it looks like Egyptian Pharaoh. Inaddition, people engage to the public and attract attention to Mars. So, humans made it become a pop icon and starred in a Hollyood film,appeared in books,magazines,and radio talk shows.  
4652	This is just some of my ideas, so just think about it.  
4653	Phones shouldn't be used in school at all except for lunch, because while your in class because they will end up using there phones instead of getting a proper education. They will also distract others from learning when they are not using there phones. 
4654	Students should have there phone during school because if there is am emergency that couldn't even call the office they should have there phones on vibrate. 
4655	This is very important, as we all want a good leader who will support our home state. If, for example, the Electoral College voted on a Democrat, and he won, Florida may not have much hope. Florida is a Republic state, as is most of the southern states; yes, Mr. President would be obligated to help all 50 states when necessary, but the bigger benefits would go towards the Democratic states, and probably his home state 
4656	i think that you should change the electoral collage. 
4657	"the single best argument against the electrol collages."" they would call it the disaster factor the reason for that is the american people should consider them self lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century ; the system allows much worse, consider that states legislaturs are technically responsible for picking electors, and that those electors i "" could always defy the will of the people."" proving my point making the peoples votes useless. "
4658	they did this in 1960 , segregationists in the louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the democratic electors with new electors who oppose john F. kennedy. so that a popular vote for kennedy would not have actually gone to kennedy. 
4659	First the camera captured the picture, but it wasen't clear enough because when they captured the picture there were wispy cloud which can make it hard to take a picture or to see the picture. 
4660	The electoral college is described in many ways. It is described as needed, useful and helpful 
4661	and it is just more time taken to vote for our president. 
4662	Electoral College is unfair 
4663	If you only have a couple of Democratic electors than the vote that everyone in Ohio , Alaska , South Carolina , is pointless and would only count for a couple of votes. 
4664	The 3 states a candidate needs most to win is  California  Texas  Florida  If the Democrats got those 3 states by 122 electoral votes.  
4665	Next election the voters can expect another close election in which the popular vote winner couldagain lose the presidency. 
4666	First and foremost, the sensors on the smart cars 
4667	This is for the president to know who would be working for him or her. The bestÂ  thing for you to do is keep electorial vote it helps with eveything that you need help with. It also help the president out to .You wouldnt want to go without a president do you. 
4668	I wouldnt take electoral college out. When you cant see who really is winning what you going to do then without it. Are you going to choose for yourself. But then the people is going to be mad and thats not fair. Maybe some people dont likeÂ  the opne presidemt and the other people do. 
4669	The future is near and the talk about driverless cars is upon us 
4670	"A lot of manufacturers believe that it was not so much the car that needed to be ""smarter"" but the roads. "
4671	"it would cost alot of money to get new roads and everything that is needed for the cars. In cars today we have alot of sensors because they help with an abundance of things such as antilock brakes, automatic windows and many more. in the artical it says that BMW in 2013 announced the development of ""Traffic Jam Assistant"". That means that the car could handle driving and functioning at speeds up to 25 miles per hour, as long as the driver had their hands on the wheel. Although the cars can steer, accelerate and break on their own the drivers are still notified when the road ahead requires human assistance. "
4672	to help with all the dier need that the world has to offer for the Electoral College just dont get rid of it for no reason you need to have a really great suggestion to remove itÂ out of the system. 
4673	All i am trying to say is that in my opinion if you care at all, the we need to keep the Electoral College alive dont just kick it out the system if it sates its name in the Constitution then it need to stay where its at dont delte it from the program just becauss of some stupid process you need a darn good reason to remove it not just because you feel like it thats not good enough you need to show emotion about how the Electoral College is in the Constisution 
4674	look at the facts and you will see why i want the it to stay moving and not to be kicked out.    
4675	So what it looks like a face many things have that don't mean there is aliens. 
4676	Yes, it would be cool if there were aliens but there not as far as we know there not. How many things have we thing was a face but was some thing else? For exampal there was a toy in my brother room that look like a human face in the dark but it was a pokemon. So why can't these be some thing that looks like a face. 
4677	See there is your proof. 
4678	Instead of them rules I think they should make a better rule. So we don't have to dress for gym or something at least like that 
4679	I would like to explame the importants of Electoral College. This'll explain what it is,its defenses to the attacks on getting rid of it,and finally why it was created in the first place. 
4680	"The Electoral College was a process created by the four fathers in the Constitution to established the election of the ""President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens.""-  Source 1: What Is the Electrol College,paragraph 1.  The Electoral College consists of 538 electors. Majority electorcal votes for President is 270. ""Congressional delegtion: On for each member in the House of Representatives plus two for your Senators.""-  Paragrah 2,What Is the Electoral College.  Yes this involves in the 23rd Amendment of the Contitution that Washington D.C or District or Columbia is allocated 3 electors and is treated like a state in the Electoral College. The electors for a candidate running for President has a group of electors generally by his/her's political party. "
4681	Many believe there is something wrong with the Eledtoral College. 
4682	"Even some like ""Richard Nixon,Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, the U.S Chamber of Commerce, And the AFL-CIO""-  Source 2: The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong.  They all have in common is that they want to abolish the Electoral College. However the party will get to ""select a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee.""-  Source 3 paragraph 2. "
4683	This Was My Perspective on what should you do with the community service for kids. 
4684	your happiest place is home 
4685	The system is where the electors that chose the winning president gets rewarded when really it was from popular vote. Then it picks who your state's representing candidate will be based on the preident that won.(  Source 1: What is the electoral college?)  Wouldnt you think that the reason we vote for president is to get a reward and satisfaction of your candidate winning? But no thats not how it works instead it's the electoral collge that gets an award instead. 
4686	 Next, is the drama it causes sometimes it can ruin an friend ship or even a marriage it can be that serious. 
4687	But to lose an husband or an wife a family mmbe an best friend over some stuff like that is really childish and it needs to STOP before it gets out of hand. 
4688	I believe community service should not be mandatory. 
4689	Second reason, is that every student can make an effort to keep going to school at home. 
4690	TheyÂ also can be positive in the things they do and they never should give up. Even if someone try to foolish them with lies, they don't have to listen and they will be successful in life. Many things will come in the future and they should keep following their dreams. They should keep their dreams intact from others and knowing that there are many bad persons who will try to sabotage your dreams without caring you. They have to be good enough to demonstrate other that you can do it and not to feel bad about someone else stuffs. 
4691	 Many people thinks that nowdays we don't care about school, we don't even know what school is for but we can show them that not everyone is like that. If someone is not going to school is because for economic problems and also discrimination. 
4692	On this times people are been racist with people who are poor and having a different color skin, but if they get to know everyone, they are going to take a good example of life from the others , that try go get from all the problems they have and making them thinks that they keep following their dreams without taking care of those problems. 
4693	I hope this letter helps you decide on weather or not we should keep the process of electoral college. 
4694	"The residents of the other regions are likely to feel disenfranchised- to feel that votes do not count, that the new president will have no regard for their interests, that he really isn't their president.""this quote from source 3 explains that without the Electoral College their vote won't count and that the new president won't have any of their interests. To end this, if we didn't have the Electoral College no one's vote would count "
4695	"The Electoral College is a process, not a place. The founding fathers established it in the Constitution as a compromise between election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens. The Electoral college process consits of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for the President and Vice President, and the counting of the electoral votes byCongress. The Electoral College consits of 538 electors. A majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the President.  Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for thePresident, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the President. The single best argument against the electoral college is what we might call the disaster factor. The American people should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century; the system allows much worse. Considering thst the state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors, end that those electors could always defy the will of the people. Back in 1960, segregationists in the Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy. (So that a popular vote for Kennedy wouldn't have actually gone to Kennedy.)  At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winner-take-all system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the ""swing"" states. It's offical: The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. The best arguments in favor of it are mostly assertions without much basis in reality. And the argument against direct elections are spurious at best. It's hard to say this, but Bob Dole was right: ""Abolish the electoral college!"" "
4696	Some kids learn better one on one but others dont. Some kids are hands on and others are verbial learns. When kids get kick out they do work online. Some kids do collage classes. some kids get to leave school early for work but they are taking that a way. 
4697	Principal I will be part of this program and i will help those elementary school students. 
4698	you still have to ask the students that are interested if this program will affect their grades in school.  I will help you organize this program.  I will also bring as many tutors as possible.  I will try to make this program successful.  Many other students and parents are going to help us organize this program.  This program is going to help educate many elementary school students and make a good future for them.  I will do my best to make those students successful. 
4699	also there's always others saying its eaiser, it'll be better i understand and see where they coming from 
4700	Phones can interrupt many thing like dinner with family or study time for a big test that is coming up. 
4701	Not that we are in competition or anything but I am sure SCHOOL_NAME wants to be represented as a good, cool, and fair school. 
4702	Now I know people do not always drive safe or pay attention eather, if we inforced the laws we already have in place to protect or children and others. We could make the streets and eventually our beautiful nation safe once more, becuase today our nation is in to big of a hurry, and we forget what it means to take it slow and enjoy life. 
4703	learning as a option for students who wants to finish a carear or have a good job. 
4704	Schools is a place where students have the desition by you're own. There is where students can start makeing options and try finish what they really dream. Be able to atted classes from home is hard thing to discuss but when students are able to go there is great bacause is where they have to be and never give up during that time. 
4705	School is not a principle to starts getting information about how thing are working, or what options we can choose for be a porofessional after schools. Prevent oction in schools is preposterous because that is not ducing, good octions during school.  Students who rually have the decition to go to schools even know the distace but they are benefit. that is a oction, but when they get there is alot of information and option they can lissend from teachers and other students. When they go to schools they are giving a step more every day, to them life and they are benefit in school for the alot of option they can have in schools. 
4706	Some students think is preposterous to to make decition in schools, bacause is alot of oction they can choose, and alot thing they want to be but they only have somo octions 
4707	Fanally when students finish schools they did a good job and they have more option to choose. More of they have good jods or go to college and finish a carear, and they know how follow the the dreams, because when they was in chools there was alot of skills and the crusts those over and over that was like the firts hard thing they start with, that was alot of bad action they can choose but they don't choose any of those. Finally finish with right thing, Now is fancy work and alot oction to choose in life. 
4708	i think we should help the community 
4709	"I don't like the ""winner-take-all"" system, I find it unfair that the president can automatically win a vote from one state. They need to get use to the voting system instead of winning one automatically. "
4710	The one thing I like about the voting system is that people can pick who would be the best candidate for our nation. For example, I find it a terrible mistake that people picked Obama and all the stuff he had promised in the pass and still haven't kept his words. In my opinion, I think Obama daughter can build a better system than him. It whatever though, it the people choice that they want Obama to be president of the United States. I just think he just a liar to our nation. 
4711	The bad side of the Electoral college is that under its system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who turn elect for the president. The singel best argument against the electoral college is what we might call the disaster factor. Us Americans should consider ourselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century; the system allows for much worse. Consider that the state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors, and that those electors could always defy the will of the people. 
4712	If you don't like my opinion, then make a new system that is close enough to be a consensus. 
4713	So this is why i pick  Policy 1 . 
4714	the other students should do and we try harder maybe we can get to that way 
4715	im not sayin u a bad princical and u or considering to make a chang that's good all the studets should that fun activits and stuff like that because they come to school and that we try to make a chang and that we truy to good on the test i try to do my best. 
4716	Community service makes people feel better. 
4717	The first reason why I think we should keep the Electoral College is be cause it is not a place, it is a process. 
4718	So how can this hurt other people to not want this if you can't find it? 
4719	It is fare because it is a voting decision that the electors elected as President and Vice President. To me making an election is the best way to make a decision so that everyone wont be angry at each other.  The Electoral College is a voting system. Voting is the one of the best ways to pick out things that everyone has a different opinion. For example, evey four years there is an elective going on for who can become president of The United States Of America. This system will allow everyone in the United States to vote who should be the next president. The same thing goes for the governments of each state and county. 
4720	When we use the Electoral College it helps us figure out the differents of each election. 
4721	what would happen without phones in the world, 
4722	we need to appreciate what the humankind has given us and use it. 
4723	but us as a nation we can do something about it or even change the education. 
4724	what i am trying to say is that we need to appreciate technology and true at times people are bad educated but we as a nation can collaborate together so that we could end this, please make the right decision by choosing policy 1. 
4725	"In paragraph 10 in the article ""Does the Electoral College Work?"" the author says ""IF you lived in texas, for instance, and wanted to vote for [John] Kerry, you'd vote for a slate of 34 democratic electors pleged to Kerry."" "
4726	The author absolutely makes no point because you still are basicly puting in a vote for the president but just not directly. The Electoral CollegeÂ  is the way America organizes the voting system. 
4727	because the Electoral college is a process not a place 
4728	The Electoral College consists of 538 electors. A majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the president. With that being said that is just like saying you are choosing a president by the most popular votes. 
4729	If phones are used in class, they may get a warning or be taken away by the teacher. When taken by the teacher, they may receive their phone after the class period. 
4730	People think that online classes will give the student benefits. They also think that the benefit of taking online classes, is to give the students more opportunity to learn. 
4731	Schools are meant for students to learn on other subjects. If a student takes classes in school they will have the opportunity to learn much better. 
4732	In my opinion, I think driverless cars could simply change the world, i don't see many negative aspects of the idea of trying to make a car that a human doesn't need to drive. 
4733	It is a hard process to go through in order to be a candidate and get voted to be president because people have the right to choose who they want and why they want the person to be president. Some reasons why people want the person to be president are because of the things there going to do like make the country better or improve the government while they are in charge for four years. Reasons why they might not want to choose the person as a president could be because of many reasons. Source two states how some voters do not vote for the president but vote for the slate of the electors who in turn have to elect the president. 
4734	Most voters that end up in swing states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign as it states in paragraph twenty. 
4735	But, big states lose virtue by population. For example Obama who won the vote only got twenty nine electoral votes out of the state of Florida. In Wyoming he only got three electoral votes so this means that larger states get payed more attention than the smaller states do. 
4736	Community service is a nice way to helps out . Helping out the community can get you far in life 
4737	The winner take all method of awarding electoral votes induces the canidates as we saw in 2012's election 
4738	The electoral college method is a process that consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for the President and the Vice president, and the counting of the electoral votes by Congress. This means that that people are not directly voting for who they want to be president but voting for an elector that then places a vote. The founding fathers established it in the Constitution as a comprimise between election of the president by a vote in Congress and election of the president by a popular vote of qualified citizens. The Electoral College consists of 538 electors, and a majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the president.  But the other process of voting for a president is what we have now, it is called the popular vote, in which people go to a place where there are machines that you can place your vote for the president you want elected, the person with the most votes becomes the president of the United States and the person that lost the popular vote is elected vice president. 
4739	If it was formed by aliens, Where did the aliens go? 
4740	"Where did they come from? How do you know for sure that aliens exist there has been no sightings of ""Aliens"". Nothing can live on Mars. If so why are they not still there. "
4741	They only sent it out to attract attention to NASA. When it did it got way to out of control. 
4742	"""Wyoming, representating 500,000 voters, would have as much asthe 55 representatives from California, who represents 37 million,"" Says Bradford Plumer in paragraph 12. That makes no sense at all. Why would a smaller state with a smaller population have more votes than a bigger state with a larger population? That is unfair to the citizens of the United States and is unfair in the election "
4743	Now the eletoral collage is good for keeping track of votes but now most of the voting nowadays most of the voting is done off an eletronic device of some sort. 
4744	This has happened before in 2000. In 2012 election, for Obama he received 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to 51.3 percent of the popular votes cast for him and Romney, the Republican nominee for president in 2012. electoral votes arenon a winner-takes-all basis. A tie in the nationwide electora vote is possible because the total number of votes 538 is an even number. 
4745	"It work for the founding fathers George Wsahington, Thomas Jefferson, And Benjamin Franklin. Like they old Quote ""if it ani't broke don't fix it."" "
4746	That is why you should use Policy 1.  
4747	Another strong point is to give back. 
4748	How many kids do community service in your school? A lot of kids in my school do community service at school. 
4749	Many teens struggle with passing the lenglthy test to get your license. 
4750	i think that the congress is making a good dicision on keeping it this way to elect the presedent. so if you think the same good. because thats one way our socity is a step closer on becoming the perfect socity. do you think so?    
4751	"Say your close to a wreck, the ""driverless car"" will alert you saying it needs you to drive around the wreck. do you really want a non driverless driverless car? I know iI do not. "
4752	If it is watching the driver how is it watching the road? It cant do both at once. This is absurd. This car is just not as good as they made it out to be, in my opinion. 
4753	Secondly the ability to benefit from home with no distraction is more cable then being in a school setting with distraction. 
4754	Under the 23 Amendment of the constitution, the district of columbia is allocated three electors and treated like a state for pupose of the Electoral college 
4755	the Electoral College has far less flaws than the vote by the general population. 
4756	We can help them, we have to talk to them, we have to teach them how to help other people 
4757	We have to tell them, you have to help other community next time. In my country, when other person help you, next time you have to help them back too. We love to help another community 
4758	We need to help other community, we don't care if they going to help us or not. 
4759	If we help them first then they know who help them. Next time they going help us back too. We have to help them first. 
4760	In United states, they don't need for help. they know how to do something, they know to make something nice and strong before they can help other community. They just help other community. who is the poor family, They give food, they give rice, and they give all of stuff they have. They love to help other community 
4761	and they dont have time to attend to school because of their schedule.  
4762	that could be a problem for them since they could have kids and have to take care of them and being able to study from their houses it's a great a option for them. 
4763	sometimes students dont have transportation because of their location or maybe they don't even have school in the area, and online classes it's an good advantage for them and good opportunity to study. 
4764	Now then lets take a dive into what your pending decision would impact upon us.  
4765	I truly have no opinion on the electoral college and whether or not to keep it, but as this topic insists I must write my own opinion to you and here is what I think. Even with this article sort of informing me on this topic I still seem to have a misunderstanding (or no understanding) of what the Electoral College really is or what it does. Perhaps this is because of the lack of information I'm given about our government, or perhaps its because what the electoral college does is quite irrelevant to me and my fellow peers. 
4766	"So we can still vote for President and also Vice President. The Electoral Collage consists of 538 electors. Majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the President. Under the 23rd Amendment of the Constitution, the District of Columbia is allocated 3 electors and treated like a state puposes of ElectoralCollage.  Each candidate running for President has his or her own group of electors. The presidential election is held every four years on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. You vote for President because when you vote for your candidate you are actually voting for your candidate's electors. Most states have a ""winner take all"" system that awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate.  After the presidential election, your governor prepares a ""Certificate of Ascertainment"" listing all of the candidates who ran for President in your state along with with the names of their respective electors. Your state's Certificates of Ascertainments are sent to the Congress and the National Archives as part of the official records of the presidential election.  The Electoral Collage is windely regared as anachronism, a non-democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be overruled by declaring the candidate who receives the most popular votes the winner. But each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party nominee and that trust is rarely betrayed however it is entirly possible that the electoral vote will not win the national popular vote. The Electoral Collage avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast. For example Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992 both had only 43Â  percent plurality of the popular votes, while winning a majority in the Electoral Collage 301 and 370 electoral votes respectively.    "
4767	Also the satate senators can be bribed by one or the other candidates running for president. This candidate could have the worst plans for the next four years and all because he cheated to win. This could cause riots and uprawrs around the United States.  
4768	The electoral college is a process,not a place. are founding fathers established it so that congress and election of the president by popular vote of qualified citizens. The Electoral college consists of the selection of the electors where they vote for the president vice president an the counting of the electoral votes by congress. thew number of electoral college consists of 538 electors. majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the president 
4769	So to rap it all up it can be argued that the electoral collge method of selecting the president may turn off pontenial voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying for their state. voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election 
4770	Yes some students misuse their ability to use phones but you shouldn't everyone. 
4771	the Electroal College consists of 538 electorals. Say the article only 270 eletroals are required to elect the president. In the article the system allows for much worse, but wrose as the election crisis in a century? Well i think so! 
4772	The Driverless people can cause problems. 
4773	Many People dies in car accident. People have to follow rules, so they can survive. If the cars is on over speed, then it can cause big accident and lot of people can died. 
4774	People don't wear the seat belts if they don't, then it can cause big problem , people have to wear seat belts. Another thing is Deaths, some people's dont the rules, sometime they drink and drive, if they sleep while driving it can hit somebody. 
4775	The Bridges, if the bridges are week, then it will break, so don;t drive on the week bridges. Another thing is that people like to drive fast and they just drive in the red light. One more thing is traffic jam, in traffic jam people like to hurry, so they hit on another cars. 
4776	People can safe their life by drive slowly or drive in the speed limit. People neet to follow rules like wear seat belt and don't drink and drive, and it help him and others. Another thing is don't break singnels, if they did, then the police will catch you and give you ticket for breaking rules, so always follow rules and it will cause less deaths and accidents. 
4777	There are many ways to perform community service. 
4778	In addition,i am not saying that the  Electoral College is right in everything because  Electoral College has its difficulties too,just like choosing the popular vote for the President. for example 
4779	". . . their difficulties are that ""Under the Electoral college system,voters vote not for the President,but for a slate of electors,who in turn elect the president. If you lived in texas,for instance, and wanted to vote for [John] Kerry, you'd vote for a slate of thirty four Democratic electors pledge to Kerry. On the off-chance that those electors won the statewide election, they would go to congress and Kerry would get thirty four electoral votes. Who are the Electors? They can be anyone not holding public ofice."" so that is pretty bad but yet choosing you own President would'nt be okey neither because it would be harder and no one can give Presidents the ideas and the presidents would have to come up with the ideas alone.  "
4780	Though some places dont support online classes, there always other places to try out at that may offer similar classes to those you want to attend online, and they might have better benefits than those at a different school. 
4781	If you ever plan on attending a online class, always check the price compared to going to the campus or school in person. This can help you think about which classes to take and at which place. 
4782	As a note though, always check to see if the class is very flexible, and this is due to being able to have time to make up for what you miss. 
4783	 Joe and I have different belifes, although I agree with him on this one. Only because, there are already Martin Messas around Cyndonia. But there aren't any like this thats has ever been seen before. I also think that all theses UNmasking face on mars are created by aliens or martins only because, the name Martin Messa. The Martin must come from the word Martian so they must have some typr on relation going on. 
4784	Only beaucse we have no proof that aliens exsist either. I quit frankly think that this all rubish, but tbis is also my opianion i could be wrong. No one has proof of anything that has happened on mars. 
4785	But then at the same time i still do agree with Joe, but at the same time i do not beileve with Joe. I know you are wondering why i am saything i agree then turn arounf and say i don't . 
4786	Well once again here is why i do agree and don't agree. i agree becuase it make scence that out of nowhere there is an unkown figure of a face on mars, but at the same time we do not know who did it. So we jump top conclusions that it ahd to be an ailen . But we have nop prrof that an alien is rwal and we have no proof that any of thid is real. 
4787	But these are just my opinion on hoe i feel aboiut this so i could be wrong i could be right, but unti we find out we have to continue to make obsevations on this until we find out the truth. So yeah that is how i feel on ths situation.        
4788	The smart car is a great idea by google but personally I feel that they should just keep that idea to themself 
4789	I believe that we should only get in trouble when using our cell-phones is when we are using it during class. But besides that we shouldn't be getting in trouble just by using it during lunch. 
4790	Obviously the president who has apppeared more times on television or at meetings will win. This method screams unfairness. Whichever candidate has more money and funding will obviously become more popular, even if their intentions as president arent as good as the qualities the other candidate's are. 
4791	Some people say that the voice of the people in America is the most important and it really is. What is the point of being in charge of a country where no one is happy and everyone wants to get rid of you? By this standing pount, many people say its critical to use populartiy vote but as i stated before, whoever has more funding will win. But its also unfair to those who have less access to media. Whichever president they hear more about is the one they will unconsiously choose. Or some will rely on the trusting of their party ie. democratic or republican. 
4792	Both methods are extremely unfair by themselves, so we should not sigle out a voting process. 
4793	The way we have it now works perfectly well and should not be changed in my opinion. Taking the overall amount for all the different categories seems like the perfect solution. This way you get an opinion from those in congress, those in the senate, those in the Electoral College and most importantly the voices of the people.    
4794	that would mean that every one in the United States would vote who they want and it be sent to the capital to see whos victorious. Popular vote has no process or stragey or base plan to vote , and what if states dont like this idea so they revolt against the goverment. states might get together with there senate and riot in order to stop this. 
4795	Then swing states help us in the electoral college with dividing the points to the cadidates. 
4796	Help with the winner-take-all system, it just the oppisite of it. 
4797	The cars so far still need a driver for some of the things. The car can do the steering. That sounds easier than it is. It is realiy hard, it just take some time. Driverless cars are possible. The cars so far still need a driver for some of the things. The car can do the breaking. That is sounds easier than it is. It is realiy hard. 
4798	The form can not be life like or be alien like due to the amount of information and facts that NASA has to back up its ideas. 
4799	The conspiracy theorists don't have as many facts as NASA to back up their information and ideas. NASA has majority of the information and facts which over rules the conspiracy theorists information and facts. 
4800	Its equal rights and justice. 
4801	The single best argument against the electoral college is what we might call the disaster factor. The American people should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisism in the century; the system allows for us much worse. Consider that state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors, and that those electors could always defy the will of people. Back in1960.    
4802	Why do we need a Electoral College 
4803	Whats wrong with it 
4804	5 reasons why we choose a president 
4805	We have to find out whats going on with this Electoral College. If we don't something might happen. We will find the truth about the Electoral College. 
4806	Whats wrong with Electoral College? 
4807	Voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president ,  according to paragraph 10 . Again they said if you live intexas, for instance, and wanted to vote for John Kerry, you'd vote for a slate of 34 Democratic electors pledged to Kerry. All the votes that people vote for really aren't voting, there just voting for the slate electors. The electors choose which one they will vote for, but is that any fair, for the people, they make a choice to vote, there not being forced to vote by command. People like to vote because they want a new leader or, for instance, somebody like President Barack Obama. He is going into his 6 year as president.  
4808	Why do we need a Electoral College? 
4809	The Electoral College consists of 539 electors, according to paragraph 3.  A majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the president. The Electoral College process consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for the president and vice president, and the counting of the electoral votes by congress. The Founding Fathers established it in the Constitution as a compromise between election of the president by a vote in congress and the lection of the president by a popular vote of qualified citizens.  
4810	What are the reasons why we choose a president? 
4811	 The reasons why we choose a president is because of the swing states, and the big states. Swing states is a winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes induces the candidates as we saw in [2012's] election to focus their campaign efforts on tht toss-up states. Next is the Big States, the electoral college restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states (by population) lose by virture of the mal-apportionmentof the senate. The Big States are like : Texas, Californina, and Florida. But this doesn't annoy me because people still have a chance to vote whether or not, the votes don't to the congress.  
4812	In Conclusion, Electoral College is a well-known thing when to choose a president or vice president or even governer 
4813	Elecotral College is important, you can say that because maybe you agree to it but i still don't 
4814	because the votes aren't really going to the votes to the congress, the votes really go to the slate of governers or the senate but the the senate or congress are really the real people that can choose the president or vice president.    
4815	And yet, it is still how president after preseident is put into the Oval Office- sometimes wrongly as explained above. 
4816	YouTube and googal is the one of popular online and video conferencing in this generation because every body need YouTube for learning 
4817	''THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE IS A PROCESS NOT A PLACE THE FOUNDING FATHERS ESTABLISHED IT IN THE CONSTITUTION AS A COMPRIMISE BETWEEN ELECTION OF THE PRESIDENT BY VOTE IN CONGRESS AND ELECTIION OF THE PRESIDENTÂ  BY A POPULARÂ  VOTE OF QUALIFIED CITIZENS''.THIS PROCESS CONSISTS OF 538 ELECTORS. ALSO EACH CANDIDATE RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT IN YOUR STATEHAS HIS OR HER OWN GROUP OF ELECTORS. 
4818	"""WHAT HAVE RICHARD NIXON, JIMMY CARTER, BOB DOLE, AND THE US CHAMBER OF COMMERCE, AND THEIR AFL-CIO ALL, IN THEIR TIME, AGREE ON""?Â  THE CORRECT ANSWER IS ABOLISHING THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE. "
4819	"ONE OF THE TINGS THAT IS WRONG WITH IT IS ""UNDER THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE SYSTEM , VOTERS VOT NOT FOR PRESIDENT, BUT FOR A SLATE OF ELECTOERS, WHO IT Turn elect the president.  "
4820	these Are what the electoral colleges is and the goods and bads.    
4821	There are several reasons, well first i dont know what this people are doing maybe they are being paid to choose the president it dosen't mean enything that they got more ethoes than the rest of the state 
4822	The school could put that time they spent into helping out the school and making the school a better place for the students so they could have a better place to learn. 
4823	Also God never created aliens as it states in the begining of Genisis in the bible. 
4824	"Then on April 8, 2001 the space station found to ""face landform"". Though due to the pixalation i think that it did not look like a face anymore. The scientists should have put each photo in the same pixilation because it would have been an accurate demonstration over the years and how this rock landform has formed.  "
4825	that they shouldnt do the voting thing if they are gunna end up chooseing it them selfes. in the passage it said that, the electoral college is made up of 538 electors and only the majority vote is 270. 
4826	what if the persident that the senator choose didnt know how to work stuff and had bad disitions, the election is every four years on a tuesday on a november. thats a pretty long time if you ask me. I think that half of the people votes dont cont cause of the sentors that choose 
4827	but i dont think it matters because in the end it would be chosen by the people that wanted that president not what the senators wanted.    
4828	My opinion about this change is a good idea 
4829	the policy they should really change is having to no wear uniform to school because its such a distraction to me an much others. 
4830	"Civilians demand to take charge on whats right for them or what will be in charge of them throughout the next four years. ""Voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election...."", said richard A. posner in source three. "
4831	"After the presidential election, your governor prepares a ""certificate of Ascertainment"" listing all of the candidates who ran for president in your state along wit the names of their respective electors. "
4832	There are five reasons for retaining the electoral college despite its lack of democratic pedigree:  1. Certainy of outcome 2. Evryone's president 3. Swing states 4. Big states 5. Avoid run-off elections  
4833	The electoal college process consists of the selection of the electors,meeting of the electors where they vote for president, and the counting of the electoral votes by congress, Stated by Source 1 #2. Picking the right electors is very important because they are basically picking our president. The electors are generally chosen by the candidate's political party, but state laws vary on how he electors are selected and what their responsibilities are. As stated in Source 3,The electoral college is widley regarded as an anchorism wich is a non democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be overruled byÂ  declaring the candidate who recives the most popular votes the winner, but the electoral college is not democratic in a modern sense. The electoral college in my opinion is organizing and put together, it is way more stable and puts our country in the right place. 
4834	Citizens in anyway possible can not vote for the presidential candidate they are in favor of so that means society will not be content for four years and changes will be made that will make their lifes harder and some priveliges will be taken away if the presidents intentions are not helpful. Society will be living in hell in other words. 
4835	If it was an alien the head would have anteanas on it and the head would be shaped differently than it is. Even though it was eighteen long years after the Viking Mission ended that we took a photo of the head doesn't mean that is is and alien. 
4836	"It's not easy to find the Cydonia. We just don't pass over the ""Face"" very often. But on April 8,2001 a cloudless summer day in Cydonia MGS went for another look. This time we rolled the space craft 25 degrees to center the face in the field. Malin's team captured an extradinary photo using the camera's absolute maximum resolution. "
4837	Here is my evidence to what I think about this situation. 
4838	So this is my opinion on what I think of the Face on Mars. 
4839	Electoral Collage the process,not a place Founding fathers established it in the constitution as a compromise between elections of the president by a vote in congress and election of the president by the popular vote of qualified citizens.  Electoral Collage consis of the selection of the electors where they vote for president and vice presidence,and the counting of the electoral votes by the congress. The  Electoral Collage consis of the 538 electors. A majority of 270 electoral votes is required to select the president. Under the 23rd Amendment of the constitution, the district of Columbia is allocated 3 electors and treated like a state for purposes of the  Electoral Collage .Each canidate running for president in our state has his or her own group of electors. The electors are chosen by the canidates political party,but states laws vary on how the electors are selected and what their responsibilities are.  President election is held every few hours on tuesday after the first monday in november. You help choose our states electors when you vote for president because when you vote for president because when you vote canidate you are actually voting for your canidates electors. After the presidential election your governor prepares a certificate of ascertainment listing all the candidates who ran for presidenty in your stare along with the names of their respective electors. The certificate of ascertainment declares who the winning presidential candidate in your state and shows which electors will represent. Your state certificates of ascertainments are sent to the congress and the national archives as part of the official recors of the president election. 
4840	Could not having friends also be a problem? Not having friends could also cause depression in the teen which could lead into showing less effort and not having motivation to complete assignments 
4841	The electoral college avoids the problem of elections 
4842	but not all students 
4843	Statistically, bullying has reduced significantly in the past 30 years, yet these are the years when online school was introduced. No one can justify targeted and repetative bullying, however, light teasing can actually create thicker skin and teach students how to cope with people being rude to them and how to handle constructive or not so constructive critisism which are heavily prevailant in the real world 
4844	whatever you do is up to you 
4845	There just there to get money and sit on there butts 24/7 and do nothing but make poor decisions as a reference to our president. 
4846	The most worrying is the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote. Then in that case the election would be thrown to The House of Representatives , where state delegations vote on the president. There shouldnt be a tie and having to be thrown in to The House of Represntatives 
4847	The president shouldnt be selected by valets and posters. they should be picked based apone what there capable of and how they can change the owrld and make it a better and safer place 
4848	The president we have now didnt come with its benifites. 
4849	Each presidential election occurs every four years. Candidates enter in election competing against each other,'' the people'' watch if the candidate will be worth a president. Candidates will be eliminated one after another till there is only one winner. 
4850	Electoral college is a main process that is need to be able to make freedom for the citizens.    
4851	Every four years a new president is elected to run the United states of America. Which is caried out by a process called Electoral College Process. It is a meeting of various electors,in where they vote for President and Vice President. 
4852	Sometimes when children get kick out of school they do Community Service. 
4853	, and i think that will help most of them do right. 
4854	I think Community Service will keep some of them out of trouble. 
4855	i believe that smart cars, or driverless cars, are a thing of the future. only the future. 
4856	I hope you make your mind to say yes but whatever you choose I will still be happy with it. 
4857	Most people as they get older become more stubborn.  
4858	They also could be talking to someone very important. Like a cousin from another state or someone from a different school. 
4859	Students now a days think its cool to be carrying a cell phone so of course they're gonna be showing it to there friends or giving each other numbers. 
4860	I will and in from he section it says from television this idea was brought up. If it is from that television is not always right. Especially when it comes to safety. Safety is nouthing to play around with or to toy with. It is a prevention of lot lives and or injeries.  
4861	I just heard that you are trying to decide on a very big topic. I thought i would wright you a letter to let you know what I think. 
4862	I hope you take the time to read this letter and her what i have to say. 
4863	That's not very perfessional at all. what's the point of having electoral college if they do not show up. Thats a horrible look for not just you but them too. Either yall need to get a understanding or move on up to popular voting. 
4864	I have a question. When citizens vote in electoral college why do their votes go straight to the candidates and not the president? 
4865	Sound very fishy if you ask me. This is about the president of our country and it's not being taken seriously. 
4866	I think that people work hard enough to get into sports already.  Getting a B average can be difficult.  Students need time to practice sports too.  I agree that students need to have good grades to play sports.  Part of the reason is because most students right now would not be able to play because they have a C average. 
4867	Technology is really advanced! 
4868	It would make more sense if the states awarded both sides of the vote if it was a close win for one side or the other, but they would award the true winner with more votes than the narrow loser 
4869	n my opinino i think its stupid that you have to vote on the population , aka a president cant just have a state like florida or ct just have a state like florida or cali 
4870	now its true that the presidental election is very importantÂ  but it shouldint have to be taken like this . the presidents always pick the states with the most population or points. 
4871	the state is not the points the people are 
4872	most states dont have any campanie ads any where cuz they know that they dont hav e much points .other parties like green party and the tea party they should be more out htere the just demo anf rep 
4873	othere parties are imoprtant to like the green party is one of the best ones im my opionio but they have that winner take all system. t most people diagree with the system in place but they cant do nothing. larger states get more attention then the smaller states because the president needs more points . the states not might be bigger in size but population may be bigger . 
4874	Also, if a popular vote was how the president and vice president were decided, not as much people would pay attention to voting 
4875	because voters have less incentive to pay attention to the campaign of the people running for president and vice president. 
4876	Some belive that the electoral college is a good idea Because of the voting way in the electoral college system voters vote not for the president but for a slate of electors. which is good because people need to have a leader of there state and that leader shows them which president is really good for whta they do. Presidents talk about what they are gonna do to help the country and the slate elelctors define what the presidents are gonna do to help out that certain state. Then the people of the state vote there slate electors for good reasons. The electoral system should stay around alot longer the system is just rigt for voting. 
4877	"some say this is far but others believe the ""proportional representatin"" system, the system that the state governor prepares a ""Certificate of Ascertainment"", which list all the canidates who ran for president in the state along with the names of there respective electors. "
4878	By that I want to totally help to clean up our school ! 
4879	It takes a lot of studing and even more knowledge to figure it out, but aliens don't seem to be logical quite yet. 
4880	like when vice president richard nixon.Â  who was presiding over the seanate validated only his opponents elelcectors thats not right or fair he made sure to do so with out establishing a precedent what if it happens again the nations doseant need that . 
4881	Even though no one knows whether or not if there was or life on Mars or if there still is. 
4882	The likelyhood of this theory is very low. There would have to be a water supply, nutrients to feed off of, sunlight, shelter, etc. for any living organisms to survive 
4883	because it has haelped this far with fairness and making sure that all the votes have been counted at least twice. 
4884	it also doesnt mean let it get outta hand then try to real it in as soon as possible the only way this would work is if we had some one who didnt care who won eaither way so long as eveything is fair and not messed with. so what im trying to get at is that we dont always get our way but that doesnt mean we need to shut down the Electoral Collage. According to the 23 amendment the district of columbia is allocated 3 electors and treated like a state for puposes of Electoral Collage. also Richard nixion and Jimmy Carter Bob Dole have agreed on the electoral collage and there not alone. 
4885	secondly, getting rid of the electoral college would benefit the entire world 
4886	because this nation called the united sates is a democracy it is ruled for the people and by the people, when the government descides to go by the electoral college votes thats not ruling by the people because our nation dosent only consists of 538 electors we each have our own voices. we consists of 50 states all together if the government cant conduct electoral colleges in each state then it shouldnt be around in the first, we the people all have different opinions and outlooks on the universe it shouldnt only be counted for about 538 electors it unfair. and god knows where the electoral colleges are held and if they are being completely fair to everyone their are their all ethnicities from all over the nation, is it normal people that have nine to five jobs so they understand the struggles of an average person making 60,000 dollars a year, or are they picking business men and housewives that live in suburben neighborhoods. The nation have been completely blind sided by these things its just a scapegoat on picking the right president in their eyes and not in the peoples eyes. 
4887	We had so many presidents that changed this nation. George Washington was probably the most remembered president. Washington fought for our country in wars that happened long ago. He made this country have so much meaning to it.  
4888	There are so many great Amendments that should remain the same. It would be chaos if they changed the Amendments. Plus a lot of people would have even more opinions about why they changed the Electoral College 
4889	The Electoral College should remain the same.    
4890	You are of course entitled to your own opinion, 
4891	but that doesn't make it a fact. 
4892	The Electoral College is a process, not a place. The founding fathers established it in the constitution as a compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens. 
4893	I think the best way to know who wins the election is by the majority votes to the candidate. 
4894	The Electoral College process consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for President and Vice President, and the counting of the electoral votes by Congress. 
4895	The voting system should be done like specificly, because if you setup different things it's not going to work at all. It depends what kind of setups you are making. But I think it's not the good way to make voting system in setups.  
4896	Each candidate running for president in our state has his or her own of electors. The electors are generally chosen by the candidate's political party, but state laws vary on how the electors are selected and what their responsibilties are.  Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president. The singal best argument against theelectoral college is what we might call the disaster factor. The American people should consider themselves lucky for the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century; the sysytem allows for much worse. Consider that state allows for much worse. Consider that state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors, and that those electors could always defy the will of the people.  Perhaps most worrying is the prospect of a tie in the elecrtoral vote. In that case, the election would be thrown to the House of the Representatives, where state delegations vote on the president. Because each state casts only one vote, the singal representative from Wyoming, representating 500,000 voters, would have as much say as the representative from California. Given that many voters vote one party for president and another for Congress, the House's seletion can hardly be expected to reflect the will of the people. And if an electoral tie seems unlikely, consider this: In 1968, a shift of just 41,971 votes would have occured if a mere 5,559 voters in Ohio and 3,687 voters in Hawaii had voted the other way. The election is only a few swing voters away from catastrophe.  It's official: The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. The best arguments in favor of it are mostly assertions without much basis in reality. And the arguments against direct elections are spurious at best. It's hard to say thsi, but Bob Dole was right: Abolish the electoral college!  The Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal. No region has enough electoral votes to elect a president. So a solid regional favorite, such as Romney was in the South, has no incentive to campaign heavily in those states, for he gains no electoral; votes by increasing his plurity in states that he knows he will win. This is a desirable resuly because a candidate with only regional appeal is unlikely to be succesful president. The residents of the other regions are likely to fell disenfranchised-to feel that their votes do not count, that the new president will have no regard for their interests, that he really isn't their president.  It can be argued that the Electoral College method of selecting the president may turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope for carrying their state-Democrats in Texas, for example, or Republicians in California. Knowing their vote will have no effect, they have less incentive to pay attention to the campaign than they would have if the president were picked by the popular vote. But of course no voter's vote swings a national election, and in spite of that, about one-half the eligible American population did vote in election. Voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election. 
4897	But some students don't have phones, so don't think to hard about this 
4898	I'm just saying, its your decision. I also use phones, and I love to text, but sometimes play games or text other people when i get bored and sometimes I get texts from my friends asking me what the answers are to a problem or something like that.  
4899	Meanwhile, many people say it is the best thing to do 
4900	The fact that when the face appeared on the Jet Propultion Lab monitors was short lived also proves that it wasn't a alien 
4901	because if it was they would have probably started doing test and research on it right away or if not right away then soon. 
4902	"In the passage, it says, ""psychological aspects are really a challenge,"" and they should be. There is no point in having a driverless car that still needs the assistance of a human driver. "
4903	One day in the lab two people were arguing over the face of the natural landform. Tthe one said spacecraft normally looks straight down. Alien markings were hidden by a haze. A surveyor is a mapping spacecraft that normally looks straight down. mars golobal surveyor drew close enough for a second look. The face on mars is located at 41 degrees north martian latitude were it was winter in april 98 a cloudy time of year on the red planet. The camera on board had to peer through wispy clouds to see the face. malin team captured an extraordinary photo using the cameras absolute maximum resolution. As a rule of thumb you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size he added. There were objects in this picture like airplans on the ground or egyptian style pyramids or even small shacks you could see what they were. each one finly decided on the ones dicesion. 
4904	Are these cars going to run on gas or electricity? Either way, these cars not start. A car stalls all the time, but those cars we handle, but what about cars that are driverless? 
4905	Would we know how to fix it or would we have to spend hundreds to get it fixed? These cars will cost hundreds to get fixed over and over again. Who wants to do that? I wouldn't mind having to charge it but then my electricity bill will be over the top expensive. 
4906	The Electoral College is a process that consists of 538 electors. Each state equals the number of members in the house of representives. The Electoral also select what their responsibilities are. 
4907	The Electoral college is widely regarded as an anachronism a non-democratic method. 
4908	I think that you should have kids decide on going to do community service. and decide what time is good for them to go and do it! 
4909	Although having to be driven by humans to do things like drive into driveways or navigate traffic, which would ultimatley void my previous statement on how it could protect passersby. 
4910	My reason are that maybe the person forgot to bring something he or she needed to bring to school or to class. The other thing that could happen is that the person does not feel good and wants to go home. The other thing that could happen is that the person got dirty or fell in the mud and he or she does not have extra cloth to put on. The other thing that could happen is that the person has to stay after school because he or she did something bad or did not do the homework. The other reason is that they play in a sport or stay after school but the coach or the person that stay after school had a to do something and left early . My other reason could be that the person forgot to bring a book for a class and they need it. The other reason is that the person does not have money and they need money to buy something they need , or they need money to get in train . My other reason is that the parent needs to sign a field trip slip so he or she could go to the field trip. 
4911	 Those were my reason why is policy 1 is better than policy number 2. 
4912	Would you want to vote for who becomes president?  I would love to vote for who would become president. 
4913	voting for president is more reasonable. to me thats what i say.    
4914	It would be harder to let the Electoral College pick the candidates. 
4915	"This is what I got out of  Source 1: What Is the Electoral College?  "" The Electoral College is a process, not a place."" Some people might not understand that. It also states that it consists of selections of all the electors, it is also a meeting place for the electors to vote for the President and the Vice President, and it also used for counting of the electoral votes made by the Congress. At the Electoral College also consists of 538 electors and the majority of 270 electoral votes are required to elect the President. Every candidate that is running for President in your state has their own group of electors. They are usally generally chosen the candidaate's party. "
4916	Yes, I know that there are people that think that it is ok for the Electoral College to do all the voting. 
4917	To me I like it if you all would let it be the popular vote not by some college. 
4918	Yes, I know that sometime it might do easier to use the college and that is ok, but I would like it if it was all about the popular votes. 
4919	The electoral college,they decide what we vote on based on what they think our state would choose for president. 
4920	But the truth is we don't we want you to know everything we know and we want to find any sign of alien life like artifacts and shacks and technology 
4921	These parents will be asking why and we will have to answer them the best we can. 
4922	So why not do one of them. Why not? Because your scared that your democracy will fail or not win. But whats more important you or your nation?    
4923	Automated driving is projected to be driven by the technology that it is equipped with most of the time. 
4924	The technology of the car is the same as any other technology. New drivers may learn only how to drive an automated car 
4925	These are my reasons to say that they should let us bring cell phones to 
4926	And one of are partners came with the idea of a natural structure or a mesa. He think in that because if people or aliens live in there it's most be something in there that help us see if they live in there.  NASA send people to see if they could find something in there that may help us, but not.  
4927	People got scared in the start but when they see that there were no aliens they relax and some studious used that for movies, books, etc. 
4928	And sense that day everyone it's okay with stuff that they don't understand, because they know that is just something new. 
4929	The Electoral College process is showing how to choose the right way for a good prisident. 
4930	"Each candidate running for president in your state has his or her own group of electors. The electors are generally chosen by the candidate's political party, but state laws vary on how the electors are selected and what their responsiblities are....""(office of the federal register, source 1). "
4931	Here is some information on the electroral college ,Every 4 years the presidential election is held on the Tuesday after the first monday inNovember. You can help choose your state's electors when you vote for President . When you vote your actually voting for your candidate's electors. The electoral college has 538 electors. 270 electoral votes are required to elect the President. After the election your governor prepares a certificate of ascertinment listing all of the candidates who ran for president in your state along with the names of their respective electors. The certificate also declares the winning canidate in your state. 
4932	It would also be better because the kid can talk their friends on the other side of the building. 
4933	Principal don't think twice about not having all students perform community service. 
4934	Some people would argue against the point that the representative votes depending on his or her states popular vote, but there has been and will be more of the representative picking against his state if it stays like this. 
4935	We are a country that has been falsely relying on the people and lying to their faces about it 
4936	These people should be getting enough freedom to do an activity for at least a C average. They will lack in physical skills and it may even mess up peoples dreams. If you know most of your students maintain at a C average, then leave them like that 
4937	its just not fair.  
4938	In a young persons life, they don't want to be lonely. They want to be more social and talk with friends, participate in an activity. All these things help students grow up more healthier in life. 
4939	A reason that people may want the electoral college is stay in place would be that the electors would do all the dirty work for them and they won't have to cast two votes the year that the new president will be chosen. The electors also get benefits for representing the states vote. They may also want to take advantage that the electoral college is still running. 
4940	The reason that some electors choose the wrong president are because the people don't really get a say in who the electors will vote for. They may protest and make signs to show their state electors who they people want as their president and the electors might listen to them, but overall the decision is the electors. 
4941	The state legislators are the ones responsibe for choosing the electors, not the people of the state. So the elector may be a democrat and the majority of the people in that particular state are republicans. Would that be fair that that state was to vote for the opposite person running for presidency when the people obviously want the other candidate? 
4942	Electrical cars are coming, and you won't want to miss it. 
4943	Another good reason to use them is because instead of kids talking during class, they would much rather texting or calling there friends that's not nearby. 
4944	These students sometimes get caught, loose their phone, and a parent might have to come into school to get it. 
4945	You should try this for one year and if your satisfied with the results you may do it again.  You may tell the students at the beginning of the school year that the cell phone privilege will be taken away if they don't follow directions and apply policy #2 those are my opinions.  
4946	and you might eve add more privileges if they do it right for so many years they may bring MP3 games and other electronics so that they feel almost like at home.  If any students breaks the rules they may not bring the cell phones and the other privileges you might have gave them you can tell the teachers which students are not allowed to bring electronics and if they see them with a electronic they can take it away.  If it was a borrowed electronic the student the borrowed from gets taken away the privilege as well.  If so many students are breaking the rules than put policy #2 for the rest of the year.  The next year you may start fresh if you feel like it .  
4947	In the electoral voters don't even vote for the president. They vote for than elector. This could very well be anyone holding public office 
4948	People sometimes get confused and vote for the wrong candiddate. Back in 1960 louisiana nearly succeeded in replacing all demoratic electors with ones that oppose John F. Kennedy. Somestimes faithless electors have refused to vote for their party. This is outrageous! What is this happens again 
4949	We are the that have to live with this president 
4950	the winner-takes-all system shows that caue candidates don't spend time in states they know wont will. And if the electoral college gets a tie it would be horrifying. Leaving it up to the House of Representatives. 
4951	"In source 1, they talk about what is the Electoral College & how it works. The Electoral College is a process, not a place. It's process consists of the selection of the electors, a meeting of the electors where they vote for President & Vice President, & the counting of the votes by Congress. The Electoral College consists of 538 electors. A majority of 270 votes is required to elect the President. In the 23rd Amendment of the Constitution, the District of Colubia is allocated 3 electors & treated like a state for purposesof the Electoral College. The word ""state"" also refers to the District of Columbia. Every candidate running for President in your state has his or her own group of electors. Presidential election is held every 4 years on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. When you vote for President you help choose your state's electors because when you vote for your candidate you are actually voting for your candidate's electors. Most states have a 'winner take-all' system that awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate. "
4952	For instance, if you lived in Texas, & wanted to vote for John Kerry, you would be voting for a slate of 34 Democratic electors pledged to Kerry. The electors can be anyone not holding public office. It depends on the state to pick the electors in first place. 
4953	"""It's official: the electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. ""The advocates of this position are correct in arguing that the Electoral College method is not democratic in a modern sense....it is the electors who elect the president, not the people. There are five reasons for getting rid of the Electoral College despite its lack of democratic pedigree; all are preactical, not liberal or conservative reasons. "
4954	Some people disagree though they think that we should stick with the electoral college. They think its a good way to do the voting because they get to choose the electors who will choose our president. 
4955	i just wont to write to the principal at school about the the school policy about the phone 
4956	"The Electoral College has a consist selection of the electors, the meeting of electors where they can vote for President and Vice President, and counting electoral votes by congress.  The Electoral College has 538 electors, and majority of 270 electoral votes that is required to elect the presedent. Also, under the 23rd amendment of the constitution, the distric of columbia is allocated 3 electors and treated like a state for this reason, the word ""state"" also refers to district of columbia.  Plus, the presidential election is held every 4 years on a Tuesday after the first Monday of in November, and when you choose your states electors when you vote for president, you also are actually voting for your candidates electors. After the presidential election, the governor of your state prepares a listing of all the candidates who ran for President in your state along with the names of their respective electors called, ""Certificate of Ascertainment"".  Your state also sends a Certificates of ascertainment to the Congress and National Archives as part of the official records of thee presidential election. The Electoral College is also a widely regarded as an anachronoism, which is a non-democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be overruled by the candidates who recieved the most popular votes the winner.  This positions are correct in arguing that the Electroal College method is not democratic in modern sense, but it is the electors who elect the president, not the people. When people vote for the president they are actually voting for a state of electors. "
4957	When voting through the electoral college voters dont vote for the president they vote for a slate of eloctors who then elect the president. Which is not right to the people who do vote an the people running for president 
4958	"The passage ""Drivless Cars are Coming"" have negative and positives. "
4959	it helps kids to be more disciplined, more respectful, more caring for our planet, more careful, more safe, and more mature 
4960	The third reason is that if there is litter on the ground then it will attract mice and disgusting animals and no one I know likes mice running around every where they go. 
4961	the fifth reason is that when people don't have help and they think no one wants to help them then our community would be filthy and abandoned. 
4962	I'm writing you this note to express my opinian wether or not to keep the Electoral College or to get rid of the Electoral College. 
4963	for i know if i had all that pressure on my i think i would get confused also from the pressure. 
4964	and they need to put their cell phones on vibrate or turned off but students don't want to put their phones in their lockers cause they get stolen which they get mad and they need to buy another one.  
4965	but students are always texting during class when teachers are teaching. the cell phones company are starting to make new cell phones and people are starting to buy fancy phones like droid so are the students. cell phones are very cool to have and its kind of a lot of money to pay for those fancy phones. all students are buying cool phones cause they think they are cool cause other kids has cheap ones and telling them their phones are ugly. students are mean cause they could use someone's number and tell them awful stuff and would say the same thing what they say. 
4966	so i say lets not have cell phones at school that would be okay to me. 
4967	Also teachers would be able to use is too so its good for the whole school and everybody will be happy. So i think the principal should change the rules and let us use are phones. Also so students don't use them in class teachers should collect the students phones before class starts and give it back when class is over so students will not use them in class or just turn them off and show the teacher. 
4968	Some of you may believe that this saves time 
4969	but in reality everybody has to vote anyway 
4970	in fact it takes more time by deciding state representatives and so on and so forth. i really couldn't think of any other reasons you would want such a corrupt system like thus one. this system is obscured. 
4971	i personally believe this system is outdated. i doubt this system even worked well in the old days. 
4972	I think that bring your phone to school and using them at lunch, break and other free times is a good idea. 
4973	Because as long as they turn it off at the end of the time giving then there should be no problem. 
4974	but it is the right thing to do to help. 
4975	Autonomous cars is a big deal for people in this time of tecnoligy.  Also there is people that do not think briveles cars are not safe do be in the road 
4976	The reaoson that the car has a lot of problems becouse it is program to follow all the laws, which could couse many asidents. One of the reasons is that not every peorson is goin to have a driverlees car.  That couses a problem between the people becouse people do not follow the rules all the time and aoutonomous cars will go exacli at the speed limit or top if some one is crosing the road. 
4977	I cant say we would not take advantage of this priviledge cause some people will. 
4978	Hopefully it would change your mind about this policy. 
4979	You have to think about what's best for students. What would help them succeed in life. What would make them want to better their future. 
4980	"""The Electoral College is widly regarded as an anachronism, a non-democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be [overruled] by declaring the canadidate who receives the most popular votes the winner.""  source three:  In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President by Richard A. Posner "
4981	I think the required time for community service is twenty-four hours. I think that community service can be done anywhere even in fast food restaurants such as Burger King, McDonald's, Wendy's, or KFC, and all the other fat food restaurants, but the point is not about fast food restaurants, the point is that i think that community service could be done anywhere if they let you. 
4982	If you want kids to have to do community service then they should do it and if they don't want to then that's their problem because they have to earn the hours and the points, and if you don't want to make us take community service then we have to make up for it in high school. 
4983	I have not yet done my community service because i haven't had time to do it but i am planning to do it in these next few months, but my problem is that i don't know what i should do to gain the points. I was thinking i should do my community service, and get the required points at .... well like i said i don't really know where i am going to do it, but ill think about it really hard, but my goal is when i do find out what i am going to do i am going to get the points and hours in a week and a half or less. 
4984	Policy 2 is not the best choice because a lot of children are stubborn and not allowing phones to be on campus is just going to make them want to bring them even more 
4985	But I think it is a good reason why it has to be a B average it's because if u have a B or below than a B u can get kicked off the team or your activity. 
4986	we should not be able to do sports in less we have at least a B average or an A average. 
4987	they should pick the straight A or straight B students because they know that they will keep there grade up the whole school year. 
4988	But they might get at least a  B- or an A-. Like for example lets say they got an F and the next day they brung up that F to a B. 
4989	if you look at the images in the beginnig of the article, it has three different dates. 
4990	The electoral college is a process, not a place that what i've read. The founding fathers established it in the constitution between election of the president by a vote in congress and election of the president by a popular vote of qualified citizen. The electoral college consists of 538 elctors. a majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the president. each candidate running for president in your state has his or her own group of electors 
4991	Under the electoral collage system, votets vote not for the prisident, but for slate of elector who there elect the presient 
4992	each state casts only one vote, the singleÂ  representative from wyoming, representing 500,000 voters,would have as much say 55 representatives from california, who represent 35 millon votes. thatÂ  many voters vote one party for president and another for congress. 
4993	To begin this argument, the Electoral College is a process established by the Founding Fathers in the Constitution. It compromises the election of the President by a vote in Congress ang election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens. Ther are 538 electors in the Electoral College, and only a majority of 270 votes are needed to win the election. Every candidate that is running for the President has there own group of electors, which are chosen by that candidate's political party. 
4994	This method even lost the presidency vote according to a Gallup poll in 2000. 
4995	The electoral college is unfair to voters to be honest. The electoral college is irrational, unfair, outdated and annoying. 
4996	No one uses it anymore. Due to it being completely unfair to citizens and states alike.  
4997	There are many people in college that I know who have C' s and they are doing great. 
4998	The reason I say that many straight A students wouldn't like this idea is because they would probably seem to be labeled as nerd's even more than they already, dumbly enough, are. 
4999	With kids having to have a B average and over all these years you would just have to have a C average, it would just mess everything up 
5000	This year I would like to see only the Electoral College vote for the president 
5001	So think about it.  
5002	So take this matter into consideration, and maybe even call a school wide vote on it, and you don't even have to let students use them during free time such as between classes, or at lunch, or break.  You can have a scheduled 15 minutes or so during the day and call it a cell phone break. 
5003	However,studentsÂ will not learn anything even if they feel more comparable at home. Clearly, students will not benefit if they are able to attend classes at home. 
5004	"People have been fascinated with driverless cars since the late 1950's. For example, in the late 1950's, General Motors created a concept car that could run on a soecial track. this track had been embedded with an electrical cable that sent radio signals to a receiver on the front end of the car. Engineer at Berkeley tried the same thing but this time they used magnetics with alternating polarity. The car would read positive and negative polarity messages in Binary code. The ""smart-road"" systems worked surprisingly well, but they required massive upgrades to the existing roads, but they were way to expensive.  In the 1980's automakers would use speed sensors at the wheel in the creation of antilock breaks. Within 10 years, these sensors had become more advanced to detect and resopnd to danger of out-of-control skids or rollovers. the information from the sensors can cause the car to apply brakes on individual wheels and reduce power from the engine. this alowed better response and control than any human could manage alone.  Sebastian Thrun, founder of the google car project, believes that the technology has finally began to catch up to the dreams. Before the 2000's, they didn't have all the sensors, the computers, or the mapping. the Radar was a device that cost two hundred thousand milion dollars.  "
5005	Lastly, aliens aren't real so how could something unreal make a face on mars? 
5006	Electoral colleges are where electors go to meet up and vote for president and vice president 
5007	The Electoral College has five hundred thirty eight electors. Each state has an elector for each of the members in the House of Representatives. Not only does each candiddate running for president have their own group of electors, but you will get two of your own. 
5008	The electors are very hard working 
5009	They have to count all the votes made by congress. If the Electoral Colleges aren't in Florida then who else would want to count all of the electoral votes congress. No one has the time to do that unless it's in their job description. 
5010	Although an Electoral College can cost a lot of money to build they are still worth it. The bulding of the college will also be beneficial because it causes more jobas for the unemployed. Electoral Colleges are fundamental and will help improve the state's current voting system. 
5011	"According to the article  ""What Is the Electoral College""  by the Office of the Federal Register, ""The Electoral College process consists of the selection of th electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for President and Vice President, and the counting of the electoral votes by Congress."" "
5012	But this can all be due to the fact that the electoral system was made by our founding fathers on the Constitution so it may only be natural that they support it 
5013	"Some students would have benefits from being able attend classes from home? Some benefits could be like. "" What if its a bad idea to do it ? "" , "" What if I don't do good at it ? "" or "" What if I can't do it at home or at school ? "". "
5014	If their is a tie in the electoral votes than the election would be thrown to the house of representatives, where state deligates vote on the president. 
5015	Lots of people say you should abolish it but give it a few more years and see what happens. 
5016	"Many people make ridiculous assuotions, like how they think aliens created this face on mars, even though there can be human life on mars but those are just theorys people are making. Which is when everyone starts amking these assuptions and even make it look belivable that aliens could have possible made the ""face on mars"". "
5017	other ways such as under the 23rd admendment of the constitution the district of columbia is allocated 3 electors and treated like a state for purposes of the electoral college for this reason in the following discussion the word state also refers to the district of columbia each candidate running for president in your state has his or her own group of electors the electors are generally chosen by the candidates political party but state laws vary on how the electors are selected and what responsibilities 
5018	big states 
5019	So please think about this opportunity and please let this be aloud. 
5020	we our children not adults, and there is nothing in this country stating we have to do community service. 
5021	i feel we as the people of the united states that are votes should count 
5022	Even though if the electors tie and then the peoples votes count it would be fair but we be able to fight for are countryÂ  at the age eighteen and be able toÂ  vote but still not count is unfair because that would then be the boss of are country and are troops. Also they can leave us to fight over seas and defend are country but we have electors who stay in th u. s all there life and get to chose who run the untied states.  
5023	I just feel that are votes should matter more then electoral votes we get harmed by what ever the president does not any of the electorals. Most of the people now days dont even get into the elections for that reason that they dontÂ  even matter. 
5024	But the system of working is also a good thin. the votes can be avergae easier 
5025	Like in 1976 there was a tie if a mere 5,559 voters in ohio and 3,687 voters in hawaii had voted the other way there wouldnt have been a tie. I do know that under the electoral college system, voters vote for the president ,but for a slate of electors ,who in turn elect the president. I also know that the peolpe who pick the electors in the firs place depend on the state. 
5026	The Electoral college is a proccess that was established in the constitution by the founding fathers as a compromise between the votes in congress and popular vote of certified citizens that leads to how they select the president.  The Electoral college has electors who actually vote for the presidentÂ  and these votes are counted by congress. The Electoral college holds 538 electors , but it is required the at least 270 electors must vote in order to elect a president. 
5027	"There is two sides to this picture of a ""face"" either you think it is a sing of life or it is a mesa. So, the figure similar to a face isn't a face because it is similar to landforms on Earth, the figure is to big to be a real face, and it is actually a mesa. "
5028	"Next, the figure similar to a ""face"" is to big to be a real face. "
5029	"For example,""An enormous head nearly two miles from end to end.""(1) This quote shows that the head is to big to be a real face. Like, what face is two miles long from end to end? "
5030	Â I think people should be able to choose who they want to be prsident because. And he start destroyingÂ the economy and he starts taking away things that some people need to survive or maintain. 
5031	Then he starts putting a chip in evevyones body and we get told when to eat and when not to eat. Then he or sheÂ starts to put us in concentration camps and we get paid 2 cents a hour and killed if we dont cooperate. 
5032	Another reasonÂ I think citizens should be able to choose who they want to be president is because. Its not fair to people cause that would be like a citizens voteÂ doesnt even count and the government doesnt really care about what citizens think and they dont care about how we feel. 
5033	Then if the wrong person gets elected and he or does something no one likes everybody gone be mad cause they didnt for that to happen.  
5034	Finally I think citizens should be able to vote for who they want to be president is because I honestly dont think the government doent care how anybody feel. 
5035	And The Electoral college avoids the problem of elections in which no canidate recieves a majority of the votes cast. The electoral college method for selecting presidents may turn off potential voters for a canidate who has no carrying their state. 
5036	It doesn't even take that long to do some sort of service.  
5037	If no one volunteered to do anything than the school would look bad, the community to, and no one would be a better person.  Hard work will pay off one day.  See if we do community service it could help the school, the community, or maybe even make that person a better person. 
5038	You know when you help others something good will happen to you one day.  
5039	But if you have this attitude that nothing good will ever come out of helping someone you would be wrong. 
5040	It won't happen right away but give it time.  If you are happy and have a good attitude about what will happen to you and someone else is happy because of you then you have done a good job.  
5041	The Electoral College is a process of voting in which 538 electors vote for the new president for our nation, where 270 electoral votes is required to elect the President. Which ever elective has the most votes from states is the winner. 
5042	Are you saying that America doesn't have the time to recount votes to ensure the prosperity of the American people. Is that the messege you want to project? 
5043	The technology and cars has made the developers to invest on cars. The cars have all change time by having something in common . The cars that have been used for this technology is made by google. Google its a company that has internet wireless and its a huge company that only makes technology better. The car that has been desing has many manifactures going on . When they build a the workers they all have their positions and if i would be able to work in this car my position would be the antolock brakes. The antilock brakes prevents the driver to fall out of there is an actsident. Also in the article says that having unshape cars its bad or even if there is something weird of something new they think is bad 
5044	My conclusion is that if you think that havind an unshaped car is bad or even if it looks weird dont think that its a bad car because technology its changing our daily lifes and how we see the un expected about it. 
5045	Some people believe in Aliens unlike me. We have not discovered any site of Aliens for a very long time, intill we discovered this face. How could Aliens even do this? Did the Alien just die and sit there for 10,000 years? 
5046	My space patner thinks that Aliens made the face by dieing and sittig there for s long time. He thinks that they are so smart they made that face to drag humans into Mars. Some Alien maybe had to make a sacrifice? I think that landform and the sun had something to do with it. The sun probably melted some land, or maybe it moved just right to make this face. 
5047	"The fact that ""The Face of Mars"" got popular and got out there suprised me "
5048	"I would be kinda shocked though, if I was someone at home and someone comes and tells me ""They descovered a Face on Mars"". I would defentely be a little curious. "
5049	It is not justified to make them do community service because you think they should and you are the principle. People will be unhappy with your decision if you go through with this. 
5050	I would say that if you do happened to see ANY student texting in class or on their phone period then you would probably have to take it. 
5051	I think the best way for the principle to pick which policy would be to let the students vote on it and if policy one gets picked then the principle would just have to do something about the students that are using their phones in school. 
5052	So to tell the truth it really doesn't matter to me if the principle picks policy 1 or 2. 
5053	I think that students are concentrated in their phone then they on their school work. And it would be there fault when the do bad on a test or even when they loose their phone or get there phone taken. And that's all i would have to say because it wouldn't be on the principle it would be on the student. 
5054	The college is a process,not a place. The process consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for president and vice. The counting of electoral voters by congress. State's entitled allotment of electors equals the number of members in its congressional delegation. 
5055	The college is widely regarded as an anachronism. The Electoral college despite its lack of Democratic Pedigree. 
5056	We shouldnt have to change to election by popular vote for President. The Electoral college looks like a big help to President. The founding fathers established it in the constitution as a compromise between election of the president. The collge has many electors.270 electoral voters is required to elect the president.  Under 23rd amendemnt of constitution district of columbia is allocated 3 electors 
5057	The Electoral college is one by far the best things, It dont need to be taken from us. Many good things the college does. 
5058	State Senator, We should keep the Electoral college. The process is great. There are many great things about the Electoral college. Its a big help with alot. Theres no dobut about the College.      
5059	That doesn't mean it was created by aliens and besides, we didn't find no ancient civilization on Mars 
5060	"I think it was a natural landform and that's all the evidence that i have for you, ""Scientist Rafael."" "
5061	When you take away a students exercise you could make them have a risk of death. 
5062	And those kids with disorders might love sports or other activities, and you are keeping them away from that. Wouldn't you feel bad knowing you would be taking away something that other people love to do. 
5063	Lastly it would be beneficial for NASA to say that it was aliens 
5064	it would beneficial to them because people would be giving more money to them to try and find the aliens. this is yet another reason why it's not aliens 
5065	yes 
5066	GM has developed drivers seats that vibrates when the vehicle is in danger of backing into an object traffic jam assissant the car handle driving functions at the speed limit of 25 mph but special touch sensrs make sure the drivers keep hold of the wheel. the combination of all this input is necessary for the driverless car to mimic the skill of a human at the wheel.  The car read the positive and negative polarity as messages in binary code. these smart road systems worked surprisingly well, but they required massive upgrades to existing roads, something that was too expensive to be practical. 
5067	Now that they Electoral votes are being distubuted evenly there is a smaller problem we face. Electors are the people who actully vote for our presidential canidate. Very rarely do these electors not choose the canidate based on the amount of votes they have been given, but it does happen. The electors are in a way chosen randomly but most of the time are chosen by the presidential canidate. Often these canidates do the right thing and vote based on votes gifen to him by the public 
5068	Distance learning is the same thing as taking online classes or taking a college class online.  
5069	My first reason why I think it was just a natural landform is becasue first of all I am a scientist and I'm not suppose to think aliens and that kind of stuff exist 
5070	If the principal allows students to bring cell phones to school he should led the upper grades to bring cell phones. 
5071	I think that the head was form by itself when the heat from Mars rise and it burn some of the rock and form the big head. I don't think it was made by alien because if they were in Mars they would burn when the sun come or when the heat rise from Mars 
5072	If it were made by alien then we would see their foot print or some symbol or marking that is unusual to Earth. 
5073	Some people will see a campaign ad and think that person should or should not win the election, and have a good argument about that person, but at the same time they trust that person.  
5074	but that isnt a big issue bigeest out of all the people in the USA the vote that they did made a person feel happy about themselves because it shows that some amount of people care.     
5075	So that is why this iconic face of the 1970's and 80's is just part of the planet mar's itself and wasn't put there by another living speicies on mar's like aliens It's just some shadow's that come together a little bit to give the illusion of eye's, a nose, and a mouth in the region of Cydonia. This face was also discovered in the late 1970's specifically 1976. 
5076	For such reasons I believe community service is something that should be cherished   
5077	First off i would like to tell you what a electoral college is 
5078	If we got ride of it there would be no president or we would have to come up with an idea related to the electoral college 
5079	If you look back at the probloms we had in the past we got passed them and came back stronger and improved we really just need new electors and just keep the system the same but get out with the old people and in with the new ones 
5080	In my opinion the last thing we need is to go even further in debt. 
5081	(said in paragraph 19 line 2 paragraph 4) Take obama for an example, he was the first black presidental canidate and most of the darker skined group of people got excited because for the first time in history a black man could be president,many blacks thought that voting for the black president would mean that they would better respersatition in office,so many blacks and some whites voted for obama to win. Not really paying much attention to what or who they were voting for. Which you could probably figure out that obama won they had the bigger vote. If we are able to keep the electoal college it would mean that wouldnt happen agian because it could go through the electorals they would choose who is best. Dont get me wrong people actually voted for obama anyways ,because of what heÂ  stood for but most didn't. 
5082	Primarily, the Electoral College is the selection of electors by popular vote to represent their supported party in the official presidential election. There is a total of 538 Electoral College electors and it only takes the majority, 270 votes, to elect the president. 
5083	The face on Mars is became very popular. But not in the scientist type way. 
5084	The Electoral College consists of 538 electors. A majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the president. Your state's entitled allotment of electors equals the number of members in it's Congressional delegation: one for each member in the house of Representatives and plus two for your senators. Each candidate running for president in your state has his or her own group of electors. When we vote this way, there's a certainty of outcome. A dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College is possible, it happened in 2000, but it's less likely than a dispute over the popular vote. The reason is that the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College invariably exceeds his share of the popular vote.  The winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes induces the candidates to focus their campaign effforts on the toss-up states. Voters in toss-up states are more likely to pay close attention to the competing candidates, knowing that they are going to decide the election. The Ellectoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states (by population) lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment of the senate decreed in the Constistution.  The Electoral College avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of votes cast, For example, Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992 both had only a 43 percent plurality of the popular votes, while winning a majority in the Electoral College. There is pressure for run-off elections when no candidate wins a majority of votes cast; that pressure, which would greatly complicate the presidential election process, is reduced by the Electoral College, which invariably produces a clear winner.  
5085	"The Electoral College is more like a process that is put in place to pick our President. It consist of the selection of the electors and then the electors vote for the President and Vice President. On source number one "" What is the Electoral College"" it states that "" TheÂ  electoral college consists ofÂ  538 electors. AÂ  majority of 270 electorral vote is required to elect President"". "
5086	It would also decrease the rates for voting just a little bit. 
5087	If the government had only done the right thing and elected what the people wanted, then no one would have a problem with the Electoral College. It is stupid that the government is listening to what we have to say but not hearing it completly. 
5088	The Constitution is a document of equality for the people. Not the government. If our nations democracy is a democracy then they should listen more to what the people have to say and not what the government has to say. If the government would do this then things would run more smoothly within our country and there would be less conflict. 
5089	B' s are considered above average. What about the average people, who really are trying? Can't they still do what they want to do? C' s are considered average 
5090	Even when these children are done with their homework they have free time and have the choice on what to do, which usually leads to T.V., video games, eating, computer... exedra. I think if these few extra hours lead to sports, it would be okay. If kids take the time and put in the effort to fit in sports and schooling in one schedule, I think that everything would be great 
5091	I say that because it would be choas if we did not have them keeping the voting in check. 
5092	I can see where you think that the electoral college doesnt really do anything. 
5093	But thats were you would be wrong. 
5094	I say that because without them there could be a horrible president that just made ppresident because he was good at advertising and he is paying off companys to advertise to make him look better. But i can see what your getting at because he did win fair and square but that doesnt mean that he will turn out to be a good president. That were the electoral college will come in, by chosing the true person who will be there for our country when we need him the most. 
5095	So in the end everyone wins. the people will have the best leader of the united states they can have thanks to the electoral college. 
5096	Im here to tell you all the information you need to see what your opinion of this topic is 
5097	Voters in presidental elections are people who enjoy expressing their opinion on political news, rather than people who dont give a say in the elections. 
5098	but are also not that important. 
5099	In my opinion that would make me happier if the person I voted for came on tv everyday telling me new things. 
5100	Each canidate running for president in your state has his or her own froup of electors. These elcetors are ususually chosen by the canidates political party, but state laws vary on how the electors are selected and what their responsibilites are.  
5101	It also helps the U.S by giving us a president. 
5102	The reason I say this is because we the people need a president and the electoral college helps us get one. The electoral college helps us get a vice president as well because if the president dies or some sort the vice president can take in. The electoral college also helps count the electoral votes by the congress. Those are some ways the electoral college helps us. 
5103	The reason I say this is because every elector do there job by picking the president that will run for the U.S.It also helps pick out the vice president as well like I said in my first paragraph. That is why we should keep the electoral college. The electors help pick out the president that we need for everyone. 
5104	I think that the electoral college is a certain way of cheating in a presidency that you dont want to win. When people in the states vote for a new president they're giving all of they're votes to the electors 
5105	I'm personally not into politics but I can already tell that if I was I would hate the electoral college, I dont even understand how you couldn't. 
5106	there are plenty of reasons why kids should be able to use cell phones in school. 
5107	As I read i saw why some might say keep the Electoral College , 
5108	Al Gore ran for President and won by popular vote thanks to the electoral college , maybe becasue its a by luck situation because it was two parts you had to win as President , they may dont see it as a fault on Electoral College part because it did say he won by popular vote thanks to the electoral college. 
5109	No matter how well the car itself is functioning, you dont know if everyone else is paying attention to their own vehicle. Pedestrians around the driverless cars have no control over what it does. If something happens to a pedestrian, who's responsibility is that? If a sensor on the car isn't working properly, which it should be, there would be more deaths and injuries to people around the vehicle and to the person inside of the vehicle. The minor issues of a driverless vehicle could cause a huge problem. 
5110	"I agree with this for two reasons. First, becuase it does allow the people to vote for the president or canididate they prefer. Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but slate of electors, who turn elect the president, as stated by ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best- laid defenses of the system are wrong"". I strongly agree with that except from the article I have stated. "
5111	which has a higher percentage rate to tie, all of America, or 0.00000001% of the population of America? 
5112	To top it off, people are just so wooed by the canditate's ad, or their wealth, or their eyes, that they don't stop to think what the canditate could do for them. 
5113	Just two years ago, I found myself talking to a women who needed Obamacare for her ill son, yet she was going to vote for Romney. People are just too dazzled by how things may seem, when it's just a huge marketing scam.  
5114	I think this because everybody should be able to do what they want.  
5115	A class would also be good for tutoring the elementary, so they wouldn't have to stay after school. 
5116	And when students have phones out they should give them a warning to put it away not just take it way and make them pay $10 and bring there parents that's just rude to do to someone give them a chances . when they give them a warning they should just write there name down and the next time they do cheek if there name has been writhen down and if yes then they may take it way but if not don't take it away . And just in case it fails just let then pick it up and tell then to stick it back in the locker and if they dont wont then hold it for them until the end of the day and give it back to them . okay well if your in class teaching and the phone ring then you may take it way cause it should be off it only if its free time or if let you . 
5117	i think that the State Parties wants to have a say-so in the votes just so they can feel important . 
5118	the electoral collage is a process that helps use vote for the preaident and vice president. and they count the electores votes and it is desited by congress. 
5119	and most states have a winner takes all system. sorce federal register most people dont like the electoral collage process most people prefer the derect election insted. and over 60 percent prefer it. and according to a gallup pull in 2000 taken shortly after algore thanks to the electoral collage he won the popular vote but lost the presidensy. sorce federal register a argumant over the outcome of the electoral collage vote has happend in the past. there was one in 2000 but thay dont think it will happen eny time soon. and the only reson the electoral collage votes exseeds is becase of the popular votes. for exampal in 2012 obam receved 61.7 percant of the electoral votes when he only had 51.3 of the populare votes because they based it on a winner takes all vote. sorce federal register the electoral collage vote hast to have a presidential canidet that hast to have no trans-regional appeal. because the canident with only regonal appeals is unlikely to be a sucssesful prasident. and the residents of the other regions are more likly to feel that there votes dont count. sorce federal register the electoral vote helps balens out the biger states votes. like in florida when obama won with 29 electoral votes. but its proven that a biger state gets more atention than a smaller state because it gets more attention from presidential canidets dering campaning. sorce federal register. 
5120	Like Romney he only focused on benefiting the one region and the Electoral College had no favor in that and as a result he got no gains from them. 
5121	A large state gets more attention from Presidential candidates in a campaign then a small state does. 
5122	many people out there, in the U.S, feel the same way as I about the Electoral College. Many of us feel like we are worthless, like we don't matter 
5123	it isn't the best way to do it. I just want you to think of the lie you don't want to tell but you are telling. 
5124	I think if the student wont to do it then they should do it and get offered to get paid for it because nobody would wont to give up their free time for free. 
5125	Imagine a point in time in the future where there could be driverless and flying cars. People have always for a long time thought that this could maybe never be possible. Google cofounder Sergey Brin begs to differ. He believes that their may be a start towards driverless cars.  Sergey Brin imagines a future where numerous amounts of driverless car could form a public-transport taxi system. He believes that this could one day become a reality. Driverless car production should still continue over the next several years. Although driverless cars have drove over 500 miles without crashing, there are still setbacks. Driverless car would still have to alert the driver while backing out of driveways and navigating themselves through road issues such at construction zones and accidents with other drivers. Driverless car so far can drive, turn, and brake, but there are still somethings that the driver would still have to do.  Although the production of driverless cars is still just underway, there is still much more to be done. In the future, driverless cars may be available to everyone someday. There is still a long way to go, but we are getting closer to achieving this everyday.       
5126	Some People think that the Electoral Collage should stay because they think that the Electoral Collage is a process not a palce. 
5127	"The passage says ""The Electoral Collage process consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for President and Vice President, and the counting of the electoral votes by congress."" That just pretty much showed us how they Electoral Collage system worked. "
5128	the electoral voting consists of a very non-democratic way so all the voters can decide on a canindate for whoever receives the most highest votes on,in 2000 gore had way more votes than bush but fewer electoral votes on him andthat was since they first ever voting for the presidents back in around 1888 thats a very long time almost 200 years when that happened 
5129	basically we need to keep the electoral voting for some practical reasons thta we do not know about now maybe it could be from thedispute over recent years of voting .  or we can choose a different option then electoral voting maybe instead of the canindates to get voted by a party we should just vote on a popular vote that we should rely on next time it comes around    
5130	I think people with a b average should be able to play sports because there grade is a little above average 
5131	this way it is simiple and easyer to control. 
5132	people may think they are voting for president when there not (even know they shouod be).we are really voting for electors. i dont see where it is right that thoses electors have to fight for are vote. we should be able to put in are balliets and that be it, not worry weather the electors had a good agument and won the fight. 
5133	such as, Being able to compare the presidents information and how He or She will help our society and represent us, 
5134	It also can allow presidents to feel as if they have a equal chance of winning votes, 
5135	Having election by popular votes for the presidents can make our community's can help people get together and talk about which president is better or which on they think has more potential helping out the society 
5136	The electoral college is a way to get votes from people that favor the president or has different belifes and different changes in the next president. Having popular vote for president is a cool way to discover how other people want their society. Most people dont think having popular vote as president is a good idea because they wanna see what will happen or who will become president without there vote being out. 
5137	most presidents prefer voting elections because they feel equal and want to have same rights. If most people were in positions like the president they would want to have popular vote because they wouldnt want someine that isnt better then them winning election. 
5138	People are getting worried and starting to get upset, many asking questions to the public, only to be hushed by the government. 
5139	The main question everyone wants to know the answer to and are asking is:  When is this whole syatem going to fall apart at the seam?  Some even believe the election is only a few swing voters away from catastrophe.  Is the electoral college system ever going to change? 
5140	Most would say that the Electoral College is reguarded as an anachronism, a non-democratic way of selecting a president. Like every other thing in the world, people form their own opinions. There are pros and cons to everything, even the Electoral College. 
5141	I believe that this could be a good decision but may also be a bad one as well. 
5142	there is certainty of outcome 
5143	the winner takes all method that they are doing, 
5144	They Electoral College has a massive rate in certainty of outcome 
5145	Just like the dispute over outcome of votes that happened in 2000 can happen again, because the electors are not being fair with the votes. This is becasue the winning canidate shares his popular vote with the electorals. Just like Barack Obama was elected for president, he only recieved 61.7 percent of the electoral votes compared to the popular votes of 51.3 percent 
5146	Almost all the states award electoral votes with the winner-takes- all mehtod that they created 
5147	A tie can be possible in electorals votes but, the total number of votes is 538 which is an even number but, is not very likely that it would happen.  
5148	The Face was originally discover in 1976, by the photographers aboard NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft. In the picture taken in 1976, you can clearly see a face in the landform. But in the picture taken in 1998, the atmosphere was extremely cloudy, so if there was any indention in Mars's base, you couldn't see it because of the clouds. Because of this, scientists went out on another attempt to capture a good image of The Fcae on Mars, and they succeeded. 
5149	The face still kind of looks like a face in 2001 even though it show sand and maybe thats a little mountain. but it still oddly resembles a face. There might be other stuff like this on Mars in uninvestigated areas and maybe one or two have been made by aliens or other life. We found water on Mars so something had to have inhabitted Mars atr least once. 
5150	Maybe mars was like Earth at one point in time and there was extra terrestrial life on Mars but something made them leave and made Mars just a floating sandy rock in space. 
5151	But the face that they found on Mars was just a mesa, but who knows this could be some crazy alien statue buried underground we won't know for a while though. 
5152	Like people may think yes , electoral college should stay and should not be changed to popular vote in electing the president 
5153	but i think that is best . Everyne has their own opinion in matters like this but in this case i think whats best to change the electoral college . 
5154	The faces that appear on mars is probably made by aliens or made by natural land changes that is happening all around on mars and is creating the human like faces on mars. 
5155	The natural landforms that mars is making peope think that its made by aliens 
5156	The mountains that are being formed my natural landforms are making faces in mars 
5157	Second, I hink this option for learning offer the class in distance wich a attend classes from home 
5158	because; learning more in the watch the vedeo conference, with online; is more effective memorize with the morning in not in evening, the students have forceful in the morning, but no think this is a good option for a students, not have a good benefit from being able to attend classes from home. 
5159	I don't like that representatives from each state, represent a number of voters that make a huge difference such as numbers from the hundred-thousands to the millions 
5160	Thats the only good reason about the Electoral College, when voter numbers from each state have a huge difference apart and the electors cast their own vote, 
5161	but when voter numbers don't have a huge difference apart, I don't like what the elector 
5162	The number of electoral votes given to each state is bad because there can be a lot of the same numbers and an example is, Texas has 38 votes and North Dakota, South Dakota, and Montana all of 3 votes. Each party has to have trusted electors because too me, if each party has trusted electors, then maybe a lot of the votes won't be the same. 
5163	Parents are famous and they cant send their kids to a regular school, 
5164	First reason why students take classes from home is probably because their parents are famous people and they know that, if they send their kid to any school, people will be chasing them,asking for pictures all the time or may be telling them bad stuff. 
5165	"""Nevertheless on April 8, 2001-a cloudless summer day in Cydonia-Mars Global Sureyor drew close enough for a second look. ""We had to roll the spacecraft 25 degress to center the Face in the field of view,"" said Garvin. ""Malin's team captured an extraordinary photo using the camera's absolute maximum resolution."" Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 merterd per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo."" "
5166	The school should treat students and teachers fairly. If there trying to be fair then the teachers shouldn't be aloud to use there cell phones during class either. 
5167	but they still haven't done any harm to the American society. 
5168	The eletors are the one to elect the president and not the people,people's vote will not have any affect of the election of the president. 
5169	"""270 electoral votes is requierd to elect the president"",this indicates that we dont really have control of picking the president. ""it's possible that the winner of the electoral vote will not win the national popular vote"", but does'nt often happen. "
5170	in the way that they can be more ready to start the class, and they will focus. 
5171	The reason why i though that is because sometimes at school the students they have shame to show to other the best of them, 
5172	 Also if i was in my home find new imformation and i work to much during the day then i would be hungry then i can go to the kitchen for cook something very fast and go back to my room continue with my homework. And if i have a question i will ask for help to some teacher by texting. 
5173	Below for those students that don't like to wake up too early in the morningt they have the choose to study more later since at night without necesary be ready for school. 
5174	In the text state that ''The electoral college consists of 538 electors. A majority of 270 electoral votes is requiered to elect the president.'' that shows that the popular vote is the one who wins. 
5175	is tre because without the electoral college it will have a lot of candidates that they will not get a majority of vote nether one. 
5176	Voters in presidential elections are people who wants to express a political preference eather than people who thinks that a single vote may decide an elections        
5177	The Electoral College system is old news and now that we are in 2015 there are all sorts of new things going on. The Electoral College system is just too much and seems like a hassle that can be made easier by having qualified citizens vote for their President. 
5178	By choosing the President through popular vote it is very difficult to mess up the amount of votes for one person. You can keep supervision on the voting stands and make sure nobody puts in more than one vote for one person and also monitor the people who sort the votes. People are very selfish and only think of themselves and thats why you shouldn't have other people go and vote for the party's canidate. The Electoral College system was made when thinking out of the box wasn't a good thing. The Electoral College system is unfair for voters and outdated.    
5179	This shows that with the Electoral College, not every region is going to have electoral votes. Therefore, it would not be fair for those regions. Perhaps their votes would not count and basically the chosen president would not pay attention to them. 
5180	If you do make the rule that students cannot bring cell phones at least consider keeping record of how may times each student has been caught with their cell phone and make it a set number of times they can be caught with it until they are severely punished( at least once).  
5181	There would probably be riots to be honest. This is making our country sound like a dictatorship. We the people of the United States of America deserve to pick our leaders. 
5182	"Afterall, he is going to be our president not just the 538 electors. ""Its official: The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational,"" says Bradford Plumer. some people may wander whats wrong with the electoral college? why isnt that a good idea? well in source two of mine it says ""Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electorors, who in turn elect the president."" its also stated that ""at the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters. because of the winner-take-all system in each state, candidates dont spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the ""swing"" states.""    "
5183	The second reason is that most voters only vote if they they like him or her on the way he or she dresses,talks,looks like,race,etc 
5184	everyday pelple want to know whats going on in their government and you erase the fact and make them think the electoral college is the answer. you have to go back to making popluar vote a thing, 
5185	once in a while ytheir are times when popluar vote wins but electoral loses 
5186	this is bad becuase many people like it more but only a few electorsÂ  care about really voting. whkle everyone really wants to win others dont reqally know. 
5187	you alsol need tol think of all the familys that need to understadn what the electoral college is. it is a much harder and complex method thna popluar vote. 
5188	when they are bigger and they have lees things than when they are bigger. 
5189	but it would be good for them to learn their consequences. 
5190	This is the first reason why kids should do community service. 
5191	The electoral college process deals with peoples selections of the electors. It consists of 538 electors and their has to 270 votes to elect the president. We have a president and vice president without having the electoral college, it would be useless to have all these senators. 
5192	We have a house of representatives that work extremely hard and it would be rude to get rid of the electoral college and changing elections by popular vote. 
5193	Leave everything the way its going because the process works awesome and if you mess something up your going to lose your job being the state senator, or your going to get many letters, emails, possibly phone calls of hatred and more. That will not be good for you or your business so my suggestion as a citizen is to not make any changes. 
5194	because it would put more work on the poll workers because they would have to count all the votes for each president. If they miss a few votes the wrong person could be elected as president. 
5195	I would rather them keep it the same because its simple 
5196	faster to calculate 
5197	and easy to read.  
5198	I say its simple because you just have to count the votes and make an elctoral vote and then if u have the most electoral votes for that state it mean that you won the vote in that state. 
5199	I also think its faster to calculate because when you do electoral votes 
5200	you would see how many electoral votes yu have out of 538. The majority of electoral votes is 270 so, If you have majority of the 538 votes you will be elected. 
5201	It's easier to read electoral votes 
5202	because you are adding and subtracting only 538 people, but if you are counting from popular votes you would have to add up millions and billions of votes that would be miscounted. If it's miscounted the wrong person could be elected for president.       Â     
5203	So thats a popular vote for kennedy would not have actually gone to kennedy .  It happend in 2000, when gore had more popular votes than bush yet fewer electoral votes, but that was the first time since 1888.  obama recevied 61.7 percent of the popular votes cast for him and romney .... Because almost all states award electoral votes on a winner-take-all basis, even a very slight plurality in a state creates a landslide electoral-vote victory in that state. A tie in the nationwide electoral vote is possible because the total number of votes-538-is an even number, but it is highly unlikely ....  nixon in 1986 and clinton in 1992 both had only a 43 percent plurality of the popular votes, while winning a majority in the elections .  thereÂ  is pressure for run-off elections when no candidate wins a majority of the vote cast;that pressure, which would greatly complicate the presidential election process, is reduced by the electroral college, which invariably produces a clear winner....  knowing their vote will have no effect ,they have less incentive to pay attention to the campaign than they would have if the president were picked by popular vote ...!       
5204	The popular vote winner could again lose the presidency but the electoral college still has is defenders.Â The popular vote can let peopel pick who they want but the electoral college chooses people for you to select from that they know and have a feeling would do a good job and be a good president.Â People can vote all over the world not knowing what that person is thinking about doing to this world.Â For all we know he or she could be thinking about destroying us and making a whole knew other part of a different world . 
5205	TheÂ ElectoralÂ College is widely regareded as an anachronism. but each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vte for he party's nominee. certainty of outcome is like percentage . the winner takes all basically.Â  
5206	I think a president can do alot of his own work and think of ideas alone. If he need help than instead of us wasting our time with voting for people to give the presdient ideas and help him out. 
5207	Well the President always say's God Bless America. Shouldn't the President be listening to the voices of his country. America 
5208	But, If they say that their going to do something for our country than they need to keep their word. Make it a better place not for himslef but for everyone. For instance, Barack Obama. What's the need for this unessarcy work that he has done. America is loosing their mind and doesnt know what's going on. Why is he doing this? 
5209	Plus what if some kids have after school activities and must go to them then they would get in trouble. 
5210	That would cause a lot of trouble in the school. 
5211	What I'm trying to say is that you should not tell students to do community service. You don't know what they have going on in their lives. They could be a professional basketball player. 
5212	NASA won't even leak anything 
5213	NASA won't even leak anything. Some people think that Face is bona fide and that shows there are aliens on Mars. Nobody knows is that is true because if you read the paragraph it says some people think and everyone is believing what people think. 
5214	THe story has been around for about the Face on Mars and it's bween everywhere for about 25 years and after a while of the story people started to say things that are not real mixed in with real things and people have just been going around like that. This is evidence of why NASA won't leak anything so people do not know the truth.  
5215	"If NASA won't leak anything then everyone is just assumimg. ""The Face on Mars has starred in a hollywood film, appeared in books, magazines, radio talk shows, and even haunted grocery store checkout lines for 25 years."" It has been in movies okay and they change it up a little bit to make it interesting and people think that is the true story. "
5216	But over time sand bulid over it gave what it look like in 1976. In the photograph you can see that it maybe face but you can see that it can be a hill. What are the black spot in the photograph that we see here. It could be that is that can be made on mars by wnich it from by.                                      
5217	I believe that it is unfair to not directly vote for the president bacuse it should be completly up to this nation to elect a president. The system they have set up right now is injustice 
5218	The dont need away getting nowhere if its online classes. 
5219	The dont need away getting nowhere if there are online classes 
5220	Popular vote don't seem to matter, The Peoples vote don't seem to matter. 
5221	"The Office of the Federal Register states in their article ""  What is the Electoral College?""  in the third paragraph. ""  The Electoral College consists of 538 electors. A majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the President. Your state's entitled allotment of electors equals the number of members in its Congressional delegation: one for each member in the House od Representatives plus two for your Senators....""  This quote shows how each state has so many electors. "
5222	The votes should be runned by the people and they should have a say if the person running to be President or Vice President should run at all. 
5223	The people have the majority vote, so they should be able to have a say. It does take longer but it is what's right. 
5224	They need to come and show us who they really are. Visit a town and get them your vote. The Electoral College has done some good things in the past but we should change it. The Congress needs to be made up of people who know what is right and which canadite to choose as our President.  
5225	If you are going to be in Congress and are voting for a specific party, then you need to stay in that party. 
5226	"The canadite is going to feel like you betrayed them after everything they have done for you. Just because your rich doesn't make it okay to betray what's right for this country. ""But each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee (and that trust is rarely betrayed)"" (In Defense of the Electoral College:Five reasons to keep ourÂ  despised method of choosing the President, Richard A. Posner). Through our troubled times, Congress has never stopped trying to make everything better. That is what this nation needs and hopes for. "
5227	The reason I think that the voting regulations is broken is that smaller states like Rhoad Island is a state that gets 3-10 votes and Claifonia gets 55 votes. If the only thing that make people happy is to be heard by the bigger people in life. If you where a 18 year old kid in a small state trying to make aÂ  new product that could help millions but your in that state that wont let you be heard by the rest of the country.    
5228	There was a Gallup poll in 2000 that even states that 60% of the population of voters prefered a direct election instead of using the electoral college. That year, Al Gore won the popular vote, but, thanks to the electoral college, he lost the presidency. 
5229	Changing the school policy to only letting students attend or play sports is good but bad at the same time 
5230	That is the main reason why you are going to school. If you cannot somehow keep up with any of your school work and your getting D' s and F' s then you shouldn't be playing any sports or be in any activities for the week or that period of time. 
5231	I think at least having a C average is pretty reasonable than having to have a B average. If the policy was having to have at least a B average to play any sports or other activities i wouldn't join any of them. 
5232	they are good at things for the state 
5233	the electors college plays a big role in our state 
5234	under the 23 amendment of the constitution , the district of columbia is allocated 3 electors and a treated like a state for purpose of the electoral college . this means that because of the electoral college the district of columbia is treated like a state . so electoral collegeÂ  is the reason why some districts are called a state why take this type of college away if this has such a big role in alot of things to do with the congress . with out the electoral college they wouldnt have presidents or any thing . in every election the electors are always there in every president election every president have their own group of electors behind them . they are joined by a canidates political party 
5235	u may wonder how the electors work because all u do is see them behind the prsident well the process is hard and they want students who wants to be an elector to get ready on what they are about to get in to . it first start off by the u choosing the president when u choose the president u choose the group of electors this means when you choose the president the electors goes with him or her , most states have winner takes all system that awards all electors to the winng pesidental canidate's electors . after the election the govoner pepares a 'certificae of ascertainment'. this means that that it is listing all of the canidates who ran for president in your state along with names of their respective electors . the electors go through a long process . and the college wants the studentsa to know all the things they need to before they become electors. 
5236	the electors deserve to have a college someone might want to be an elector 
5237	it wouldnt be anything with out electors they do more than just stand behind the president they do more they help the president the president we have today wouldnt be able to run for president without a group of electors . and they need a college for someone who wants to be an elector. this college should be honored to be in a program like that these electors are needed in our country with out electors we would have nothing if we didnt have electors the electoral college is widely know as an non democratic method of selecting a president that outa be by declaring the canidate who recieves the most popular votes the winner . 
5238	But I don't think we should have to pick up after other students they should pick up after themselves. 
5239	I know it is great to help your to but I really don't should have to do communit 
5240	For example, that person could want a necklace that another wants and they ask and the person says no, that person can feel negative desires for that person. That could lead to stealing the item itself, murdering the person and/or their family members, and/or robbing the store where the person got it from because they cannot afford the item 
5241	"The electoral congress, made by the founding fathers for the people to vote for the President and Vice President. Also there is a process that consist in the counting of the electoral votes by congress. ""the office of the federal Register"". There are also issues with the idea of having the electoral congres becuase the voters get confuse and vote for the wrong candidate, but today those erros do not happen. The candidate is the person who is going to be the next President and Vice President. "
5242	and there are reasons of having the electoral congress, if you are part of the united states you can give your opinion and vote for the person that you think is going to the right one. 
5243	when you are voting for the cadidate you are voting for a slate of electors that were choosen by the congress, and the people will decide who they wanted to be their president and this is all about the people, and their opinion because they are the ones who vote for the candidate and they want him or her to be the president. 
5244	the congress has some erros 
5245	First in paragraph one and three, The region where the face was found is called Cydonia and 
5246	I have done research 
5247	I think that every person who wants to go for president should go to electoral school, just so when ever the person runs for president they don't win because they are well known and popular vs the other person who is not well known. 
5248	Also if they do go to election school they could learn how to run for pesident and learn how to write speeches, and also teach them that some of the 50 states in the united states have to have his/her vote.  The out come of a person running for president that went to electoral school their electoral vote will be above average for one year and if they do good as president then the outcome for next year will maybe bet higher or lower. When ever a US citizen votes they are also voting for the electors canidates. and when you do vote that person who is running for president that helps his/her's group get elected. Every president has to have a Vice president.    
5249	Therefore my vote is to not have any cell phone privileges on campus. 
5250	Thats why all the states should have the same number of votes so the candidates would go there to try to win them over 
5251	Secondly, the Electoral College is very confusing for a voter who doesnt know how it works.   
5252	f nature is killed by our littering that means we are losing ways to find cures for diseases 
5253	i can connect this by simply looking at the picture and back couple years and to now how scientist reported no life for is on mars you will be boiled to death because it's also no oxygen so how can an alien create a face when no life form have been found yet. 
5254	in concluision i want to to say dont always go with assuptions they never always go the way you planned and also dont belive a tall tell ask the person if they have real science based facts if they check out then believe or not belive. 
5255	"So even if you thought we were lying saying ""Oh this image is a lie they have secret ones that actually show that there's life on Mars in their building, "
5256	"Second, December is when we find out which electoral will be running our state. Goes for each and individual state. The ""Certificate of Ascertainmet"" list all of our candidates running. Then they will announce it on the year of election in December. "
5257	"For example, in the passage  What Is An Electoral College?  by the Office of the Federal Register it states that "" The electors are generally chosen by the candidate's political party, but state laws vary on how the electors are selected and what their responsibilities are.."" This means that most states have a ""winner-take-all"" for the winning candidate's. "
5258	if we vote by the most popular vote on president, then that means the one who gets the most popular vote might have a group of his electors and cheat off by that 
5259	"avoid a large number of ""swing"" state "
5260	"If, in case of a tie, we due a tie braker as you will.Â  There will be a revotation process with 499 voters, these voters are picked at random in the city data base.Â  ""...for example, Obama recieved 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to only 51.3 percent of the popular votes cast for him."" "
5261	Number 2 is to solve swing states, again this is something it is hard to prevent but can be solved. 
5262	There needs to be an equal number over information distributed among the states and so forth.Â  
5263	It takes a long time to vote for you and could be faster.Â  
5264	"""Just be fair"" quotes many people everyday. In the article ""Does the Electoral College Work?"" Source 1: ""What Is the Electoral College"" by the Office of the Federal Rgister, Source 2: ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong"" by Bradford Plumer, and Source 3: ""In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President. "
5265	The first thing to remember, is that the Electoral College is unfair and needs to be changed to the popular vote because the people should be able to vote who they want to be president. 
5266	The things that go on in florida about keeping in electorial college is working for us there are good reasons and bad reason where to keep it or change it to popular vote. 
5267	we vote on the represenitive by there good ideas not there popularity. in the electoral college it consist of 538 votes and the majority of 270 votes is usally the winner and he is voted for because of his good ideas not if he is populer with the people or represenitives. in and electorial college where the electors vote in the president and the vice president which helps out the decison for the better man or woman in the white house, so the people should keep the elector college and not change to the populer vote. 
5268	the united states should keep they electoral collge because the people vote and it is won by majority rule and should not be changed. 
5269	the people vote for who they think is right for the job not just random people vote its unanimus decison to who wins. There is no reason to change the way things are going it has always been the same way the whole time ever since the united states was made in the first place. the people elect that is the advantage of a democracy which we have and in a democracy we vote by majority and thats how it most likley will stay in the united states no matter who the goverment is trying to vote in who they want but the united states is the power to vote in who goes into the office not the goverment so there is no chane of rigging all the votes so the unites states should not change to a popularity vote. power to the people is an old metaphor that indicates that we have the power to vote unlike in other countries where one man rules and the people have no power to vote for the best man to take over so in an electoral college we have all mighty power to make our own decisons to our future. 
5270	so the united states will stay in electoral college forever but anything could happen to stop it.  
5271	Shouldn't the citizens of this country be the ones who get to determine who the President is? 
5272	I mean the President has a big duty and the citizens rely on His/Hers duty as president to keep things going right. The President can make huge decisions that affect these citizens which can make things horribly wrong or amazingly right. 
5273	but? This is the country i live in, this is the country i was raised in, this is the country i love and am so blessed to be 
5274	I deserve to be able to pick the president i want, or at least have my vote be the reason the president i was rooting for wins. 
5275	Us fellow citizens of the united states only want whats best for us. We may not be as smart as the people in the electoral college, but that sure wont stop us from knowing who we like and who we think is better for our country. We deserve as much right to have our own president as much as anyone in the elecotral college does.  
5276	This God blessed country is home to millions, it might not be perfect, but it is the greatest country in the world. The people who get the amazing benefit of living here deserve to be able to elect the President they want. These people want what they believe is best.    
5277	I would like to do community service 
5278	The teacher get mad when there standing up by having there phone i don't think they will be. 
5279	The face that loos like an alien could be a alien. We don't know as a team because nobody had not unburried it yet 
5280	"They discover these faces on a red planet that is know as ""Mars"". There could be more aliens on that planet but we don't know. "
5281	A landform is a man made. A face is not naturally made into a plant nor ground. We as a team don't know what it is. 
5282	Either one is wrong nor right. If I were to see it myself then I would say it looks like an alien's face. If there was some type of other evdience then thats when we know what it is. One clue isnt gonna help as much, unless we were to have more edvidence/ clues 
5283	I support my answer and said what I thought was a right/ good enough answer for all the team and people to understand. 
5284	I think that it is scary having planets have faces on them. 
5285	these Faces were found in 1976 and it was hard to see and in 1998 and in 2001 the face got covered by sand and dust and you couldnt see it anymore. in 1976 there was a group called the Viking 1 sent by NASA. They had found a 2nd face made and it had shadows in its eyes, and mouth. 
5286	We can make this world a better place for the generations to come. 
5287	these people or voted on by inndividuals to vote for there nominee president. these people can be trusted on a high level because of there preactices over the years. 
5288	"As stated in source three,""because almost all states award electoral votes on a winner takes all basis"". this means that a person with more electoral votes than popular votes may win an election. this is because electoral votes way more in a way. "
5289	Say if the technology in the car was damaged and the car started to not act properly. That would probably cost thousands of dollars to repair. Also if the car was to not function correctly the driver, passengers, or other people outside of the vehicle may be injured. That is the first disadvantage of the driverless car. 
5290	If someone was able to hack into the car without the driver or owner knowing it can be very dangerous. It can be dangerous because they can track where that person is at alll times. They could tell if they're home or not and the owner can possibly end being robbed. Another way it would be dangerous is that the person that had hacked the car could control the car and may end up hurting the driver or people around the car. 
5291	some states big state will convince other states to get one of their senators to party up 
5292	Yes, it might be unfair for thoses who are wanting to be electors and can't because the person they are running for lost 
5293	but the ones who did win are doing what they believe is right. Just because of one big out break in 2000 doesn't mean the system will fail again. 
5294	For example: Everybody want any friend or somebody who can we talk if you do stay at home you never meet someone and never know somebody. 
5295	For example: if the student take oline classes and watch videos conferencing maybe will be boring and the studend get stress in another part if the student take the classes at schoolÂ he be with friends or somebody to talk. 
5296	For example: if the student want to play video games the student can do that and if the student want to sleep he can do that too because the student will not feel with any responsability also, if the student wants to go outside he can do that because the student will be at home and maybe their parents work all day.Â  
5297	In another part if you did not want to get school because someboby bother you like if another student tell you a nickname that you di not like maybe can be a reason that you did not want came to school but you can took with you adviser or your's parents because every body have a opportunity to be at school and anybody can't tell you anything.Â Â  Â  Â  
5298	This shows us that even the people that are fighting agaist the Electoral College are making random statements that either go for it or against it because they don't know what they are fighting to achieve. 
5299	"The Electoral College is the same thing people are trying to change because in the article ""What is the Electoral College"" by the Office of the Federal Register it states "" The Electoral College consists of 538 electors. A majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect a president..."". "
5300	Dear state senetor i am writing this letter to state my point of veiw on the Electoral Collage. First of all i would like to say that is to the people. Because the poplar vote dosent allways win it is in the hands of the Electoral Collage. so our vote is pretty much just a suggestion for them. In a article i read there was a short paragraph about what was wrong with the Electoral Collage wich was by Brandford Plumer. It talks about how under the Electoral Collage voters vote for electors but not the president. 
5301	Even though there is a great advantage there is also a great disatvantage to the system. 
5302	Process or Place? This is a question you need to ask yourself 
5303	"It states in this article that, "" The popular vote was very close in Flordia, nevertheless Obama, who won that vote, got 29 electoral votes."" This is stating that the large states votes becomes one. "
5304	Some might say that they dont know where their votes are going to 
5305	but when you think about they are all going to the same place in one factor.    
5306	this system is wrong because it is unfair to those who vote for the other president,but still suceceed in helping the electoral college vote for whatever president they feel like voting for at the time. 
5307	think about i kid who like to play sports would only have to do the minimal amount of work to do what they love if u put it up to a B kids who play sports would have to try harder to do what they love that would improve test scores for the school and help a lot of things.  and look at how many kid play sport u could make more sports so more kids would want to join the sports and then more kids would have to try to get better grades to do the sport they love it would also help no child left behind law by improving test scores so u can get better funding for your school and the funds could go to the sports so more people would want to play them so more people would have to get there grades up witch would improve more test scores so u could aford good things for the sch 
5308	"""The Electoral College is a process, not a place. The founding fathers established it in the constitution as a compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens.""(1)  ""The Electoral College process consists of selectioms of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for President and Vice President, and the counting of the electoral votes by Congress.""(2) The pluthora of just votes of the people dont really endure in the face that its not counted in for the vote of the President.  "
5309	The depate between the electoral college and the popular vote is a hard war because, while also the people voice is what matters but while also the electoral college helps out america in the fact that some of the people aren't aware of the votes and who the vote for what so also they might pick a wrng person. While also the people of the unted states of america can be segregationist and some one completely wrong just because of the the candidates race. 
5310	Students think that we should stop wearing uniforms because they are not cool like other clothes. I think its a bad idea because if we stop wearing uniforms then people are to wear inappropriate clothes. 
5311	I think we should have more exciting sports and more stuff that girls can do 
5312	The sports that I like more is tennis because I like hitting stuff and i like to play with other people. People join basketball soccer more then the other sports. 
5313	This is the reasons why I think we should have more sports and more activities for us to play more and so we can help our school be better 
5314	. I think there should be a cleaning group because if we do that then our school will be cleaner and it will help out the janitors more.  
5315	You should also keep the electoral college because alot of people help with the Electoral College. 
5316	If you the Senitor Of Florida take the Electoral College away 538 electors will lose there job and more. The president needs a majority of 270 electoral votes these votes come from the Electoral College. 
5317	The 23rd admendment of the Constitution the District Of Columbia is allowed to have 3 electors. These electors are treated liike a state for purposes of the electoral college. Each canadate running for president in your state has his or her own group of electors. 
5318	If the Electoral College these people wouldent have their jobs. 
5319	The presidential election is held every four years on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. We the people of the UUnited states Of America help choose our states electors. After the presidential election our govener prepares a Certificate Of Ascertainment. This cerificate lists all of the canadates who ran for president. 
5320	At ther most basic level the Electoral College is unfair to voters because of the Winner take All syaytem in each state, because of this durning the 2000 campain seventeen states did not see there canadates at all. The Electoral College is outdated and unfair. It is also irrational.  
5321	Why would aliens go to Cydonia and make an alien artifact when Cydonia is filled with natural landform just like that one? 
5322	Why would aliens take the time to make this landmark if they were just going to leave and never come back. 
5323	Since i was not aware of this, i am quite shocked. I'm assuming that this is just something that gets passed by or not looked at very deeply, but i willbe that person that digs down and gets all up in the business of somone other than myself. 
5324	This is offical: The electoral colllege is unfair, oudated and irrational. 
5325	The best arguments in favor of it are mostly assertions without a basis in reality. 
5326	but, either way the method of selecting the president may turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state anyways. 
5327	Some may disagree with what I've had to say but they clearly didn't think about it to much. Also some people really don't care about who gets elected they just don't care nor do they wanna vote at all and most don't. 
5328	When someone votes to me that's a good thing because we have went through all this freedom stuff and then were able to vote and no many people want to vote that's pretty ridiculous if u ask me that's a sign of freedom like I've said before and when we go through a lot just to get u this grant of freedom and people just throw it away that's a sign of disrespect. I know that me being young and not able to vote yet and probably not making any since at all is probably making who ever is reading this mad but i wasn't put here to be taken right back out at a young age i was put here to live a life that was chosen for me and when people who are to dumb to realize it don't vote or at least don't try makes me mad because their not seeing what there doing just going in there and putting what ever name down on a ballot is wrong but going in there knowing a little information and choosing the person you think would make a good leader is fine. 
5329	People wonder why are world is so messed up and they don't realize it but its messed up because we made it messed up we had the choice to make it better but we chose to make it worse see taking away the electoral college is taking away are rights to make are community a better place 
5330	and no one sees it but the ones who actually care and who are with me on this. People could show me a million articles on why we should do away with it but i will still agree with keeping because we didn't come this far as a community to just throw it all away and let people who don't care take away are freedom and rights to helping the community out and choosing wisely about are world and trying to keep are community as clean as possible and as safe as possible.  
5331	Driverless Cars can help people life more easier. Even if it can make the environment much better than before. Because now we have many cars drive on the street and they will have some bad thing to make the environment be bad.  A lot of people, they are smart. They think that in one day, we maybe making computer-diven cars. In fact, this is a smart way to make people llife easier. But this make more and more people to make smarter than this way to make people life easier.  Then they find a new way to developed driver's seats and they have lights. It can help them drive on the road at night and make people to be safety. 
5332	And for me, Policy 1 is the best choice among all of the choices that the principle would have. For students, having Policy 1 could be nice. I think they would really appreciate it if they would be having that policy. 
5333	But, students must know their limitations whenever they use their phones or gadgets inside the campus. 
5334	critics may say student go online to study what they learned, but they won't do online schooling. 
5335	if you found a pepple that looked like a face. Would you think that humans were once the size of a pepple. Or that if you heared that chocalte milk comes from brown cows would you belive it . 
5336	If aÂ  system similar to the Electoral Collage was established you could use majority to dicide on mexican food. 
5337	Reason being is that , youd be hipocrytical , saying everyone has a right but you wouldnt let citizens pick who they would like to have run for president . People , would loose trust in the U.S if they didnt get a chance to atleast vote for president , everyone would be against U.S and most likely leave . Even if the people who voted for the future president theyd like didnt win they still will be satisfied enough , because they triedÂ  . 
5338	When future presidents go up for election they become nervous , start to sweat , start to think twice about what they wanna say ,how are they gonna propose what to say , and to think are they really gonna keep their promise ?Â  
5339	To know what to say , to bring people in , to share his/hers thoughts to change the world we live in . If congress were to change that , they wouldnt get a chance to share all there ideas with us , to get to know us as a family, to what we would like to help others . Without there annoying pep talks how do we know they dont wanna ruin the world ? 
5340	but its worth standing there or watching it on telivision to hear , to feel the excitement of there ideas to help the low class , to help every class not evan the low class , its everyone to help everyone in the own ways . 
5341	The reasons for keeping the electoral college are that it really wouldnt be fair to citizens , and the thrill for upcoming presidents wouldnt be able to share there wonderful thoughts to change billions of lifes 
5342	Since the electoral college process only consists of 538 electors that are selected, meeting of the electors who vote for the president and vuce president, and the counting of the electoral votes by the congress. 
5343	It's a organized sysytem that doesn't base off of popularity which is fair because if you vote by popularity and have a president in office that everyone voted for but is running the country into the ground because of terrible reasoning and democracy the people and the states are to blame for voting for a president who wasn't guarnteed to keep his or her word about solving the country's problems. 
5344	The electoral system needs fixes in place such as what would be good for the state and changing its laws and the system being able to work with the boundaries that certain states have with their own different voting process and its laws how the voting process works. 
5345	Most people may not like who are next president is gonna be but all just have to deal with it because we all cant go back and pick who we wont to be president. 
5346	It all depends on how many votes a person gets. Some may get only one vote and others will get millions of vote it all depends on if they think your good enough to rule your your county. It is very hard for you to make a decsion that big. 
5347	Why this people no think about the people who need help? 
5348	why they need all time new cars but what about the people who don't have house or food? it is a better ide than just a new cars, for what? more cars if we have a lot.  Now we have all forms for go contry by country but why the don't think in someting more special, more important like help other countrys. Not with just one little part I mean if we don't need something new why we use why we don't buy some clothes or seme shoes for wo need it?  It is more easy and better for allthe people in the world. 
5349	And what about the animals? 
5350	"why we have to eat all time animals? why everything is create by the animals now? The people know they hav fellings like us? Now the ""human"" is a animal, we kill everything what we see ""everything.  "
5351	"We don't have a lot time in this world, God is coming for us and we need something for make this world better, wecan try to help persons, animals, trees, ans a lot more, we don't need more cars just because the people who wave money think is better foe they.  every body know if they will do those cars jus are for people with a lot mone and not for who really need cars. I know I don't talk about your ""cars"" like what you want but i don't think like you. I think if we have something and we can give that for someone who really need it we Have to do, it is better than use that for nothing immportant or special like people like you want. "
5352	second that Everyone's President 
5353	third the Swing States 
5354	fourth the Big States 
5355	The electoral college stores the weight in the big states in the political balance. 
5356	voters in presidential rather than people who want express a political preference rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election. 
5357	First of all not only are candidates wanting to vote for the person thay want to they dont have a chance popular vote wont win. 
5358	but on the outher hand elctoral vote seem to work out for some candidates. 
5359	Voters in presidentialelections are people who want to express a political preference rather than people who think that single vote may decide an election. 
5360	I think that many students work hard to get at least a B average, and maybe if the really love a sport and want to play in it then we should be fare and let them play. 
5361	Therefore if they really loved sports and wanted to play in them, then they would try to raise their grade for it. 
5362	"The Electoral College is unfair, outdated, and irration. Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president. The electoral college is unfair to voters, because of the winner-take-all system in each state. Candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the ""swing"" states. Over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now. And yet, the electoral college still has its defenders. "
5363	The Electoril;a Collge is very confusing because the time being wasted to elect a president is rather lost waiting in line to just check down a name on a piece of paper.  
5364	I am the few students who are in the middle 
5365	and some skeptics say markings were hidden by a haze or it could have been because of the weather 
5366	Some skeptics also say that the alien markigs were hidden by haze. On April of 1998 when the skeptics say their ideas it was cloudy at that time and on Mars it was winter. 
5367	Some people think that the face on Mars is really created by aliens. There is some scientifical evidence to this. 
5368	There was a natural landform that looked like a human head, shadows gave the rock some eyes, a noes, and mouth. 
5369	That is true, they arent fair because they make it so that their votes are more important than everyone elses. Most people dont even vote for president, they vote for electors in the Electoral College so they can vote for president. I bet that everytime the Electoral College voted for a president people from different states yelled and screamed at them. 
5370	everyones president, swing states, big states, 
5371	in my opinion i think we should change the election by popular votes instead of ellectoral college, because we the people .. vote for who we think should be head or our state and who we think is going to be in charge and do they thiing and make our a state a better and safier place to live. 
5372	We dont vote for electorsÂ  ... so many people can vote on one paticular person to be head of our state and president and the other person can only get 3 votesÂ  but in ellectoral collage he/she can have more electoral votes and they win the election .. even tho the other canidate has more popular votes. 
5373	because, school is just a place to learn, everybody who goes to school learns at least something in school 
5374	the only one election that it didnt help on was in 2000 al gore recived more indivisial votes than george bush nationwide, but bush won the election, reciveing 271 electoral votes to gore 266. 
5375	This is the one of the most important concepts to understand in the process of the Electoral College, for we must know that each vote you compose, you vote for a slate of electors, who will basically vote for their candidate. 
5376	"""The Electoral College is a process, not a place"" ( "
5377	And marketing would sky rocket. 
5378	At the end of the day technology will have a lot of malfunctioning problems and a Driverless Car will be one of them. So be smart and purchase one at your own risk. 
5379	The development of a human contolled car is not the reason for the cars not being far more advanced, but the safety of the drivers and passengers. 
5380	The materials and costs would sky rocket, gas companies and bio-fuel makers would be very unhappy becasue they would lose there jobs. The roads would also be very risky to work with. traffic jams and heavy pedestrian activity would have to be very important; The sensors would have to be top of the line and have a very sensitive trigger for response. 
5381	In recent years the cars have been more and more technologically advanced. Radar and mapping have become much more adapt and are being updated much more frequently. 
5382	There are many conserns people may have, but the cars have come a very long way and are becoming even more capable each day. 
5383	Its about the hard work in life that gets your through the bad and good. And that you need to show respect for the environment and others around you. 
5384	So over all yes Kids should be allowed to have their cell phones at crowd. 
5385	If you are willing to vote, choose carefully and be percise with your answer. Don't let others get in your way, it's your choice and time, so express a political preference rather than deciding an election. 
5386	First of all, voting is all about the candidates, try to understand and know the candidates before voting 
5387	Secondly, If you don't want to waste your time and thinking that your vote would not make a difference, then I'm sure others feel the same way. 
5388	"""A large state gets more attention from presidential candidates in a campaign than a small state does."" Every state should get the equal amount of attention then any other state, and it should all be about the electors by sharing their own opinions. "
5389	Thirdly, Candidates should think about their electors and keeping this world safe and sercure for us rather than just wanting to be in the white house. 
5390	"""Candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the swing states."" It's great that the candidates are appreciative by the electors and wanting our vote to count. "
5391	"Large states as Texas, California, and Minnesota would have a ""winner-take-all"" system that awards all electors to the winning presidential canidate. People not in those states would get angry and things would get bad. It takes 270 out of 538 to be elected president and if changing to popular vote for the election would be thelargest state elector would be the president.  "
5392	In Texas if you wanted to vote for John Kerry you'd vote for a slate of 34 Democratic electors pledged to Kerry, and thats just one thing that is wrong. 
5393	The Electoral College is a process, not a place. The founding father established it in the Constitution as a compromise between elections ot the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens. The Electoral College process consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting for the electors wherer they vote for the President and the Vice President, and counting of the electoral votes by Congress. 
5394	. Which is a dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is possible but it's less likely than a dispute over the popular vote. 
5395	But many still believe that it is alien. Even though this some of the best evidence to peove the face on mars isnt alien but a mistake. 
5396	because it helps kids in college figure out how the election goes and for them to vote. 
5397	Imagine, voting in the upcoming election in vain knowing that organizations that only select the votes of one entire state, unconsious of the other millions individuals in the other surplus of the nation exist. The possibility of the one in fifty states choosing majorly one particular candidate, is highly risky for the goverment, and no one should permit putting in risk the goverment with this stubborn prefrence of electoral votes. Incontestably, the Electoral College System, is not a method of voting that should be unresposibly utilized to advantage the four years of presidency 
5398	It's dreadful that the anticipation a legal individual once awaited on, can no longer be celebrated or reinacted, with this fashion of electing states, that manage the majority votes of the respective candidate. Can voters control whom their electors vote for? That results in a false and negative answer. Thence, it is more than clear that the old-fashion and benevolent method of regrouping all the cadenced voices of all the recievable votes is appropate and suitable for the public and president. 
5399	The electoral college does alsonot work because it was created by our founding fathers. 
5400	Hello my name is STUDENT_NAME, and i would like to tell you about how i feel on your new policy for sports and curriculum . 
5401	whether it's new or not. many things shouldn't change just because it feels right or it may help with your problems because 9 times out of 10 it may go all wrong when you try it but all worked out in your head perfectly. 
5402	i think there's absoulutely nothing wrong with the electoral college i think it gives good advice and helps motivates you 
5403	the winner take all method of awarding electoral votes induces the candidatesÂ  to focus their campaign efforts on the toss-up states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign. 
5404	I sometimes think many people are aganist electoral college because the way it seperates the votes and only half will be required to go to the election and be seen 
5405	And others may have their opinions on this but it's ok to have your own opinion also different opinions don't hurt nobody it's just that different people believe in different things.    
5406	The Electoral College lacks of democratic pedigree. Why is that? Because of cerainty of outcome, everyone's president, swing states, big states, and avoid run off elections. They all are practical reasons, not liberal or conservative reasons. 
5407	Yes, I understand it's' a planet we haven't been on yet 
5408	don't you get that, they could have perfectly normal things just like the Earth that happen every day. Do you understand now? 
5409	It is very hard to get to the face in space because our teams have to go different places, we have to look at different things. 
5410	you never know though, but we don't make it over the face very often, it's hard to get a better view from it. 
5411	It was a good way to engage the public attraction to Mars. It became an icon in mocies, books, talk shows, it was every where for 25 years. Many scientists believed it was important to NASA and very few believed it was an alien artifact, after eighteen long years the Vikining mission was over. 
5412	wrecks would be less common if the mechanics work on the cars they provide. Companies think to much of money so that would be the only problem. I mean sure they wold not make as much money as they would like to but people would be a lot more safe then they are. The money they make should go to the coverage of peoples cars.  
5413	If you have a certain speed limit and or if yor car stops working what are y going to do. I think that if you get this car everything should have to be covered by the compaies you buy it from. Some states are already trying to ok all of this through way higher powers than they should. They should have a system on the car that explains why your late. 
5414	I mean if they don't know how the car works than what is the point of it. I think that anyone who gets one of these cars should have to take driving courses one a year for a week. They can take them any day they choose as long as it adds up to a week out of the year. The car is not the only problem think about the roads next. 
5415	I think that community service is a great way to keep our planet clean. 
5416	So to start here is a letter to my state senator, in which I argue in favor of keeping the electoral college or changing to election by popular vote for the president of the united states 
5417	"The electoral college is a process, not a place. The electoral college process consists of the selection of the electors. The electoral college consists of 538 electors. In the 23 Amendment of the constitution, the district of columbia is allocated 3 electors and treatedÂ  like a state for purposes of the electoral college. For this reason, in the following discussion, the word ""state"" also refers to the district of columbia. Next, each canidate running for president in your state has his or her own group of electors.  The electors are generally chosen by the candidate's political party,but state laws vary on how the electors are selected and what their responsibilities are.  The president election is held every four years on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. Also, most states have a ""winner-take-all"" system that awards all electors to the winning presidential canidate . However, Maine and Nebraska each have a variation of ""proportion representation"".  Abolishing the electoral college! But don't worry they're not alone; according to a Gallup poll in 2000, taken shortly after Al Gore.  Thanks to the quirks of the electoral college, which won the popular vote but lost the presidency, over 60 percent of voterswould prefer a direct election to the kind we have now.  Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president.  You might not know this so if you dont here is something very interesting for you to know. Who are the electors? Well they can be snoyone not holding public office. Here's something eles you might know, Who picks the electors in the first place? well here's the answer it depends on the state. The single best argument against the electoral college is what we might call the disaster factor.  The American people should consider themselces lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century; the system allows for must more. consider that state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors, and thats those electors could always defy the will of the people. Black in 1960.  Perhaps most worrying is the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote. In that case, the election would be thrown to the hose of representatives, where state deegations vote on the president. "
5418	Okay to end my letter, my con conclustion is that this is my letter to my state seator 
5419	It may be old, 
5420	new things aren't always the best things. 
5421	I think if the Goverment wanted to change it they should try it on a state first before they roll it to the rest of the nation, and we all know the goverment isn't that smart and won't do it because we are their test animals. 
5422	The Electoral College System allows certainity of outcome. No run-off election because mostly likely there will be no tie. No arguing about the president being from a certain place or region so that state favors the president. Winner-takes-all system allows the people to pay close attention to the election. Swing states allow a little excitement during the election because some states like Florida you don't know which way they are going to go.Â  Big states also like Florida gets the president on the edge because the can loose every small state and still win with the big ones. 
5423	270 votes are not a lot of votes to win an elction with, but every vote counts. Some people may not vote because there are only two parties that most of the nation only cares about the Republicans and the Democrats. 
5424	Some people dont like tovote in fear of their party not winning due to its unpopularity. 
5425	But everyone should vote to express there politcal power. 
5426	That's why we should keep it because if we change it we're changing our minds in the way vote.    
5427	It just makes it more easier for people to not do anything. 
5428	Televison and movies have been fasinated by cars that could drive their selves. 
5429	Under specific occasions google has had cars driving since 2009. Their cars have been driven more half a million miles without a crash. They arnt truely driverless yet they alert the driver when they need to take over the wheel when traffic is really badd or going through road work. Futurists believed the key to developing self-driving cars someday isnt just the smart cars its smarter roads. How much smarter did the cars ned to be? in the 1980s automakers used speed sensors at the wheels in the creation of antilock brakes. within a decade those sensors had become more advanced to detect and respond to the danger of out of control skids or rollovers. The information from the sensors could make the car apply brakes. In 2013 BMW anounced the development of traffic Jam Assitant the car can handle driving functions at speeds up to 25 mph,But speacial touch sensors make sure the driver keeps hold of the wheel. They can steer in traffic and other road construction. This necisates the car being ready to quickly get the drivers attention whenever a problem has occured. 
5430	Displays can be turned off instantly when the driver needs to take over something not to the drivers trying to text with a cell phone. In this way the In car system is actually a safety feature, and saftey is a big concern. Most driving laws focus on getting the passengers,drivers,and pedestrians safe and let know the law makers that in these cars are safety. Tesla has projected a 2016 release for a car capable of driving on autopilot 90 percent of the time. Mercedes benz,audi,and nissan plan to have cars that can drive themselves by 2020. The road to the truly autonomous car streches on ahead of us, but we grow closer to the destination. 
5431	Now yes i understand that maybe some dictators through out history may have needed to take a step back and really see how their environment was hurting and try to change it. But why did most tyrants in history become tyrannic? As children they felt like everyone was against them, they felt closed off from everyone else, and maybe that wouldn't have happened if the home that they grew up in, and the town that they were raised in was cleaner and safer.  For example look at Josef Stalin, who killed more people than Adolf Hitler. Josef had a tough childhood, he had to fight just to stay alive. He earned everything he gained. But after he became the man who had everything he started turning into the man who lost everything. Now I am not a fan of the practice of communism, but the idea of it is great. No one should be turned down due to economic problems. Everyone deserves a good opportunity.  Some people just cant help if they start out with a disadvantage. But sooner or later everyone has a chance to make something of themselves.  Whether their chance be a job, an education, a family, or a military service to their country. Everyone has a chance to mean something to someone. I mean isn't that what we all want, to matter? Some people have stronger drives for glory than others. Look at Achilles for instance, he wanted his name to live through the ages, and he knew that the Trojan War would help him with that. But with glory always comes retribution. Fame and demise have gone hand in hand through out history. 
5432	So basically what I'm trying to say is that community service is only used so that people with disadvantages should be able to acquire those advantages, but no matter where someone comes from, what race or creed they belong to, everyone is a product of their environment.  
5433	We should change it to polular vote because the elecoral college is really unfair to Americas citizens. 
5434	Like I said it is unfair, outdated, and irrational,with all these things I dont think many people would like that .So I think we should change it to popular vote, 
5435	According to paragraph three of source one , the Electoral College consist of five hundred and thirty-eight electors . A canidate has to earn two hundred and seventy of those votes . 
5436	To me that is not right . Why spend time bringing these people in to vote when you have a whole state full of people who wants to have a voice in the matter. 
5437	How come everyone doesnt vote for who thy want by themselves ? Maybe someone whats a president frome another state instead of their own .According to paragraph fourteen , It states that the electoral college is unfair , outdated and irrational and i agree one hundred percent . As Bob Dole Says Abolish the Electoral College . 
5438	In closing i hope you will view in my favor and in everyone elses who says this type of system is old , unfair and it needs to be ruled out . 
5439	first than all ,all kids like to have a phone but some of this kids use in the school to chat with other kids and they don't listen to the class you cant not use the phone in class if they used the teacher can giving him a detention . i think that are kids not use his phone in class. 
5440	Well first off, i dont really care if they are made or not, it's not my money or time being invested or devoted into them. Now i wouldnt say they are a good idea, but i will say i think they are a really cool project and concept, and i do and know they are out there. 
5441	Do i see issues with cars that can guide or drive themselves? Yes, i do 
5442	And I think there would be a giant hole around the face because were they needed the rock or whatever it is on mars to make the face. And its like a cloud kinda just because it looks like a bunny or dog dont mean someone made it look like one somethings just happen that way 
5443	The Electoral college process consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for President and Vice President, and the counting of electorals votes by Congress. The Electoral College consists of 538 electors. A majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the President. Under the 23rd Amendmentof the Constitution, the District of Columbia is allocated 3 electors and treated like a state for purposesof the Electoral College.  Each candidate running for President in your state has his or her own group of Electors.I know the electors are generally chosen by the candidate's politicail party, but state law vary on how the electors are selected and what their responsibilities are .. Also the Presidential election is geld every four years on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. 
5444	Like Forest Gump once said, 'life is like a box of chocolate you will never know what your going to get.' 
5445	it happened in 2000- but its less likely than a dispute over the popular vote. in pharagrapgh 18, it states that the reason is that the winning candidates share of the Electoral Collge is invariably exceeds his share of the popular vote.  
5446	Mostly because this is a free country and we are the people of this country who have been given rights to vote for our own president . Not to vote for our own president then have the congress vote tooÂ . To me its kind of seems like you just have to question the process a little bit . At the end of all of this that president is representing the people and trying his/her best to make us happy and keep us happy. 
5447	be cause people can vote on electors andÂ  not the actual presedent they want to win for the vote because people think he or she may or may not be the best person to be for that job we should keep the electoral college for reasons like not haveing to pick or choose for theÂ  better person. To be if the both want kinda the same thing,it would help the people not the presedent it only gets them votes and votes are nouthing to me or others. 
5448	2. second i think we should keep it beacuse you can tell who voted and not the people that voted 
5449	because you get a sticker that said i voted so that puts an place that you have voted or not and if u dont u have some time to do it or there will be anourther person who takes and votes in ur place and u wont be able to vote 
5450	3. because the ballet things are full and the time is up for them to vote ,so they have to wait till the next time to vote is 
5451	ansd that will be the next year so useing the electoral collageÂ  will allow u to be able to vote on time and mnot miss be ing able to vote becaus evoting is im portant to the county or the contonet to be counted on not only you but others around so u can have a choice of what you want to have as a presedent of the united states 
5452	4. third haveingf the electoral college will help tho ones who cant get out to vote 
5453	and be able to do it just about any wear your at and that will be help full to me and othere because im nort allowed to vote yet so it comes in handy in many ways to us and other people to ther united states 
5454	To get evidence from Mars to see if it is really a face would cost NASA a huge budget. 
5455	Just to go to Mars is a lot, but to go there and get evidence from there and bring it to Earth is a lot. It also can effect the way back to Earth and be dangerous. They don't stop at Cydonia so they would have to plan it out and get all the supplies they would need to get there and get the evidence they need. 
5456	Then their parents could be proud of them for how good they did on that sport. 
5457	I will like to argue about the Electoral College. 
5458	The voters vote for the presidant,but they are just voting for a slate of electors that they can elect the presidant 
5459	What if we have an electoral tie like in 1968.There was 41,971 votes that could of gotten deadlocked the election 
5460	It's against direct elections that are spurious 
5461	Everybody is arguing about the Electoral College.Everybody thinks its unfair,outdated,and irrational 
5462	Let's change the Electoral College by making it better for us and Congress. 
5463	Why should people who be qualified be only able to vote? Voting should be for everyone, not such as anyone like as in Gang related people or people who are in prison but you get the point. This '' Electoral College '' experiment that they already have been going on is just something that they can use to get more time to think out what their next move is. They way certaint people, like me, see things like if the One out of the other person who is running for President and his votes come back with such little insufficient votes like 87% to 89.5% the should continue the vote and the show must continue! Even though the ''Electoral College'' seems like just a waste of time, does it even work? 
5464	But if they never know the feeling of accomplishment when it comes to that. 
5465	say you're at a restraunt and they ask what you want on your hamburger your not just going to tell them to put what ever they want on it because then you wont like it, same situation just not with food. why would you want to live in a world with a leader you dont like, making choices you dont like eighter, everyone obviously wounldnt get their first choice because there has to be a winner and a loser. even if you lose thats better to say that you got a chance to say what you wanted it just didnt follow through. 
5466	We also all have the right of speech in the United States. 
5467	"What i mean by this is, we were all given a mouth by God for a reason. ""A closed mouth wont get fed"" so how would a closed mouth country get the correct leader they wanted? exactly they couldnt thats my point. if we speek were going to get a chance of getting more thought of when the decision is made, so if we were to all speek up the decision would be in our favor. "
5468	We all have a choice for diffrent things, 
5469	some people like peanut butter, some people dont like peanut butter, some people are alergic to peanut butter. so say you hate peanut butter and you told the waitress your order and she said no youre getting a peanut butter sandwhich, you, hatin peanut butter, obviosuly wouldnt like that at all. Same sitauation here. Why would they let you say your choice in what you want then just tell you what youre going to get? its just not right and dsent add up.  
5470	''The electoral college is a process, not a place. The founding fathers established it in the Constitution as a compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens.' 
5471	"In the article ""Driverless Cars Are Coming,"" the author presents both the positive and the negative aspects of driverless cars. Therefore, the author never takes a side on the matter. "
5472	"Many people might still think that mars landform was a sign form aliens and saying that they exist personally I don't think there is aliens in mars or any other planet in our solar system. That was just my idea about it I don't think my statement could be true. Maybe smart kid like a nerd would say "" scientists who are studying this kind of martian studies could get results of a real life alien that could be roaming around earth"". That's what I would think a nerd would say or maybe he might just say it even smarter than I said it, but that is my opinion I would like to hear about more peoples opinions on the face on mars. Even though many other people will just argue over that it was a face but maybe the aliens destroyed it or just abducted it like they do in boring fake movies of aliens but that's my opinion not you if you don't agree with me it's fine with me.   "
5473	The Face on Mars is a natural landform because it was spotted with shadowy likeness of a human, it resembles the human head, and it actually shows a Martian equivalent of a butte or messa.  
5474	Either way, this decision will affect how your students will have to manage their schedules after school hours. 
5475	That would end up in disaster 
5476	"The electoral collage is a founding fathers established in the constitution as a compromise between election of the president by a vote. There are consis of 588 electory and majority of 270 electory votes is required elect the president. So there for electors generally choose by candidates political partys. Presidential election is held every four years but it on a Tuesday after the first monday.  whoeverÂ  you have choosen the states elector you would beÂ  really be voting for your next president .  How that works is when you vote for your candidate you are actually voting for your candidate elector.  And who ever has the most votes the winner ""takes it all"" type of sytem to the winning presidential candidates.  After the elcetion has ended your governor takes it time for the ""centificate of Ascertaniment"" for all the candidact ran for the preisdent . Also for the Centificate of Ascertaniment makes it in your state and shows which electors will represent your state. "
5477	So those are the some things that the elector candidates say about the whole proccesÂ  Â     
5478	a more options for estudent that cant go to school on morning they can go on the asfer nuon or they can home classes or vidio confedensil. 
5479	disten lornin is a good idia because no all the time wi can go aut sayd or have the mauch time but tha is a good idia 
5480	i wist we can help all the world for the little children can go to school they will me so happy ther dreem cambe real what day wish to du or gohave dome for demen that is all forme thank you.Â Â  
5481	this is the rule of it process consists of the selection of the selection of the electors the meetion of the elecctors where they vote for president and vice president and the counting of the electoral votes by congress. I personally thinck that that is not that smart of a rule,because the president would propally say that he would do all of this stuff saying that we do not have to pay taxes and stuff trying to convince us to vote for him by lying to us.  
5482	As well as other presidents could be telling the truth and saying all of this stuff saying that one day they will make people stop paying taxes and poeople right away will thinck ohhh yess no taxes lets vote for this guy wile really they can do that but they will rise the prices on everything and then people will get mad agian. 
5483	I thinck that the president should not talk to everyone one by one because then that would be just way to long and tireing. 
5484	As well as the person could just decide to bribe everyone. thoes are all just one reason that i thinck we should change the rule. There are also some good parts about it everyone will be able to hear the president talk instead of having to hear him through tv and people making adiou changes or people hearing their tv wrong or people haveing their tv volume to low 
5485	"''And that is all i have to say about that"".    "
5486	electoral college should be kept because it will help save the tress by saving paper, 
5487	one wouldnt have to go anywhere because the electoral college is not a place 
5488	saving paper is extremely important. 
5489	paper comes from trees and many animals and wild life have homes in trees. with electoral college one wouldnt need paper to vote, which is a paper saver. the electoral college helps a lot when it comes to selecting electors,metting of the electors and where they wil vote for the president, and vice president, and the counting of the electoral votes by congress. by saving gas one is saving money which can be used for any nessessitites. 
5490	gas now a days is extremely expensive,but with the electoral college one would be saving money because the electoral college is a process, not a place, 
5491	it doesnt require one to travel anywhere,whch saves gas and money. with the oney saved one can buy the nessessities that are needed. the electoral college offers a lot by just being a process. it helps save paper and money,whch is good for wild life and humans.  
5492	MostÂ  counterclaims to my explanation is swing states 
5493	"In conclusion, I think the electoral college should be abolished. By doing this, we could avoid electoral ties, and the ""disaster factor''. We can also be more fair and rational to voters. These are the reasons I would like abolish the Electoral college.    "
5494	the diverless cars will help tons of people around the world. 
5495	Many students call and text their family and friends, not a lot are doing business calls and making plans for certain events 
5496	Public school students also have grades that they want to keep up to par, home schoolÂ students don't 
5497	Introducing driverless cars to today's society would be a very big step in technology. 
5498	"According to paragraph 1 it says "" The Electoral College is a Process not a place the founding fathers established it in the constitution as a compromise between election of the president by a vote in congress and election of the president by a popular vote of qualified citizens."" So when you hear that it's not a place and its a process yay! we're learning "
5499	"that's not the question so wait heres the part when you feel like the biggest chunk again... the question is Does The Electoral College Work? Aha see you thought you won the 4v4 but really it's just getting started. Like how can you win if you don't know anything about the process college well thank godness im here because im gonna educate you goats. According to paragraph 2 ""The Electoral college process consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for president and vice president,and the counting of the electoral votes by congress"". So what i think it's saying is that this is how like our wonderful presidents get elected. this is the voting system that elects vice pres,pres,meeting the to runners and electors thats the electoral college in a nut shell. "
5500	So let me tell you why our founding fathers started this in 1769's or something like that but ever since they made this system it's been going on until 2015! 
5501	so the answer to that question would be yes it does work because it gives the people a right to choose who they want and the president doesn't get to much power and without this system we wouldn't have any presidents you know what i mean.  
5502	"WE  dont even really vote for our Electors. ""Well who does ? "" you ask. The state conventions ,sometimes the state party , sometimes even the presidential candidates themselves. We should be lucky that the 2000 election was the biggest crisis in a century ; but this process could end up getting much worse like in 1960. The segregtions almost led to no more Democratic electors. We still proceed with all evidence as to why we shouldnt have Electoral Colleges. "
5503	Then we have the big states that use some of their large states. 
5504	like in Florida the 2012 election the state had a very close popular vote and got 29 electoral voates. Then it came down to Wyoming with 3 electoral votes and it took all. 
5505	Let us having our phones out during times like lunch will probable even help us with school it will make us eager to come to school because we'll be having more fun. Come on you cant really sit there and give me reasons why that's a rule it's supposed to be a free country. 
5506	I like the whole idea on that the car would have to have someone that is checking out for the car but it would be hard for the person to keep the concentration on the road. 
5507	Also what is the whole point on driverless cars I think they would be able to get around in traffic, accidents , and construction sites? 
5508	I think it would also be alot nicer if they could get around that stuff on there own too.  
5509	The Electoral College has many amazing things people like about using it .When it comes to voting not many people do 
5510	Thats why in the Electoral College process consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for President and Vice President, and the counting of the electoral votes by Congress. There are about 538 electors, now that's alot of people if you ask me. Only 270 of the electoral votes is required to elect the President which is an okay amount of votes for the President election.  
5511	On the other hand, under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who inturn elect the president. The single best argument against the electoral college is what we might call the disaster factor. The American people should consider themeselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century, but the system allows much worse. People are more worried about having a tie in the electoral vote. The election would be thrown in the House of Representatives, where state delegation vote on the President, also the senate would choose the Vice President. 
5512	Not everyone thinks the same tho about electoral College because some people dont like it because some states have more representatives,but yet again what if it was your state that have the most representatives like Califorina with 55 of them wouldnt you want a huge avantage like that? I know I would.  
5513	I dont think there will ever be a 100% driverless car i think there will alway be a person with some what controll or should be at all time even in a car that has all the most advanced driverless tecnlogty. i think the need for a humman is needed at all times becaus that tecnlogy wiil fail and if ther is one driverless car on a highway and the human is not in controll and if it was to mess up it could kill a lot of inacent people. but my personal opion is if there are a few driverless cars cool use them at spechel event like the daytona 500,award ceremoneys, in honering someone and things like that..... i think i would be a bad idea to make them avalible to the public for many reasons some being when they mess up how many people will get hurt and when theyn sell them only rich people will be able to afford them because the tecnlogy will be so advanced and cost so munch and the incerence will cost a fortune and when they fail and if they are able to fix them who and how munch will it cost to fix. if people are to lazy to drive them selves then we have a problem 
5514	im not sure how may people would buy themi would not like not being in controll of what my car is doing . 
5515	My first reason is that only a few of my friends from NASA believe that this strange landform was really made by aliens. 
5516	If the advocates of this position is correct in arguing that the Electoral College method is not democratic in a modern sense . It is the electers who elect the president, not the people . It is entirely possible that the winner of the electoral vote will not win the national popular vote. yet this has happened very rarely when Gore had more popular votes then Bush . It can be argued that the Electoral college method of selecting the president may turn off selecting the president may turn off potential voters for a canadidate who has no hope of carrying their state . And not having everyone vote mite throw things off too. but of courseno votersÂ  vote swings a national election, and in spite of that about one -half the eligible American population did vote in 2012 's election. 
5517	It think we all think thatevery one should yote and know basic back ground on who there voting for, and avoidÂ  run off elections. 
5518	Some adults get really worked up over cell phones. They aren't a bad thing. They are amazingly useful and they are only bad when they are used in class. Cell phones are great for communicating. You can talk to someone anywhere at anytime for free. If you need help or are in a car accident, you can just use your cell phone and they will help you. 
5519	Yes, also true the electoral vote keeps other parties who are not sufficient enough to run the country 
5520	I think that we should keep the Electoral College but we could also change election by popular vote 
5521	because there could be problems over the outcome of an Electoral College, the reason is that the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College invariably exceeds his share of the popular vote. The Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal. A candidate with only regional appeal is unlikely to be a successful president. Voters in toss-up are more likely to pay close intention to the campaign, knowing that they are going to decide the election. The Electoral College avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the vote cast. It also restores some weight in the political balance. There is pressure for run-off elections when no candidate wins a majority of the votes cast. The Electoral College method of selecting the president may turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state. 
5522	The argument against the electoral college is what we might call disaster factor. If there is a tie in the electoral vote, the election would be thrown to the House of Representatives, where state delegations vote on the president. Because each state casts only one vote. the electoral college is unfair to voters, because of the winner-take-all system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, they only focus on the right races in the swing states. But each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote the party's nominee, but it is entirely possible that the winner of the electoral vote will not win the national popular vote. The Elecotral college is widely regarded as an person or a thing that seems to belong to the past and not to fit in the present, it's a non- demogratic method of selecting a president that ought to be overruled by declaring the candidate who receive most popular votes the winner. 
5523	So i think we should keep electoral college because it's a process not a place. 
5524	"""The founding faters established it in the constitution as compromise between election of the president by a vote in Congress and election of the president by a popular vote of qualified citizens"" "
5525	The electoral college is widely regarded as an anachronism, a non democratic method of choosing a president that ought to be overruled by declaring the candidate who recieves the most popular votes the winner 
5526	Everyone has different way of learning .some people are visual learners,some are kinesthetic learner,which one are you? 
5527	And that it was not created by aliens because aliens can not create or make rocks.  
5528	I think cars should still be famous in the future so we could make new cars. 
5529	electoral votes are basically a summary of the states vote . People vote for a slate of electors to represent their state in the election . Voters will vote for a representative to choose who becomes president on electoral votes 
5530	The face on mars have to be a alien 
5531	back in time they did not have spaceships 
5532	If they did have spaceships back in the past we would of already discover it by now. It's probably a alien because it was buried in the ground for so may years that face is actually popping out. They should unburied it to see if it's human or not. If it is they have alot of research to do if not they still have alot have research to do. They should try to see if a body goes with that head. It could be a decovery of a new world 
5533	They can also look up any information about mars having a volcanoe. That no one knows about. but if we just know found this it is more likey to be a alien. Because we been going to mars for a long time and it's weird that they just know recover that face. 
5534	What if this person really wanted to try out but could not play because there grade is a C plus and need a B average to play on the sport team that they wanted to play on. And what if another kid had straight A' s but could not play on a team because they had one C then they couldn't play on that team. 
5535	Again i think that it is a terrible rule for a child to play on a team or activity and must maintain a B average. 
5536	Then, they will take up all their time using them in the free periods. 
5537	aliens are made up creatures they are just tools to make science non fictional movies come to life 
5538	"I just strongly think that aliens are made up they can't be real there is no proof to back up what everyone believes . Space doesn't have any gravity so their can't be any animals up there floating ! The mask kinda looks like clay maybe the mask is made out of clay that you can mold it into anything you want ! I know that sounds crazy but someone thinking that a alien created makes it sound even more crazier ! Lets be VERY serious The article says ""Face on Mars has been popular in magazines and talk shows"" People will believe anything these days even i know that half of the things that the media says or does is not true and i also know that they make things up for attention or too be well known "
5539	I don't have any evidence or proof that Aliens are real 
5540	There is NO proof so i can't process it i know somebody named De'Oshmonya that knows a lot about mars and space so i may have to ask her what she thinks about it im sure she will tell me everything i need to know ! It may cause a little argument tho , but thats okay we're still going to be close . This passage helped me because it taught me some things i didn't know and it prepares me for the future it does make me wonder Are aliens real ? When i go to sleep tonight i may do some research and i'll try to find some proof . I should've done research so i could have a lot of evidence to back my statement up that would've been the best thing to do . 
5541	Even tho i said i don't believe in aliens it does make me question alot of things . This article was written way before i was born things have changed and everything should be different now. Maybe if aliens were real they were probably alive in the ancient times and probably left when the dino's left 
5542	Probably not, and all of this is so improbable that I really don't even need to write an argumentative essay about it anyway. There is an extremely small and slim chance that aliens had any part in making a mesa on Mars. 
5543	A dispute over the popular vote compared to only 51.3 precentas steated in source 3 number 2 
5544	it cause many crisis to happened. 
5545	First and foremost the Electoral College is very old. 
5546	ON my cocnlusion i will adrress the creason that igiven on seoncd paragraph and i will adreress the description of difference i have given on paragraph four. And i will conclude the paragraph three as the last. One i given the reason of how stdent who are taking classes at school thayÂ do have manyÂ benefit. Two i have given the description on paragraph four of how student who are taking classes at home, and student who are taking classes at school is not same classes at home have few benefit. Because the situation it may not be serious and this paragraph it is kind reason that i have given, but not necessary. Last and not least i was focus on paragraph three where i did not have things to saybecause is not strong argumentÂ , and ihave given one reason on it and few examples.   Â  Â  Â  Â Â  
5547	The thing that I don't like about bringing cell phones to school is that if you get caught with them they have to charge 5 dollars the first time 10 on the second time plus keeping them like for a month, 15 for the third time, and keeping them for the rest of the school year. 
5548	If you don't let us bring cell phones well don't let the teachers using them in class, because if we can't bring them well that's not fair to us. Will you please let us bring cell phones if somebody gets caught three times with a cell phone please don't let them bring them again, don't charge them 
5549	I think the reason that you don't let us bring cell phones is because some students don't pay attention in class, and they spend the entire class period texting. 
5550	"but in the second article it says ""Because of the winner-take-all system in EACH state"".  "
5551	But Sometimes it could be a distraction from you doing all your work. 
5552	When you get home schooled you dont have to worry about teachers telling you what to do, but until you get that video call on your laptop. 
5553	"You can pull out your phone and talk without somebody saying "" Put your phone up and stop talking"". But sometimes your teacher that assigns your work will have a group conference call with you and a few otherÂ people in the online classes you got. "
5554	some of this states didn't even see a campaing ad how sad is that because this country is know for the equalness off every one but yet the electoral college forgets about seventeen states that are small because theirÂ vote doesn't matter.?  
5555	I do not think it is fair that students have to maintain a B or higher average to participate in gym or in other activities. 
5556	I am against this because I belive it would create many arguments and I belive we are not ready for this yet. 
5557	Therefore, I think It's highly doubtful that this could happen.  
5558	This is coming from a middle school student who takes algebra 1 in 8th grade and is recommended for English honors for high school next fall. That isn't pleased with a single b in any class that gets straight a' s. 
5559	i know that i am very highly over them in academics and especially all sports. I bet i will go to a d1 university hopefully at NOTRE DAME for a starting wide receiver or cornerback position. In order to go to that prestigious d1 university you have to have a 4.2 gpa and a hell of a top football player in the country. 
5560	they should just spend some time reviewing simple mistakes they have made in the past. 
5561	If we do that we don't have time to do other stuff. I think community service is to much for us. I other people should do it. 
5562	I also thinks its time for a change and I believe that this will bring up students grades. 
5563	Kids are saying it takes to much time way 
5564	the electoral college most be important that makes the people to chose what do they want 
5565	it consists to make the people take their own desiton about who do they want to help them and make their lives better in al the ways, the electors have to be near the people of the town or city cause in that way the people feels more closer to them and they can trust the work of the electors. 
5566	 1 the author is trying to explain how does this works,to help the people of the town and especially that if you vote that means that you are helping to the elctors and that probaly wil not help if you dont choose the correct person.       
5567	I thank you for taking the time to listen to my thoughts, 
5568	Like Sometimes When You Get Out Of School And You Have To Tell Your Mom To Pick You Up Or To Tell Her Something Important You Need To Use A Phone But There Is No One To Let You Use It And That Is Why sometimes You Need To Bring A Phone to School. 
5569	So Principal I Believe You Should Allow Us To Bring Phones To School And Use Them During Lunch Periods And Other Free Times, And During Class The Phones Are Going To Be turned Off. 
5570	And If Somebody Uses It During Class, You Can Take Away Their Right To Bring Their Phones To School But Only To The Person That Used It During Class. I Think That's A Fair Idea. 
5571	You may be thinking what do i mean by i dont want that in our country what I mean by that is that if there is problems I dont want that in our country cause are country is already free so I dont want it to have problems. And then if the United States fight it would not be free so think about that. 
5572	Knowing their vote will not effect they will have less time to pay attention to the campaign than they would have if the president were picked by popular vote. 
5573	By the way plurality means that when a candidate receive more votes than other candidates while not receiving a clear majority of votes. I think without plurality we would not have a president. Voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election. You have to be 18 to vote in a election to choose your president. 
5574	The popular vote was very close in florida. Nevertheless obama, who won that vote, got 29 electoral votes. So, other thing equal, a large state gets more attention from presidential candidates in a campaign than a small state does. So in other words a big state gets more votes than a small state does 
5575	to clean up the school would help then people would do it but if it involves cleaning then some people will say yes and some no. 
5576	Most all of us have has known that mars broke away from the sun that is why it is so hot there. 
5577	Mars is a big hit in movies, books, magazines, and talk raidio shows.  Some of the people that has went to Mars have taken pictured of what looks like faces in the outer layer of the planet.  
5578	That is all i have to say about this topic of Mars.              
5579	It would be better to have them at use in school because than students that want to learn can and the students that don't want to learn repeat the same classes until they pay attention enough to pass there class. 
5580	Plus for example in wich no candidate recieves a majority of the votes cast and should be kept this is Given that the votes outway the elctorial vote with the process of the college electorial vote enshuring a fair election 
5581	Our system of driving has been implemented for a long time now.  Driverless cars would be a huge leap in technology.  There are so many cars on the road right now that require drivers and almost next to no selfdriving cars. 
5582	But if they really wanted to participate, they can all work hard to get their grades up. 
5583	If aliens did make this 
5584	And we also have a satilite up in space and I bet you Countries like Russia, Canada, and probaly even the British have one up in space. 
5585	"And if something like that happened I would hope one of those satilites would see that happing.  And for all you and me now is that are moon has craters in it. Right? So craters happen ever day so could something like this happen I would think so.  And NASA also said that they did there reserach by pictures taken by the space shuttles and very accurte drawing of the ""Face"" not done by conserise theroys. "
5586	Hello, my name is Lisa, and i'm a scientist here at NASA. I have heard that you claim that aliens have created this landform we found on Mars.  
5587	I want to have this experience of not coming at the school and take my classes in online and I want to learn new things to develop my abilities. It's a good idea to know that we have more options to take classes when we take classes from home we have the advantage to sleep more. Students would benefit in this way because we want to do different things and not come to the school almost all day. For example:Â I want to travel but i can't because I have to come at the school. 
5588	TheÂ  electoralÂ  collegeÂ  isÂ  whereÂ  peopleÂ  goÂ  toÂ  voteÂ  forÂ  PresidentÂ  andÂ  alsoÂ  ourÂ  viceÂ  President. EachÂ  canidateÂ  hasÂ  hisÂ  orÂ  herÂ  ownÂ  groupÂ  ofÂ  electors. EveryÂ  electorÂ  is choosenÂ  byÂ  theÂ  canidate'sÂ  politicalÂ  party.Â  AlsoÂ  eachÂ  electorÂ  isÂ  carefullyÂ  selectedÂ  and areÂ  awareÂ  ofÂ  thierÂ  responsibilties.Â  OunceÂ  youÂ  voteÂ  forÂ  yourÂ  canidateÂ  youÂ  areÂ  actually votingÂ  forÂ  theÂ  canidatesÂ  electors. WhichÂ  helpsÂ  theÂ  state'sÂ  electorsÂ  chooseÂ  whoÂ  isÂ  fit for president.Â  TheÂ  presidentialÂ  electionÂ  happensÂ  everyÂ  fourÂ  yearsÂ  onÂ  aÂ  tuesdayÂ  in Novemeber. ThereÂ  areÂ  atÂ  leastÂ  538Â  elector'sÂ  thatÂ  atendÂ  theÂ  ElectoralÂ  college. Also thereÂ  hasÂ  toÂ  beÂ  atÂ  leastÂ  270Â  votesÂ  toÂ  electÂ  theÂ  president. 
5589	PeopleÂ  mayÂ  thinkÂ  whenÂ  theyÂ  goÂ  outÂ  toÂ  voteÂ  for ourÂ  newÂ  presidentÂ  theyÂ  areÂ  voting forÂ  thatÂ  oneÂ  personÂ  butÂ  they'reÂ  not, youÂ  areÂ  actualyÂ  votingÂ  forÂ  aÂ  bunchÂ  ofÂ  electors. ThereÂ  isÂ  aÂ  groupÂ  ofÂ  peopleÂ  fromÂ  theÂ  govermentÂ  thatÂ  getÂ  togetherÂ  andÂ  selectÂ  each electorÂ  thatÂ  isÂ  trustedÂ  toÂ  voteÂ  forÂ  theÂ  party'sÂ  nominee 
5590	OneÂ  isÂ  certaintyÂ  ofÂ  outcome

5592	swingÂ  staes, 
5593	big states 
5594	avoidÂ  run-offÂ  elections. 
5595	I also, think that with more freedom would become more responsibility, and i think that the students in the school could handle having their cell phones out during passing time and also during lunch periods. Many people would like to have that freedom of having our cell phones out. Also, i think that if we were able to have our cell phones and do things with them then we would be a lot happier and things would be a lot better at Warren Woods Middle  School 
5596	A lot of other issues should be viewed as more urgent to take care of, than the development of cars that do not need people behind the wheel and in control. They will only cause problems, because they can easily get into accidents, among many other issues. It was just spoken about this week in the news: Google's car got into its first accident. 
5597	They need humans to do certain things for them behind the wheel, such as navigating crash scenes. What happens if a driver who is bored while their car drives for them forgets to be paying attention? 
5598	when all these thousands of people vote they votes should actually count not just have people vote and then the only votes that count is the people in some court room that have more business people come in to vote and only there's count 
5599	The winner of the election is the most important one because he is the main focu now because his votes were more popular of just alot more than the other person, but thats what i want to talk about. even though the winner won he still have to pay attention to the other candidates but they should have a system that protects the winner files and have people haves a good watch on the people who is elected to see what their background life is like their history and what they do everyday to make sure that person isn't trying no horrible plan for something.    
5600	The Electoral College is widely regarded as an anchorism, a non-democratic method of selecting a president 
5601	Some students would disagree with this 
5602	Allowing them to use their cell phones during lunch and free time will have the opposite affect of what is meant of Policy 1.  
5603	It helps use with our votes. If we lose it certain American citizens votes will not be counted in for the president election 
5604	I believe that we American citizens should be able to vote. Our votes should all matter. We as a nation are one. One vote we all should be able to vote. 
5605	To begin with,  We hold our next presidnet in our hands. Thats why we should change the election by popular votes 
5606	If everybody over the age of 21 votes all of our votes would be counted in and we would pick our president 
5607	We should also keep the electrol college so congress helps our nation to vote also 
5608	Because if we give this country over to the wrong president our country could fall and we could go under. One of the reasons that our country is still standing today is because we as a nation have pick a great president, without hessition. Back in the old days we didnt have a right to vote. We are blessed to be able to vote and a system like the electrol college today. If we lose the electrol college we lose hope and faith that our country we be still standing.  
5609	In conclusion,  We americans are sometimes not greatful for the things we have but without we are lost. 
5610	Some people don't have respect for the world they live in. 
5611	so that way we don't arguments throughout the states. In the electoral college yoor vote is sent to someone not holding public office. 
5612	When you vote you are getting a slate of the vote and to feel that their vote does not matter, that the new president will have no regard for their interest,is he really your president. The way we vote today is not that best we can do in some ways. I think that we need to have all the voters votes count towards the president that they want. 
5613	The electoral college is based of a winner take all method of awarding electoral votes induces the canidates. 
5614	So for example, say that Californa gets 45 electoral votes and then Columbia has the same amount of voters vote for the president they want they will only gte about 5 to 8 because of the state size. Once again restating that we need to vote for we want to and have everyone's vote coung not just the votes added up and then shrunk to electoral votes 
5615	The elecoral college does some advantages too, but it still has disadvantges. The electoral college isÂ  the president wins by popular vote. The electoral college has a total of 538 electors but, 
5616	The president has their own group of electors which have been chosen by the canidate's political party, but certain state lwas vary on how the electors are selected and what their responsibilities are. The election is every four years on the first Tuesday of November, which gives you time to think who you want to be the next president and cast a vote 
5617	They have many companies who are making driverles cars. The companies beleive that its not the smart car .They belive the roads need to be smarter in general. The roads chould give the car signals from the front of the car. The car read positive and negitive polarity as messages in binary code .They thought the roads wernt going to work but they did.  
5618	As I strongly write this letter, I must ask these questions. Do you think it is necessary to do community service? Do you think it is needed to give back to our communities and just say thank-you? Do you think it is the right thing to do, to love and be proud of our freedom? 
5619	One method of chosing a President is having an electoral college here in the U.S.A.Â  That means, the people vote for a group of electors. Not the candidate running for President. In that group they count in the votes and elect witch candidate would win. 
5620	It's part of the list of rights the people should have. Any one can be a elector. In the past, an elector has change there candiate. so instead of who a person's vote going to who they voted for... it would go to the other candidate. Not everything hat should be right in this world is. 
5621	"When Obama got 61.7 percent and Romney only had 51.3 most electoral votes were on the ""winner-takes-all"" basis. "
5622	Others may say online school isn't beneficial 
5623	I think you are still giving the president to much power still 
5624	By this i mean we should have the right as people i which ever stateto vote for our electors. Having the pesident choose for us although we choose the president to represent us on the first place 
5625	it be easay to tell wtich state voted for the president the most alsoÂ  you don'tÂ  have to recount the votes. 
5626	the electoralÂ  vote caused the 2000 fiasco it was the biggest Election crisisÂ  in a deacadesÂ  whereÂ  they had to recounnt the stat votes and electorsÂ  the system failed to keep count of the votes. 
5627	If we were to keep the electoral college there will countinue to have untrustworthy presidents or irisponsible presidents like obama,george bush jr, or ronald reagen. 
5628	Therefore those are my reasons for wanting to change the system of electoral voting to be changed to popular voteing. 
5629	An electoral college is consists of 538 electors. A majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the president. The electoral college requires a presidential canidate to have trans-regional appeal. No region has enough electoral votes to elect a president.  
5630	Presidents count on mostly big states to vote for them. People in the big states like califorina should be able to choose based on marjority of the votes. 
5631	"Elections are held on Tuesday after the first Monday of November. The way voting is held is when you vote your acutally ""help"" chose your states electors other then choosing then person that you want. Also voting for canidates electors to choose them. "
5632	I do not have a drives license nor do I have a learners permit. If I did have any of the two I would be against the fact about a self driving car. 
5633	Because whats the point of all of our parents and alot of other adults of voting if we can't even get what we want but no it's all up to the electors and congress, ect. like for real what is the point in voting if it isn't a fair shot. 
5634	The Electoral vote consists of 538 electors. The most votes that are needed for being elected for president are 270 votes. Each candidate running for president has his own group of electors. The are generally chisen by the candidate political party so is fare. So Im sure that you are going to consider this and read it because some people dont thhink about it. Some dont know how it works and vote for a new one because it sound better but is not.  I just want to make sure people are inform with. That they read this and tthink about it. This is only held every 4 years on the tuesday after the first monday of november. So you might not want to make a big mistake making this decision. People might think that this is not that big of a deal but it is. This very important for the president and the government. This only happens Every 4 year so you got to wait a long time.  
5635	Taking aways the electoral college is like playing a game that have no obsticles nor opponents to challege you 
5636	Nothing in life is fare or cheep and by only using popular votes is to cheat the candidates of the true experience of running for what they want. If you or me were to run for president I'm sure we would want to have the oppertunity to use the electoral college to our advantage. 
5637	To change the way something has been done for such a long time would be like asking to distroy something and rebiuld it all the way back from the begining. 
5638	I think that as a nation these problems are nothing to us, Why creat a big problem out of a simpler problem when we can just let it be and work our way arround the problems we face together. 
5639	The truth is most of these things do not even have enough evidence to prove what they are saying. They just believe it is true because it is intresting. They do not even have the proof that aliens exist,and as cool as it may seem, it is just not true. I know some people will come to their senses and realize what they are saying when they say that they believe aliens exist and people just look at them like they are stupid. 
5640	But Im sorry to be the bear of bad news, but it is also the truth. 
5641	By not letting kids play sports they will change school to a school that lets them play sports with a c average. 
5642	"""Can you imagine a time in the future when no one buys cars because no one needs them anymore?"" This seems to me like a bad idea. "
5643	its better to the winner to take all 
5644	cause almost half of the population agrred with the candidate thinking and maturity to select whats best to others,but also whe you are voting fot the state elector you cant control their final vote and sometimes you don't choose who you is your state elector and you don't now if he has the best wisenes to decide,if two presidents in popupal vote get close that mean thatÂ  a lot of people agreed with the same person,but that doesnt happen when we have electoral because its just a minimum number and we dont now if everybody in the state really agreed with the representator. 
5645	That will help them a lot. 
5646	Why do you think this is an alien. One reason they would is because of it's shape. Do you have any evidence to prove to that this is an aliens shape. They probably would say no,because I do not see any antenas. That is a big hint to tell if that was an alien or not.  Were's the body all you can see is a face so why assum it's an alien. Perfect good sense would tell you aliens aren't real. It's just a from that was created by natual resources on the planet. Use your research and don't go believing anything crazy. Such,as aliens living on Mars with just a head. I mean use common sense. What do you physically see on an alien. A big head,antena's,body,and wierd looking feet. 
5647	1. They want to try out some different learning strategies.  2. They can apply online.  3. They can try taking some subjects that they like. 
5648	The people that get to vote for one's state might not think about what what the remaining others would want 
5649	Are driverless cars the right choice for our future? 
5650	I think that you need to think about the community service. 
5651	The parents are a very hard subject 
5652	The teachers at school are also a very big subject 
5653	They wouldn't be able to give out as much homework so they would intern have to do more work at school. Doing more work at school would also mean the students would be less happy than they already were knowing that they have to come home just for more community service they had to do. There are some teachers that pretty much just give out homework and that would ruin there whole school year curriculum. 
5654	Ever since the face on Mars was discoverd lots of people thought that their really could be alien life it could be just a natural piece of landform on the planet Mars. 
5655	If you look closley at the 1976 picture its a low quality picture since its from 1976 than twenty-three years later in 1998 it was taken again lots of people who had seen it were not sastisfed it was a winter april in 1998 it was also a cloudy time of year on Mars. Even though the cameras took the picture ten times sharper it had been really cloudy so you could barley see the picture to have real proof if it was created by aliens. Later in 2001 they had gave it a other shot making it the most recent. The 2001 picture had still been some what the same as the 1976 picture 
5656	but they can play sports and anything else they want. 
5657	they don't have the incinive to help because its not required. Honestly, think about this. Jesus helped because he cared. God did not tell Him to come down here and do nothing. He told Him to help the sick, feed the hungry, heal the lepers, and care for the weak. Jesus did all of this stuff and much more because He cared about this stuff, plus He had the incinive to do it because His father told Him to. 
5658	sure some would have there moans and disagreements and maybe not do anything to help 
5659	Secondly, The great points of having the people themselves vote (which i agree with) 
5660	These are some reasons, that you shouldn't do the policy change. 
5661	I believe that all students should be required to do community service, But i also believe that students should not have to be forced to do it, if they choose not to do it then it will be there fault. 
5662	It is my belief that our community could use community service 
5663	Electors come to the campus or a specific area to give their great speech that appeals to what we want to be done just to get our votes. Well Mr. Senator it isn't ok for you and the others in office to just take away Electral College voting. 
5664	"In another article it explains how the year of  ""2000 was a fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century.""  There is a example  Al Gore he won the popular vote but not the presidency .And that majority would have preferred a direct election. Also the electoral voters system voted slate, an example given from the story was if I lived in Texas I would vote for Jonh Kerry, then vote for slate of 34 democratic electorsthat pledged to Kerrry.  "
5665	"Even with great arguments of wiping out Electoral votes , it will still remain  ""unfair outdated and irrational "
5666	""" I see a picture which shows the number of electroal votes that each state is granted. Some states are granted more than other states but that doesn't stop them from voting. There are fueds over the outcome,picking the president, then goes into the swing states, Big states, and run-off elections . "
5667	The Electoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment of the Senate decreed in the Constitution. 
5668	"So, other things being equal, a large state gets more attention from presidential canidates in a campaign than a small state does. Most people vote for a presidant just because everyone else did, his/her race, his/her gender, and other things like that. Voting for that presidant with no knowlage about them or what they are capable of. But people tend to vote for that president out of majority because if 50% of the largest state voted ""yes"" for this president then we vote for him and then he/she is now president and is not doing anything right and "
5669	they think that if you take away this or you do that it will solve the problem. But it won't, it'll only make things worse and upset a lot of people. 
5670	Sometimes the votes get overulled by the popular vote. The electors really only focus on the swing states. That`s just not right at all. 
5671	It doesn`t make any sense to do that. The electors should be voting for who they represent. That just increases my points value. The people should be able to vote for who they want. 
5672	eventually i got a call from NASA they wanted me to join them. They said my work was outstanding and they would love to work with me, my immediate answer was yes. My immediate answer was yes because NASA was my dream job even when i was younger i wanted to be in NASA.  
5673	We began to research even more traveling in space trying to find more clues. 
5674	We had no luck for quite some time until... we had a storm and after that we went back to look and there was another face. We immediately documented the photos and got to writing so we could publish it. 
5675	Everyone believed the movie stars and all those other people becasue they have lots of money but they didnt think about intelligence 
5676	NASA has lots of it i believed the rich people to at first,but i failed to see the intelligence until i started researcing on my own. When I joined NASA i really found the intelligence now im employee of the month for coming up with the idea to go back. 
5677	Everyone else had given up becasue they were upset because they felt as if they let people down. So I decided to go back one more time, and i found what we all were looking for!          
5678	this is a very unfair method because i do agree that every state should be able to vote. it doesnt matter if the state only has a population of twenty. every state should be able to vote for preseident, esspecially if you are old enough to vote. it is only fair. there are states such as rhode island and south carolina that are too small and other 25 of the largest media markets didnt get to vote. this is unfair . the system should start letting at least every state vote. 
5679	The locations of the states help the canidates and the Electoral Colloege states that you have to have transregional appeal.  The swing states such as Florida, are the states presidental canidates pay attention to. The votes there are the ones thats can decide the election. The lager states, due to there large population, also get more Electoral votes. 
5680	The Electoral College is made up of five-hundred thirty-eight electors and all that is need to elect a president is two-hundred seventy electoral votes. The electoral College is the easier and less complicated way of electing a president. 
5681	Your understanding can save all the memories and also can help you in your work or things that you have to do for the improvement,you don't have to do other thing that we don't need,because we only wan't that the government can tell us that we can trust in you and with ours help everybody have the hope in you that the futura that is coming is better than this.  For be honest I wan't to know you for put in order the points that each other have to know and share for the welfare of the state,basically we only have to explain what thing is wrong 
5682	for example , the elections for the presidents,vice presidents and senators in the country and each other of the states and places on it.  
5683	The smallest states in the country can be not used like a thing or somethin like that because although the government says that we are in a samll state we have straights and that straights says that we can be free in the limits that we have. 
5684	My second reason is that the community can benefit from this requirement if you put it into action. 
5685	I am asking you why are you changing that the students should have a grade average of a B to play sports that's I am writing to tell you why it should be changed. 
5686	when he not here playing we have to forfeit the game because its your fault and everyone will boo at you. 
5687	So I gave you reasons why you shouldn't change the sports play to a B average you should have make it until they fail at least.  
5688	I believe that if you accept this policy they can get a-hold of their parents ahead of time instead of waiting until the last minute. 
5689	you wont have to worry about the hassle of having to call parents to come pick up the phone. 
5690	If there are no humans in the car but your car is totaled, how will you change car information? How will you talk to the other person to see whos fault it is at? How would your car drive home if its been in an accident? Driverless cars can not do everything. 
5691	I honestly think this is a waste of time. I meanÂ  what the point of being a democate or a republican. Huh? We all live in the same county, so what's the point of seprating us. I would have been just fine if this article was about something else. I can careless about the government. The goverenment is very indiffernt and keeps lots of secrets from the citizens in this country. 
5692	I can sit here all day and tell you if i agree with this whole Electoral college, but it's irrelavant to me 
5693	I'm not saying that i hate this country, but there are alot of things that I disagree with. America can be very unfair. Yeah yeah, I know i don't live in the worst country ever, but I don't like this passage and I refuse the write an essay about it.  The government don't care about people who are less fortunate. Because it takes to many sacfises to help others in need. The government is indiffernt in so many ways. America works and trade and nagotiate with countries that treat their people wrong.  I may not know alot about the govornment and stuff but i still dislike this country.    
5694	They shouldn't have to help out the community because they aren't a part of it 
5695	"Ifeel that the Electoral college is not a place its a process. The Founding fathers established it in the constitutional as a compromise between the election pf president by vote. See the elctoral college consists of 538 elctors. A majority of 270 elctoral votes is required.  To Begin,Each canidate running for president in your state has his or her own group of electors. these electors are generally chosen by the canidate's political, but as usaul state laws vary on how elcetors sare selected and what thier responsibilities are....  See the presidential election is held every four years on the tueday after novemvber, but what people dont know when you vote for canidates you are actually voting for your canidate's elcetors.  Most feel its ""winner takes-all"" system that awards all electors to the winning presidental canidate; but it's states like Maine and Nebraska each have a variation of ""proprtional representation."" After the presidential elction, your governor prepares a ""Certificate of Ascertainment""Â  listing all of the canidates who ran for president in your state, as well as the names of their respective electors "
5696	Under the electoral college system voters not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president. The electors can be anyone not holding public office. the pickers of first place depends on the state, maybe even state conventions, all these things can help inprove the voting polls and make them quicker    
5697	Yes, I understand that there are really stupid people in this world who make stupid dicisons 
5698	but we should at least get a vote on like new laws or building something new in town. 
5699	If we had votes on things like getting stuff torwn down and building new things it would change atol of places. But becauser of the Electoral College we dont have a final say in anything. 
5700	and I cant change your mind but only tell you that there are things wroung with the Electoral College. One problem with it is that the electors can be anyonenot holding public office. Another problem with it is that each state only casts one vote, A single representative from Wyoming representing 500,000 voters whould have as much to say as the 55 representatives from Califorina who represent 35 million voters. Thats why I think we dont need the Electoral College. 
5701	"How does the idea of cars that are able to be used on it's own sound? As in the article, it states that driving laws want to keep drivers, passengers, and pedestrians safe. If we go ""smart"" everything will be technology based. Which is just one reason for an internet crash and more technical problems. "
5702	We would need to change all the roads and enable electrical cables. 
5703	"Requiring ""massive upgardes to existing roads, something that is simply to expensive to be practical."" "
5704	Republicans would mostly build up the election group. which is over 300 polititions 
5705	but shouldn't be required at least you should wait until the kids are a senior in H.S. to start require community service. 
5706	because first off we're looking way too deep into our system of voting, is it really necessary too compare our states number of votes with another's just to possibly get noticed? 
5707	If they go by Electoral college then Congress would have to count up all the votes. 
5708	Now having a driverless is just insane & lazy 
5709	also phones have been one the worlds greatest inventions. 
5710	helping you community isn't as bad 
5711	Our country is so messed up that we have a lot of our people not working or just getting well-fair. 
5712	To be honest, that isnt fair that they get a vote. Who are they going to choose when it comes to voting? Someone trying to help us move forward or someone making our tax money got to the people who dont want to get off there lazy butt and do something. I do not know 100% of the facts on who can vote or not, but if a bum sitting on state road 70 all day begging for money just so he can go buy beer, seems unfair that he should even get a vote. In my opinion half of the population will end up voting for someone because, of what bad benefits he is offering and then we will be stuck with another bad president for another 4 years! Who knows more about congress then our congress? Lets be a honest here, do we really want all our tax money going to families with 8 kids and cant afford 2 or the bums on the side of the road begging for money or the trashy people hitting up crack ever time they get a little bit of money? Not me! 
5713	But in the end, the president we choose is probably not even going to actually do half the things he promised so who cares? 
5714	If you have all the kids help, maybe we can have an ice-cream day to repay us for all the hard work, so that everyone gets something good out of volunteering to community service. 
5715	If you don't want to make all the kids in the school do community service, then i think you should put up a sign up sheet for students who want to so they can sign up, and have a day or two every week were they leave school for a couple hours to go do some community service with some teachers that volunteers also.  
5716	Reasons why i think you shouldn't require community service because some of us really just want to sleep in the mornings and hang out with friends in the evening we really don't get that in school 
5717	We should not be punished because we don't have the time to help the community. Most student would like too help the community you should look out for those types and ask them and not require the whole school that would be a little too much for some students. 
5718	In conclusion i believe that you as the principle should hold a school wide meeting discussing about helping the community and making a community service club and those that want to join are the one that will do the community service 
5719	Policy one states, students are allowed to bring cell phones to school and only use them during lunch and passing period but phones have to be turned off during class time. Policy two states, students are not allowed to have cell phones at all 
5720	They can stop worrying about foolishness and do their jobs. 
5721	Some people think aliens are not real and some people think aliens are real. The Face on Mars changed after different amount of years. We don't know how it changed and we probably will never know. 
5722	When the camera took the picture, the shadow of either the camera, or something else, made the Face look like a face. The shadow make the rock look like it has eyes, nose, and a mouth.  
5723	No one knows how the face changes, maybe it's aliens, maybe it's natrual to change, maybe it's getting older. 
5724	If aliens were real, then people would think aliens made everything in space and will come to earth to attack and kill us. Aliens are just a myth. People just belive evrything, and/or watch too much TV shows about aliens. 
5725	I think if every student in middle school wrote a paper to a principal saying they would only use their cell phone's for emergency's only then I believe that they might would allow them to stay on and stay with them at school. 
5726	Yes this might be true but what about all the non swing states like for example Texas they could have been careful while voting but Florida was not, then you have Ohio and New Mexico who could have been careful to but compared to Florida their votes get lost even though they were more careful and thoughtout. 
5727	I bet your wondering what a Electoral college is in your head ,  well an Electoral college is not somewhere you go to like a regular college but its a process ,  they established it in constitution as a compromise.  Its where they vote for presidents and vice president including the electoral votes by congress ,  Electoral college consists 538 electors and the majority of 270 electoral votes to elect the president  
5728	"To begin with, every candidate is running for President for your state ,and each of them has their own electors .  After every four years presidential election is held on tuesday after the first monday ,  the fun part is that most states gets a ""winner-take-all"" system that awards all the electors to the winning presidential candidate ,  also your governer prepares a ""Certificate of Ascertainment""  listing all the wonderful candidates who ran for President in your state along with the names of their respective electors .  This year most voters are expecting another close election in the population vote which winners could again lose the presidency.  Under electoral college system some voters don't vote for presidents but vote for a state of electors , if you lived in texas for an example and wanted to vote for someone named John kerry you would vote for a slate of 34 Democratic electors pledged to Kerry .  For the winner-take-all method of the award electoral votes induces the candidates just like in 2012 election .Obama won the vote and got 29 electoral votes ,a large state gets more attention from presidential candidates in the campaign  Nixton in 1968 and Clinton in 1992 both had a 43 pecent plurality of popular votes "
5729	But hopefully you learned about the Electoral College and what it really isÂ  ,and what the electors have to go through to be president. 
5730	"""So, other things being equal, a large state gets more attention from presidential canidates in a campaign than a small state does..."" "
5731	"Meaning,a canidate cannot receives a certain amount of the votes cast. For instance, when a canidate has more votes than other canidates while not receiving a clear majority oof votes. Also in big states ""the Electoral College rebuild some of the weight in the political balance that large states lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment of the senat decreed in the constitution.""[Richard Posner {21}]    "
5732	Some people do community service for school credits. 
5733	it is chosen by a better educated person. 
5734	"Â  ""Certainity of outcome, everyones President, swing states, big states, and avoid run-off elections"" (Posner). The reason is that the winning candidate's share of the Electoral Collage invariably exceeds his share of the popular vote"" (18). ""This is a desirable result because a candidate with only regional appeal is unlikely to be a successful president"" (19). ""...the most thoughtful voters should be the ones to decide the election"" (20). ""So, other things being equal , a large state gets more attention from presidental candidates in a campaign than a small state does..."" (21). ""The Electoral Collage avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate recieves a majority of the votes cast"" (22). "
5735	"Secondly, when voting for Electoral Collage ""you are actually voting for your candidate's electors"" "
5736	"""Each candidate running for President is your state has his or her own group of electors"" (5). ""The electors are generally chosen by the candidate's political party, but state laws vary on how the electors are selected and what their responsibilities are..."" (5). "
5737	It all depends on the ways the student learns. 
5738	There are many people in this world that want change and that includes me, if you would take five minutes out of your day to listen to what I have to say. 
5739	nevertheless the electoral colleges dispute over its outcome is possible, it also nrequires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal, its winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes does induce the candidates, the electoral college also restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states lose by virtue of the mal-appotionment of the senate decreed on the constition, and it avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate recieves a majority of the votes cast.  
5740	according to the gallup poll in 2000, 60 precent of voters would prefer a direct election the electoral college is losing the little defenders it has and due to the spurious arguments the electoral college should be abolished 
5741	I think if people do it online or at home they are not going to make friends. Sometimes is good to make friends because they can help you or be with you in someway is good to go school then taking at home or online. Also if they do it online or at home they are going to be more prepared and ready for wet ever situation because they was putting attention in their lessons. But being in a group in school is more interesting because you can meet new people and don't be alone doing the work but everything have their good choices for do it and people can decide how they want to do it or how much they want lo learn. 
5742	I'm a highschool student who is very involed with polotics and i wanted to write this letter to let you know 
5743	i know most peole or adults that really vote and our into politics would say otherwise 
5744	but i beleive that we should get rid of it and really let the people have a voice and not have a group of people speack for us. 
5745	When i was little they used to tell me that you learn something new evertyday and they were righty i leaen morwe and more everydsy that the electoral cvollege is unconsitional in my eyes 
5746	why have a group ogf peopole speack for us we have avoice we can do it o our own we need to get rid ofg the electo5ral college for good. So that the peoplew of the  United States of America have a say so in who we choose to run our country 
5747	This is what I would say if I had a discussion with a person who believed ''the face'' was created by aliens.   
5748	well that is all i have to say principal.            
5749	Even with cars coming out with new assistant features, no car has yet to be fully driverless, as mentioned in paragraph 7. Even with actions such as steering, accelerating, and braking, the driver still must pay attenion to the road and would have to be notified by the car if a situation occured, also mentioned in paragraph 7. 
5750	Who would be to blame if the car were to wreck, the previously assured driver who believed their car was funtioning properly, or the car that promised to alert the driver if a problem were to arise? This idea is brought up in paragraph 9. 
5751	Many states have made it illegal to even test these driverless cars, according to paragraph 9. These illegal laws could change in the future, however, if driverless cars prove to meet safety standards maybe as that of a regular car.  
5752	they probably think if they liked it change or they don't liked it changed to have least have a B average to participate in sports or other activities. I think some of the students would liked the change and some of the others students probably like about the change of the policy that might be possible to change. I have no idea what they would think about the change to the policy that might be possible to be changing when you can only participate in sports or other activities like clubs and all the other stuff. My friend of mine told me she has a C average in one class and the rest she has like a B average she think she does. She also told me if it does change she would say she don't like the policy being changed. Because she said some students wont liked it any way. She bets some would at least like the idea of changed it to have least a B average. My other friends of mine don't want it to change. I agree with them about it possible about it being changed. 
5753	they want to I know you care for the and our well being the students in the that are doing community is doing the right thing buy doing 
5754	I hope you put my opinion in perspective and will give it some thought. 
5755	And mostly because if we were to change it then the most of the former US Presidents would'nt even be President because of there rivals 
5756	It might look very much like a humans face but they do not believe that. There scientist and they have evidence that it is not human like its just a natural artifact. 
5757	Some people might believe that it is a human face 
5758	but then again that may just be the cheaters. 
5759	The elecotrial College process consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for president and vice president, and the counting of the electorial votes by congress. 
5760	The electorial college consists of 538 electors. A majority of 270 electorial votes is required to elect the president. Your states entitled allotment of electors equals the number of members in its congressional delegation : one for each member in the House of representitives plus two for your senators. 
5761	Accessing to both subjects can not be trusted if the school will be monitoring every movement you take on your device. Testing online can be easy to cheat if the teacher is not around walking and watching what your doing. Students might not know many things but cheating and being sneaky are the two most known words we understand very well. 
5762	Please, get us students to that job. 
5763	I think everyone would agree that community service can get a little annoying 
5764	They can be taught, yes, but if you are trying to do something nice, it should be a kind act on your own.  
5765	If I was a scintst at NASA discussing the Face. I whould have to prove to the person i was discussing with that it was made by it,s self not alien to do that i need facts about mars. 
5766	In paragraph 3 the passege stated that a few days later NASA unveiled the image for all to to see the caption noted a huge rock formation. Which resembles a human head form by shadows giving the illusion eys nose and mouth. the authors resoned it whould ba good way to engage the public and attract attetion to mars.  Like the authors want to do mars became popualr in pargraph 5 it stated that The Face on Mars had became a pop icon it has starred in a hollywhood film appeared in books, magazines, radio taalk shows even haunted grocery store check out lines for 25 years. Some people think the Face bona fide evidence of life on Mars evidence NASA whould rather hide.  Some people belived the Face was an alien artifact photographing cydonia became a prioriy for NASA when mars Global Surveyor arrived at the red planet in Sept. 1997 eighteen long years after the. Viking missions eneded people felt that was important to taxpayers.         
5767	It seems as if the passage is more in favor of elections based on the electoral college votes. The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. At the most basic level,the electoral college is unfair to voters because it's a winners takes all system. The electoral colllege consists of 538 electors. A majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect your president. The elctoral college is anachronism and it's time we should be open minded and look in to the future and rely on the Americans votes we should not rely on 538 people to vote for the millions of people we have in America. Even if we had a combination ofÂ  the popular vote with elctoral college that would make it more fair than just having the electoral college pick the president they want in office. 
5768	Instead of relying on this piece of history lets rely on bring cheap clothes,food,and gas prices back. 
5769	All or most of the students like to be involved in a lot of things and do something that they enjoy doing or like to do. 
5770	People have long dreamed of driverless cars, and the human race is known for making dreams into realality. For a long time driverless cars have only been seen in television shows and movies, but now big name companies are working hard to solve the probelms that face smart cars to make it come true. This dream is nothing new, and was first tested in 1950s by GM. 
5771	I'ts seen both ways but is there anything we can do about it? Good or Bad 
5772	they also would provide many more opportunities for people all over the world 
5773	Us as a NASA team we work hard to solve what it was such as reasearch, scientists working, and our team that snapped the picture. 
5774	Example like what happen to Colorado. It use to have a river but after years the water started to evaperate and it started forming big giant rocks 
5775	"It would be fare to other kids if you put "" you cant play any sports unless you have a B average or more"" "
5776	say they can have a C average in their grade the school would be a lot better place and wouldn't be as boring as it is. 
5777	all the student would want to change that other than the really smart students who have A averages, but that isn't the case here. its just wouldn't be fair to all the other student who liked sports in that school. 
5778	All people are entitled to an opinion 
5779	You can work at a soup kitchen at lunch or set up fund raisers for people with special needs. 
5780	Well I think its not, it's widely regarded as a thing that seems to belong to the past but also not to fit in the president. 
5781	The electors are the ones who elect for the president not the people. When we vote for a presidential candidate we're basically voting for a slate of electors. The residents of the other regions are most likely feel that their votes don't count and that the new president will have no intersts, also that he really isn'tÂ  their president. 
5782	Keeping the electoral college is the best idea. Some people might not like it but some would. 
5783	Others might not like the idea of voting by popular votes for who can be president. Also under the amendment of the constituation, the district of Columbia is allocated three elctors and treated like a state of purposes of the electral college. Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president. Unlike the others. They just vote by how big the state is and by how many repesenitives there are. 
5784	the voters in the toss up states are more likey to pay attention to the campaign, knowing their going to decide the elections. but the most thoughtful voters should be the ones the decides the elections not the electors.    
5785	So I don't know if it is such a great idea to change the policy and make it so you need at least a B 
5786	and practical 
5787	For example, Obama recieved 61.7 percent of popular votes compared to 51.3 percent of popular votes for him and Romney. It is possible that the winner of electoral will not win due to the national popular vote. 
5788	The should favor in changing th election by popular vote since the electoral college is practical. It is practical because they avoid problems in the election. 
5789	The arguments in favor mostly assertions without much basis in reality and the arguments against direct elections are spurious at best. 
5790	In swing states there are thoughtful votes. the winner take all method of awarding electoral votes induces the candidates to focus their campaign efforts on the toss up states. They mostly focus on the swing states. The toss up states pay more attention to the campaign, realling listening to the competing candidates. 
5791	Dear Mr Sentor Of Flordia.  The land of the free, the beauty, and streets paved with gold. Thats what people think of this amazing country. The Systems we have here works even know we get insults from around that world. USA changed the world. Back a long time ago back when the application mountains was the border, this land was govered wrongly. It was a long and painful war, alot of blood was spilled, alot of tears were shed. but our for fathers founded this counrty right. Since then changes were made in our laws that helped this courty, but we should never change this goverment. 
5792	I love the Electoral collage system, i cant believe anyone would want to chage or modife it. I think this is the perfect way. 
5793	Fanily There arw no run off elections thank god for that.  
5794	The election is an very imoportant thing that everyone really needs to pay attention to it can interfere with us or it can be a good thing for some people. we should not vote for the person wants to make our lifes difficult and miserable and want to take away things like medical insurance and weak for a new born. 
5795	To start off with,we should not just pick a random person who looks like there going to be a good president of a good vice president. 
5796	"In source 3 it says that,""It can be argued that the electoral college method of selecting the president may turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state-Democrats in texas."" "
5797	To conclude my essay,we should not let any person win all votes and turn everything around for people. 
5798	it needs to help not cause any confusion and not take away important needs in life 
5799	"I just want end my essay off with an quote ""if anyone has a good argument for putting the fate of the presidency i the hands of a few swing voters in ohio, they have yet to make it....    "
5800	because we have a lot of close presedential race nowadays. 
5801	Big states: 
5802	The electoral college avoids the problem of elections in which no canidate recieves a majority of the votes cast. 
5803	5. Avoid Run-Off Elections: 
5804	It can be argued that the Electoral College method of selecting the president may turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state-democrates in Texas, for example, or Republicans in California. Knowing their vote will have no effect, they have less incentive to pay attention to the compaign than they would have if the president were picked by popular vote. 
5805	the Electoral college consists of 538 electors. A majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the president. Your state's entitled allotment of ellectors equals the number of members in its congressional delegation: one for each member in the house of representatives plus two for you senators.  Under the 23rd Amendment of the constitution, the District of Columbia is allocated 3 electors and treated like a state for purposes of the electoral college. For this reason in the following discussion, the word ''state'' also refers to the district of Columbia. 
5806	Just for 40 minutes (lunch) of our day we want to use our cellular device. Everyone should have a chance at least every other Friday to have there cell phones on during lunch time. 
5807	If that were to happen then the election would be thrown to the House of Representatives, where people in the state would decide on the president. 
5808	No one else should vote for them. The people have the right to choose who ever they want. And no one has the right to vote for any other person but them 
5809	The Electrical College is a process, not a place. The founding fathers established it in the Constitution as a compromise between election of a President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens. 
5810	"The Electoral College process consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for President and Vice President, and the counting of the electoral votes by Congress. Our state's entitled allotmeant of electors equals the number of members in its Congressional delegation: one for each member in the House of Representatives plus two for our Senators.  Each candidate running for President in our state has his or her own group of electors. The electors are generally chosen by the candidiate's political party, but state laws vary on how the electors are selected and what their responsibilities are. Most states have a ""Winner-take-all  "" system that awards al electors to the winning presidential candidate. However, Maine and Nebraska each have a variation of ""proportional representation.""  What have Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and the AFL-CIO all, in their time, agreed on? Answer: Abolishing the electoral college! They're not alone; according to a Gallup poll in 2000, taken shortly after Al Gore- thanks to the quirks of the electoral college- won the popular vote but lost the presidency, over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now. Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the President, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the President. Sometimes state conventions, sometimes the state party's central commitee, sometimes the Presidential candidates themselves. The single best argument against the electoral college is what they might call the disaster factor. Perhaps most worrying is the prospct of a tie in the electoral vote. At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters.  The Electoral College is widely regarded as an anarchronism, a non-democratic method of selecting a President and ought to be [overruled] by declaring the candidate who recieves the most popular votes the winner. The advocates of this position are correct in arguing that the Electoral College method is not democratic in a modern sense. It is the electors who elect the the President, nort the people. When you vote for a Presidential candidate you're actually voting for a slate of electors. Yet this has happened very rarely. It happend in 2000, when Gore had more popular votes yet fewer electoral votes, but that was the first time since 1888. There are 5  reasons for retaining the Electoral College despite its lack of Democratic pedigree  Certainty of Outcome  Everyone's President  Swing States  Big Sates  Avoid Run-Off Elections        "
5811	I believe that kids in 7th to 12th grade should learn how to do service 
5812	On the other hand. If you are at home you can eat and do whatever you want when you want. 
5813	but I would make a few changes to it the first thing I would change about it would be during class teachers or staff should check the phones to see if they are turned off. 
5814	The other thing I would change about is, teachers and staff should keep watch on their students if they are using their cell-phone in class because sometimes they cannot be trusted. 
5815	The country is based on our votes and that is how it should be because we are part of this country and we make it a free country. 
5816	This is how our founding fathers stated this country and thats how it need to be our country has the best presedent that we could have in this type of situation because he is a colored man and there is nothing wrong with that.Â If we did not have an electoral collage it would be harded to keep things in line such as how the voting works and how it should be decided that we have the best presedent we canÂ get at that time for our country. As an example we have been fighting on Iran and alfaganastan for a long time and presedent oboma did the best he could with the best that he had to make sure that we were still a free country and the we were safe from terrorism. The electoral collage was a good iead and still is so thst way we do always have a good presedent or for anything that this country need to vote on it always keeps thing in order and fair to this country so there for it is what this country need in order to make the best we can with the best we got.    
5817	Obviously the system has its flaws 
5818	but nothing is perfect. Sure the Electoral College messed up twice, but that isn't some mass amount that was detrimental to our nation. 
5819	If diverless cars are in our future would it impact the way people focuse on the road? 
5820	"I mean if we're going to be judged be our peers shouldnt we be elected by them to. When it comes down to it who exactle is voting for us and can we control who we'er voting for and from the evedence shown in ""What's wrong with the electoral college"" no we can't. And no matter who are what we vote for all were doing is expressing a political preference it dosent matter at all to them what we want all they care about is what they want and what they think is best. When it my be best for them but not for the rest of us. "
5821	If we'er all going to have to live with who wins for the next four years shouldnt we all get a vote.    
5822	How do feel about driverless cars? 
5823	Driverless cars are for the future, but anything is possible for the future. 
5824	"There are many possible things that could happen. The car could be a succesful invention. Then again it could be a failure. Nobody wants to be in harms way right? In the passage it says "" Mercedes-Benz, Audi, and Nissan plan to have cars that can drive themselves by 2020"" to me I think it will take more than four years to invent these cars and mass produce them. "
5825	"the passage goes on and says "" If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault-the driver or the manufacturer?"" What if one of the sensors become defaulted? Wouldn't that be a manufacturing problem? "
5826	What would you do if you was driving a driverless car and it maulfunctions and crashes into the car next to you and you find out the people in the other car are dead? Would you feel quilty or would you not? Driverless cars can be the future, but I think the inventioina and concept of the car shoukd be taken more serious. To me the maufacturers are just looking to make money.  To me as a person i take safety very serious. I think the safety concept of the vehicles should be one of the more serious things the manufacturers should look at if produced. They should only give a certain amount of driverless cars out incase the technology fails. There won't be much chaos if the technology malfunctions. 
5827	"Althogh few scientists believed the Face was an alien artifact, photographing Cydonia became a priority for the NASA when the Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) arrived at the Red Planet in september of 1997, eighteen long years after the viking mission ended. "" We felt this was important to taxpayers,"" Cheif "
5828	because although they lack of democratic pedigree doesnt mean there wont be democrats in the whitehouse, because they have requirements of how to find the best fit no matter what party included.Even if they were unsupportive of the democrats Romney lossed as example of equality of parties on the College's choice. 
5829	Stating that the expierience of the College will prevail on the birth of a new president,no matter what party,no matter the odds of a popularity vote, the Electoral College is a perfect example of this nation's motto because they are truely a sign of equality between candidates that might become great presidents of our nation.  
5830	My Principal wants to change that we must have a B average to be in any sport. 
5831	The electors does that not the citizens they just use the votes and later they would choose who ever they want. My opinion is to take the Eletoral College away for good because is useless and pointless. 
5832	"Five reasons why the Electora College should be restained despite its lack of democratic."" The winners takes all bases"". What is that, why would we use that. In 2012 President Obama received 61.7% of the electoral votes compared to only 51.3% of the popular votes cast for him and Romney, says in source 3: In defence of the Electoral College. My point here is that we ""DO NOT"" need the Elecoral College. The voters in presidential elections are people who wants to express aÂ  political preference rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election. "
5833	My answer would be no, because everybody is living in the country that wants a vote from everyone so why only accept the votes that are thoughtful. 
5834	We are all one so we should all vote and choose who we would like as a President of the United State. Â  Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â     
5835	Even now when humans are driving vehicles, but if there is many accidents with humans driving imagine a car driving itself. A car does not have reflexes. Therefore, if an accident happens really quick and the sensors do not alert the driver like it should be then there goes another collision. Many things could go wrong with the sensors and could cause terrible accidents. 
5836	Its not fair that alot of people vote and only about half of their vote counts.  
5837	like the one we have today. 
5838	Under this system, voters vote not for the president, but for the state of electors. which whoÂ  in turn elect the president. For example, if u lived in texas, and wanted to vote for John Kerry, you dont vote for a slate of 34 democratic electors pledged to Kerry. 
5839	Some of us just don't get how that works. What happen in 2000 have me to think that, maybe there are some sercet's that the us is not telling us, because they dont knowÂ  how we are goingÂ  to respond.  There is probably a lot of things that would get a lot of people in trouble. What happen in the 2000 should open a lot of eyes right now. This world is so crazy today. We are trillion of doolars in debt probably because of the stupid disicions that the electoral college made on that day. 
5840	Electoral college is a process of electors and a poupular vote is by the people 
5841	We take education to help us have a brighter future and cell phones may get in the way but if we all come together, our community or even the whole world and help each other out then we can still have a bright future. 
5842	This college basically provides you with a idea of why it is important to vote. The country's fate rests in the hands of many. 
5843	Many people believe that,that should be overruled by declaring the candidate who recieves more popular votes is the winner.Each party selects a slates of electors that is trusted to vote for the nominee that was picked slate electors.Even though the Electoral has a lack of conservative reasons, there are five reasons that people think that should be retained. The first reason is the certainy of outcome,second Everyone's President,third Swing states,fourth Big States,and lastly Avoiding run-off Elections.These 5 things are reasons why people feel that these colleges should stay. 
5844	The electoral college is good but its alot of work to find out who wins the President and Vice President seat. 
5845	and the resoring weight of the eletoral number by population. 
5846	The Electoral College restores and reduces some of the weight of the electoral by its population. 
5847	Aliens could not have made the face becasue it would take to long. 
5848	Here is why NASA is proving facts. This is not possible in any shape, way, or form because it would take over 300 years to do so. You would say that the aliens just bulit it as we bulid buliding today. But, they would have to have constrcution workers working every single day for this to happen and that is why NASA says it is impossible. Together that is why I do not think is is possible.  
5849	In conclusion, aliens do not exist, do not have cababilatlies to make anything to that scale, and it would take to long that is why aliens could not have made this face. People get their hopes up about things to easily that is why NASA does not think any of this is even near possible. It would be better if NASA told evryone the full truth. 
5850	Still the electoral college still has defenders fror themselves 
5851	Even though im all for removing the Electoral College there is positives too 
5852	I do really think that it would be way better to allow them because sometimes in class , my friends and i have our cell phones out i mean what student wouldn't? 
5853	But some students only do it like once or twice like me but other they will just have it out all the time in every class and not pay attention. So that just makes them fail and have to redo everything all over. 
5854	So cleaning up the school will not only help the school , but the wildlife, kids who are over weight and do not get out as much as your suppose to , help kids get along and share what they have in common 
5855	You might even have you parents come out and watch, just be helping out a little can make a big difference. 
5856	i think that this group thinks this because they know how to get around the system or play it. Doing so makes it easy'er for them to have someone that they trust or control on the top of the game 
5857	Even thought I am with the idea i still have to put myself in their shoes because, some of these kids have seen stuff that I never plan on seeing. 
5858	If we are not given the opportunities, we may never know. Not knowing what we can excel at may cause a life of insecurities. Do want to be the one held responsible for something like that? 
5859	"The Electoral College is ""widely regarded as an anachronism"" a non-democratic  method of selecting a president that ought to be over ruled by declaring the canidate who receives the most popular votes the winner. This way it is fair. "
5860	In addition, i also believe that there is no way face could just randomly appear inside of the moon monument because, I think there are no sure thing as aliens. 
5861	And i think that no humans were even exsistent by the time that monument happened. 
5862	We should keep the Electoral College because it is fair and it is going by all of the votes , not just the popular votes. 
5863	"""The Electoral College consists of 538 electors. A majority of 270 electoral votes, is required to elect the President."" "
5864	"When you vote for a presidential candidate you're actually voting for a slate of electors. The Electoral College has a better chance of having an outcome than the popular votes. ""  "
5865	"In 2012's election, for example, Obama recieved 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to only 51.3 percent of the popular votes cast for him and Romney."" "
5866	That is incorrect because the electoral college pays close attention to every state to see which ones would be good to pick 
5867	The Popular States says that the electoral College system is out of date and lame , 
5868	The Electoral College avoids run off elections unlike the popular vote system. 
5869	whereas we already use the popular vote today as a way of forecasting the oucome and seeing the people's real choice. 
5870	it is likely an arguement about the popular vote. 
5871	"NASA received a photo from Viking 1, in 1976, and it appeared to be a face. In 1998, a higher resolution picture came in and in 2001 an even higher resolution picture came in. NASA scientist thought aliens created this. But they didn't it was just a Martian mesa. A few days after they figured out it was a Martian mesa, NASA unveiled the image for all to see. The caption on it noted a ""huge rock formation... which resembles a human head... formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes,nose,and mouth."" Authors reasoned it would be a good way to engage the public and attract attention to Mars. And it certainly did! The  ""Face on Mars"" has since become a pop icon. It starred in a Hollywood film, appears in books, magazines, radio talkshows- even haunted grocery store checkout lines for 25 years! The picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa "
5872	If scientist actually proved aliens are real I'm sure they won't tell the public. 
5873	Is something wrong with cell phones being allowed in school? There is no such accunization. 
5874	The Electoral College is a process of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for President and Vice President, and the counting of the electoral votes by Congress (office of the federal Register 2). 
5875	Arguing about keeping the electoral college would have to be the best oppition 
5876	The process of the electoral college is a meeting of electors that vote forpresident and vice president. I think that the people should help out with this voting like all we do is give them advice. When this is done the people that voted are picking the right person to protect our country. And when we vote for your new president you are actually voting for the candidate's electors 
5877	In maine and nebraska they are differnet form every other state they dont do the winner takes all they have a differnet system. When the president is elected he gets a certifacation of all the people he beat. 
5878	I think thats wrong I think that everyone that fought in this election should get a little thing. 
5879	Jimmy carter, bob dole, and others all agreed that electoral college should be abolished. In this election 60 percant of people voted not to have a electoral college. 
5880	In 2000 there was a election crisis that broke out it was the biggest one. The states leislatures are technically responsible for picking the electors and picking this people they can defy eneyone.  Back in 1960 a louisiana legislature succeeded in replacing the democratic elector with a new one. Electors had refused to vote for their party's candidate and it happened in hawaii 1960. The vice president at the time had made sure that everything was back to normal 
5881	How could aliens make such a thing? There is no way. 
5882	Some scientist believe that the face was an alien artifact, the photographing from Cydonia became a priorty for NASA when MGS showed up at the Red Planet in Sepmber. The face was not created by some things we like to call aliens that we don't even know if they exist or not, kind of like mermiads or unicorns.  
5883	"It was so bi it would take aliens so long to even make this thing we say that looks like a face. Some people belive that the face is ""bona fide"", which means that that face is evidence that there was life on Mars at one point. Nobody has that big of a face for it to be an actual human face. "
5884	The face is exactly located 41 degrees North martian latitude where it was winter in April '98, a very cloudy time on the Red Planet. This investigation the scientist haas said has been very hard work to figure out exaclty what it is. 
5885	I still belive with all the evidence we have it has to just be God's creation and it just apeared to look like a face, no aliens or anything like that because if you want to tell me that aliens did it you better be showing me that aliens even exist first. 
5886	everyones preident 
5887	swing states, 
5888	big states 
5889	There are such things as swing states. Swing states mean that the state is made up of people who are democratic and republican so the state has a mixed variety of voters. Candidates spend a lot of time campagning in these swing states to try and persuade the voters in the state into their favor. 
5890	Some of my reasoning is it is the easiest way to elect someone. 
5891	Second reason is it is very fast quick to elect. 
5892	Final reason is it work fine. My mom always tells me you dont fix whats not broke. 
5893	Then when it stops working we could start a new type of election. Many people have used this type of election the whole life and we still use it today so i think we should keep this way of our elections. 
5894	The first reason is it one of the easiest ways to elcet. 
5895	"In the story it says the ""electoral college process consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors is where they vote for the president and vice president , and the counting of the electoral votes by congress. "
5896	My second reason is it is very fast. 
5897	They get the electoral votes in and start counting. Within a couple of hours they have tha answer. they can find out who wins in just a couple of weeks. 
5898	Offering distance learning classes from home can cause many students being able to stay at home everyday and not attend school. 
5899	when it's snowing outside and you have to walk to school with no buses. mom and dad has to work,live a mile away. Or when your a senior in high school what's the point of doing drivers ed to drive. What if you get a job you far from there how are you going to get to work everyday on time so you want lose your job. If your grandma have to go to the doctor to old to ride the bus hows going to take her for life support. Some one in your family is having a baby and you call 911 they don't get there in time and you don't know how to deliver a baby the what.  Anyone have a stroke in your family 911 doesn't t come in time chance the person dies cause you didn't have a car to save him or her. 
5900	People need cars for important thing in life with out cars the whole world will be walking there whole life. 
5901	Who wants to pass i know i do because i want to get a good job because if you don. t pass your classes then you can't get a good job. 
5902	"The name of the car does not match with the car itself. Why would you buy a "" Driverless car"" when the car is still going to need a driver. That is a waste of money. The ""Driverless Car"" will most likely be more expensive than a normal car. Although the car comes with more features, it does not live up to it's expectations. "
5903	"The U.S is mostly low and middle class people. The driverless car will not be sold as quickly as other cars because the prices of the car will most likely be a mini fortune. Not many people would buy this car. Not many people complain about cars today. People are so used to driving normal cars that they would probably rather drive than pay more money for a car that ""alerts"" the driver. "
5904	I belive that each of the electorates should only have a certin percentage of the votes example: Alaska has 3 electorates, each are assigned 33.33333...% of the population and of course due to the decimals one electorate will have a bit more votes all the votes are then added. 76% voted Republican while 22% voted Democrat and the remaining 2% voted for third parties then the first elector would recive the votes of the 22% and the 2% and do fill up the rest of his 33% he would have 9% Republican his vote goes to the Democrates but the other two are left with only Republicans so there are 2 votes for republicans and the learger the population the more electors because of the increased ammount of citizens that each elector votes on behalf. This way the indivaduals that voted democrate are shown but did not really make as much an impact but it shows and may decide the out come during a tie 
5905	And so the dont spend time in the states because they know they have no chance in winning. And the state might pick a elector that they do not like by accident and mess up their vote. And the electors can only be people not holding public office. They might also choose a certain president because of his or her race.  And the thing is that the people do not choose the president the electors elect the president. Sometimes but it hardly ever happens, the elector chosen would change their vote to the other president. It depends on the state on who would most likely become president because the more people the bigger the vote will be. Also the electoral college method might turn of certain voters. And sometimes no candidate wins the majority vote and this causes pressure and makes it complicated to elect the president.    
5906	The Electoral College is widely regardes a non democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be overruled by declaring the candidate who recieves the most popular votes the winner. Each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee and that trust is rarely betrayed. For example, In 2000, when Gore had more popular votes than Bush yet fewer electoral votes. 
5907	The Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have trans regional appeal. The winner takes all method of awarding electoral votes induces the candidates 
5908	No one is going to vote for somthing as impotant as this for no good reason. They vote and agree for whatever gives them the best intentions. Why disatisfy the people? Shouldnt they get what they want? I mean its for the people isint it? If so, then popular election it is. Think about it. The whole point of even having a president is to control and keep the United States Of America happy. Why do the oppisite? If the people are happy, and there is a comander in cheif, then its a win win situation. Every ones happy. The whole point. Why would anyone try to mess that up and change things causing chaos and unhappiness? I thought it was for the people not aginst the people. Im not wrong, and if it changes and the people are unhappy, do you really think thats going to have a positive impact on the economy and society? Unhapiness, living under terms and conditions thats in no ones favor. Sounds nice 
5909	First of all I think it removes our voting right as an American citizen 
5910	Another thing I would want to change is if the Electoral College is the main vote we should just not vote. Whats the point in wasting our time to vote if it doesent even count 
5911	Finally I think If we could choose the president it would be better becuse the people would get what they want 
5912	If they dont get to choose there leader than there is no point in doing this stuff at all. This should be a real democracy and let the people vote. 
5913	I think that community service is very important 
5914	and because sometimes it gets boring at lunch and i just feel like texting as long as its turned off in class i think we should have them and i think that its crazy because were almost grown and we still have to put phones in the lockers and another reason why i think we should have phones is because what if the school or something happen to the school i wont be able to keep in touch with her and i think some boys try to get a girl number at lunch time so we should have are phones instead of waiting until the afternoon so i can write it down on a slip of paper and i think we should because and because what if we are sick or don't feel good and the teacher wont let us go to the nurse then i should be able to text my mother and tell her that im sick can you come pick me up or bring me some medicine and having a phone in the lunch is phone because when you just feel like you don't wont to be bothered then you can plug in some earphones to your phone listen to music and eat so yes TEACHER_NAME  
5915	i think we should be able to have phones during lunch and any free time we get. 
5916	"The electoral college consists of many electorals. They consist of 538 electorals. Majority of the electoral votesare 270, which is required to elect the President. Under the 23rd Admendment of the Constitution, the District of Cloumbia is allocated 3 electors and treated like a state on purposes of the Electoral College.  Each canidate running for President in your state has his or her own group of electors.  Afte the presidential election, your governor prepares a ""Certificate of Ascertainment "" listing all of the candidates who ran for President n your state along with the names of their respective electors. The Certificate of Ascertainment also declares the winning presidential canidate in your state and shows which electors will represent your state at the meeting of the electors in December of the election year.  Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but forr aslate of electors, who in turn elect the president. If you lived in Texas, for instance, and wanted to vote for [John] Kerry,you'd vote for a slate of 34 Democtratic electors pledged to Kerry. On the off-chance that those electors won the statewide election,they would go to Congress and Kerry would get 34 electoral votes.  It can be argues that the Electoral College method of selecting the president may turn off potential voters for a candiate who has no hope of carrying their state-Democrats on Texas,for example, or Republicans in California. Knowing their vote will have no effect, they have less incentive to pay attention to the campaign than they would have if the president were picked up by popular vote. "
5917	Maybe if you let them more people will listen and not get in as much trouble. 
5918	On the other hand it would be way easier for people to vote. 
5919	Also a majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the president. your states entitled allotment of electors equals the number of members in its congressional delegation. Plus, each candidate running for president in your state has his or her own group of electors. So this would be perfect for everyone to vote.  
5920	After the presidential election, your governor prepares a ' certificate of Ascertainment' listing all of the candidates who ran for president in your state along with the names of their respective electors. The certificate of Ascertainment also declares the winning presidential candidate in your state and shows which electors will represent your state at the meeting of theelectors in december of the election year. Your states certificates of Ascertainments are sent to the congress and the national Archives as part of the offical records of the presidential election. 
5921	Also, most States have a 'winner-take-all' system that awards all the electors to the winning presidential candidate. however, maine and Nebraska each have a variation of 'proportional representation'.  Under the 23rd Amendment of the constitution, the District of columbia is allocated 3 electors and treated like a state for purposes of the Electoral college. For this reason, in the following discussion, the word 'state' also refers to the district of columbia.  
5922	so i really do think that we should keep this it would be a really good thing to keep.  but this is why i think that we should keep it. 
5923	Gravin states that it reminds her\him of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. 
5924	Aliens are not even real. People just think they are real. 
5925	I think it is a natural landform because not even humans could make something that looks just like a persons head that good 
5926	It might be from the Earths winds pushing the sand over and making it look like it a face. It also could be the gravitation pull of the Earth. I think that you should believe that is not aliens because if it was aliens dont you thinl they would be doing more than just that? That means if it reall the aliens who made this they must have a lot of thinking and knowledge about stuff like that. That also means that when earth moves the face moves with the Earth. Does this have anything to do with the man in the moon? 
5927	This process of electoral college does not give the full rights to the voters... its not fair. 
5928	538 electors is consisted of and only 270 electoral votes is required to elect the president. this tells me that NO people can vote 
5929	which really does not give you the right to do that because people have always that right to vote. In addition to that it can lead to a big catastrophe. 
5930	if there was only popular vote then presidential candidates could waste their time on smaller states when they could of been winning larger states. 
5931	Theres so many positive and negative when we imagine the idea of driverless cars. 
5932	With the face on mars no one belived that it was actually a face they thought that it was and ancient monument on mars and when NASA first saw the face on mars they thought that it was the landging place of the viking 1's sister ship the viking 2. Then when they put that photo out of the face on mars people were using it in haunted grocery stores checkout lines, radio talk shows, magazines, books, and hollywood films.  Then even some scientists belived that they face was an alien artifact so when people did not belive them they went and took more picture of the face but it was mars cloudy day and people still did not belive them. So NASA went back for another one but to get a better picture they had to get closer to the face and role the ship twenty five degrees to the center they also had to go over the face very often because it was hard to get the picture.  The spaceship would look over mars like a faxing machine but lucky for them going around the face very often it got to a point to were their was no clouds and they were able to get a good shot of the face. So NASA was able to get a better picture of the face so that people would belive them that it was a face in the surface on mars.  The face was not accutally formed from the viking 2 but from a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same hight as the Face on the moon. So the face on mars was alo just a huge rock formation and the eyes nose and mouth was just an illussion formed from a shadow. Also about the alien articact their was not one they thought that their was a hidden alien artifact and hidden alien marking hidden by the haze. 
5933	Out of the two possible policies you are considering I would have to say that i favor the second 
5934	i don't know we like our phone so we maybe want to use our phone anywhere, any day, any time that why u should let us our phones during school time.  
5935	There's alot of curios case in the U.S.A. 
5936	For example, it's said clearly in the article that for first time in the story of U.S.A there's 2 represents to be president that came from the state of Hawaii in 1960, and those represent was against Jhon F. Kennedy. Or the other case that the Electoral system in those times it was very confused and for each state it represents 1 vote so The legendary John Kerry wins 34 democratics votes. There was alot of controversy. 
5937	But with all those problems, how those U.S.A choose good there presidents? The goverment like there citizen have clearly 5 things (according the article wrote by Richard A. Posner) 
5938	In my opinion, i'm pro with. Is a very nice Goverment and Can helps every country in the world becouse there potential economic that they have.       Â  
5939	They should do community service. 
5940	Community service is actually pretty fun from experience, and i want to clean up litter. 
5941	NASA finnaly figured out it was a natural land form. They even went back more than one time to check and everything still proved it was just a natural landform. 
5942	"""Under the 23rd amendment of the consitution, the district of columbia is allocated 3 electors and treated like a state for purposes of the electoral college"" - the office of federal register. "
5943	Moreover why you have to keep the electoral college is because when they vote for their president they are trusting on their electoral because if they vote for their president they are actually giving a vote to their electors. 
5944	The governor has to prepare the Certificate of Ascertainment.  What the Certificate of Ascertainment do is that it declares the winning presindential of the state and it doesn't just declares who isÂ  the winning presidential it additionaly shows you will electors are going to represent your state atr the meeting of the electorsÂ  in December of the election Year. Finally your state's Certificates of Ascertainment they are sent to the Congress of your country and the National archives it as part of the officialÂ  records of the presidential election. 
5945	It is true that if you change it by popular vote for the president many people is going to like it beacuse they just trust in the suposely best president 
5946	but if you keep the electoral college alot of people prefer vote for their president and at the same time they know they are voting for their electorals so they think is better beacuse maybe their electorals are pretty good like their presindent.  
5947	Hello Mr. senetor, my name is PROPER_NAME and i want to talk about some inportant stuff. 
5948	Its where they vote for the pesident and vice president of United States of America. Now you want to get ride of this great tradistion that we do. 
5949	I know sometimes we might get confused and vote for the wrog candidate. 
5950	But that is not all of us. 
5951	Everyone thinks its a disastor factor. The electoral collage will improve and will keep improving. 
5952	"In the text it says "" The electoral college is widely rgarded as an anachronism, a non-democratic method of selecting a priesedent that ought to be overuled By declaring the candidate who recives the most popular votes the winner . The advocates of this positionare correct in arguuing that the electorl collage method is not democrticin a modern sence. It is the electors who elect th president, not the people . When you vote fora pesidentian candidate youre actually voting for slate of electores."" "
5953	Thats what the text said and we dont want that. Us the people want to vote for who we want to. This will be something big if we can keep this thing going.  
5954	"All of these things are very good for cars and keeping drivers safe but are we close to seeing the ""Driverless Car""? "
5955	Students have their own way of learning, it doesn't matter if its distance learning nor in a classroom. It is how they feel how they enjoy learning 
5956	Electoral Colleges has selection of electors witch makings them vote for the President/Vice President. 
5957	Electoral Colleges process consists the selection of the electors and has a meeting with the electors where they vote for the President and Vice president 
5958	I am righting to you today about about a very important topic, I am here to tell you that 
5959	Us the people of the United States don't even get to vote for our next president directly, you help choose your state's electors when you vote for president because when you vote for your candidate you are actually voting for your candidate's electors.  
5960	"The easiest way to prove that the electoral college must go, is to reveal the facts. In source 2: The Indefensible Electoral College it states ""over sixty percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now"". Multiple icons such as Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and the AFL-CIO have stated they would like to abolish the electoral college as well! "
5961	We now have the majority vote to put an end to the electoral college and the unfair system. 
5962	This way it will teach the students that they shouldn't litter and that it is bad, and damages a lot of our property and if they do it they will have to pay for what they have done and suffer a big punishment. For example if someone throws a drink bottle on the ground it is there responsibility and they should clean it up. 
5963	i think whoever litters should take the punishment of performing this type of action, and clean up our community. 
5964	For example, if one thing in the electoral college is gone, then the whole thing may be affected by it. Also if theres no Electoral College then they wouldn't be any electors to select from and no counting of the electoral votes by congress. 
5965	My last and finale example the second picrure they took wasnt that blury but wasnt clear and was not too far but not close enough. This finale example shows how during this photo cameras where not at there best but not at there worst they were in the middle. 
5966	These example show how cameras effected the photo.        
5967	You can't expect that from every single student. 
5968	I don't like that. I know it's not my call of how you do things. All of that was just my opinion. 
5969	The electoral collegeÂ  system should be kept because it was established in the Constitution. It plays a big role in voting. But also should not be kept because voters vote not for president but for slate of electors. 
5970	The electoral college system sholud be kept if it helpÂ  the people 
5971	the votes of the electors so they can total up the scores of the votes. And itÂ  consists of 538 electors but only majority of electoral of 270 is requried to elect the president.  An election is told to be held every four year after the first monday in November.  
5972	These are some reasons why electoral college should and shouldn't be kept and should be changed.      
5973	A electorsÂ  college is a process , not a place. The electoral college was established it is the constitution as a conpromise betweet election of the presendent by a vote in congress and electection of the presendent by a popular vote of qualified citizens. The election college it like what person you want to br the presendent , maybe you dont vote for that person maybe someone will vote for them. youcan votefor anyboby only if you think that person is good for the comminuty. 
5974	You help choose your state electors when you vote for presendent because when you vote for your condidute you are actully voting for your condidate's electors. 
5975	In the story they ask you what is wrong with the electors college. I think the problem is that one the off-change that those electors be anyone not holding public office. 
5976	The single best argument agaisnst the electorsal college is what they might call the disaster factor. they the people in american should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century; the system allows for much worse. is the most worryingÂ  the prospect of s tie in the electoral vote. In that case, the election would be thrwn to the house of representatives, where state delegation vote on the presendent. And the thing is that the senate would choose the vice-presendent. because each state cast only one vote, the single representative from wyoming, representing 5000,000 votes would have sa much say as the 55 representative from carofornia, who represent 35 million votes.    
5977	This is a waste of taxe and government money. If we are going to use our money on something it should be to make gas cheaper, help veterans who are homeless, the wounded warriors who give us the freedom to spend money. 
5978	tree huggers, AKA environmentalists  Anyway they are obsessed with the earth but what they don't get is that big companies are starting to fund research to find greener ways to help the environment so that we can run on electricity. We shouldn't do it because we are kids and we don't have to go and pick up trash in the middle of the road where cars are coming and trucks can hit us. And the government is already slowly demolishing our freedoms to save the little fishies that swim in gutters. They live on algae and stuff so why ban phosphates in dishwasher detergent, or get rid of mercury in light bulbs and have the green light bulbs which shine too bright or too dull. So the government really shouldn't take our rights away. So i say if they are doing something about it we shouldn't have to worry about it. 
5979	So don't force us to do something we don't want to do, or buy something we don't want to buy, or force us to not buy something so we eat with dirty dishes.  
5980	I remember in pre-k no-one wanted to sleep, and now i want to sleep every period and I'm in 8th grade. So seriously, please switch that around. 
5981	"It's possible to build a skyscraper out of gold, but it would probably require more then all the money on earth to afford it. Even if you could build this golden skysraper, what would happen after that? Gold is a rather soft material so it would most likely weather away as time wore on and would eventually collapse, even if it wasn't destroyed what would you do with a golden skyscraper that you couldn't do with a normal one? ""Radar was a device on a hilltop that cost two hundred million dollars. It wasn't something you could buy at a Radio Shack"" "
5982	you might not know what will happen. 
5983	If Bush won because of the Electoral College and not individual votes why did the people even vote?Â  If noone were to vote then we would still have a president because, the Electoral College would just vote for who they wanted instead right? So why must America vote? 
5984	I think its better to be elected by popular votes because people actually like the person for a reason and actually listening to what that person is saying and actually agrees what he saying and they see something in that person instead of just having congress vote count mostly instead of the citizens. 
5985	because its fair as i said before for example what if their was some person running for president and he was not really good to run the United States and yeah some people voted for him but he wasnt as popular but he won the election because of his group itb wouldnt really be fair becauseÂ  the people perferd the other guy better in office. Why because ethier people liked what he had for the states n what he would offer to the people and actually help us live good and thats what is important for the state its all about the people wants because thats how we will live right. 
5986	In the end it would come down to your choice, will you affect people's lives greatly, or will you let our lives continue on like we are? 
5987	I personally think that if we keep the whole Electoral College process our country will improve a lot. 
5988	On the other hand, if we were to use the popular demand process than voters could discriminate against one candidate and choose the other one. 
5989	So even if one candidate gets picked over the other, their is still a lot of voting left to be done. 
5990	There are many other reasons why the Electoral College should be used over the popular demand process. So it shouldnt be hard for you to decide on what process should be used during the Presidential elections. That is why I think the Electoral College process should be used. 
5991	In some cases without the electoral college it could actully make the process because yes they dont have to spend much time campaigning in certain states they get to visit smaller states that tend to get neglected during the campaigns so everyone is more of an informed voter when it comes time to vote 
5992	lets say bob and sally campaing against each other and with out the electoral college they can go ariund to smaller states and the big ones and when the voting results are in yes they can be closer or larger apart you also see how america feels whenit comes to politics, yes you can see it with the electoral college but it is a smaller amount of votes so it will always be close but seeing how america feels isnt as easy. 
5993	The electorian collage is a very popular thing amonst states 
5994	well some states have a just one law for it others are a lot more strict on there laws one of the ways they can win is by a winner take all vote but the other way is by a more popular vote where the people can vote and then the winners of the voting will vote agenst eachother and thoes two states are nebraska and maine 
5995	So what is the electorial collage you might ask well what happends is voters vote not for the president but for a state of electors who in turn elect the president if you lived in texas and voted for john kerry you vote for a state of 34 democratic electors pledged to kerry. on the off chance that thoes electors won the statewide electon they would get 34 electoral votes and kerry would get 34 electoral votes. Â  Â        Â Â Â Â Â  
5996	Do You Know What The Electoral College Is? 
5997	"The electoral college is not a place in united states. It is a process that the founing fathers made a long time ago. When they where first making the congress. It is a election of the presient by popular vote of the people in the united states.  The Electoral college is a process. That consists of people that are in congress that help vote for the Presient and Vice President.  The Electoral college consists of 538 elector, But there must be a majority of the 270 electoral votes to elect the next President. Your state's entitle allotment of electors equal to the members in the congress at a time. There most be one house of representetives plus there most be two senators in each states. In congress to make the vote go though.  Under the 23rd Amendment of the constitution, the District of Columbia is allocateÂ  3 electors. They are treated like they are a state that is in the united states, But most people just call them District of columbia.  Each state has a candidate that running for president in there state. The electors are generally chosen by the candidate's political party, but there a lot of states that are not like that and the vote on who they believe in. Who they think that is going to do the best job as president.  The president election is held every four years. no president can be president more then twice, but there was one person had more then two but that was a thing that happend because there was a war going on.  The presiential election is held every four years on the first tuesday after the first monday on November. you help choose the next president of the united state. but only if you are 18 you can not vote before you are 18.  Most states have a ""winner-take-all"" system that awards alll electors to the winning presient candidate. However, maine and nedraska each have a variation of  "" proportional representation. ""  After the president election, your governor prepares a ""certificate of ascertainment"" listing all of the candidates who ran for president in your along with the names of their respective electors. the certificate of ascertianment also declares the winner of the president election that in there state at the meeting of the electors in december of the election year. your state's certificates of ascertainments are sent to the congress an the national archives as a part of the official records of the presiential election.       Â        Â        Â        Â        Â        Â        Â        Â        Â        Â        Â        Â        Â        Â        Â     "
5998	Here, let me explain it to you guys reeeeeeeeeeeeall simple so you can understand it: 1+1=2. ther ya go. job well done.    
5999	The Electoral College in the other hand, allows votes from states to be made. It is an easier method to get the states to vote for the president, and it takes less time. 
6000	In 1976 a tie would have occured if a merge of 5,559 voters from ohio and 3,687 voters in hawaii voted the other way 
6001	The benifit of having the electoral college is that it is widely regarded as an anachronism, a non democratie method of selecting a president that will handle his job and do what he is supposed to do.  
6002	There is so much more room for improvment but that is not happening. The advances weve made in so many aspects of goverment are not being translated into the electoral college. Its time for a change in our favor. 
6003	"Say if i were to buy a big pizza ,and it was cut into 4 big pices and 8 small. The 8 people ate there pizza but it didnt really matter but when the the other 4 people ate there pizza it did . ok say if i weree to have a even pizzaÂ  4/4Â  . one half where the people and the other half was the big people in charge so u can say....no matter what the people say its only going to have like 25/100 effect.  After reading a text its says ""when you vote for a presidential candidate you're actually vothing for a slate of electors' "
6004	despite its almost happing its not really a good way to do it. amÂ  give i anÂ  exaple Obama recived 61.7 percent of theÂ  electoral vote compared to only 51.3 precent of the popular votes.    
6005	First and formost, Martians have been wafting around the population; because of the amount of time it has been around and all of the conspiracy, this has lead many conspirarists to go to extremes to prove that anything that anyone can believe in is real. 
6006	I think they should 
6007	"because the electoral college is a process not a place. The founding father established it in the constitition as the compromise between election of the President by a popular vote. The electoral college cobsists of 538 electors. A majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the president. Your state's entitles allotment of electors equals the number of members in its congressional delegation: one for each memeber in the house of representatives plus two for your senators. Each candiate running for president in your state has hin or her own group of electors. The Electors are generally chosen by the candidate's political party, but state laws vary on how how the electors are selected and what their responsibilities are.  The presidential election is held every four years on the tuesday after the first monday in november. You help choose your state's electors when you vote for PresidentÂ  because when you vote for your candidateÂ  you actually voting for your candidate's electors. After the presidential election, your governor prepares a ""Certifacte of Ascertainent"" lsiting all of the candidatesÂ  who ran for president in your state alongÂ  with the names of their respective electors. The Certificate of Ascertainment also declares the winning presidential candidate in your state and shows which electors will represent your stateÂ  at the meeting of the electors in december of the election year. Your state's certificates of acertainments are sent to the congres and the national archives as part of the official records of the presential election.  Under the electoral college system, voters not for the president, but for a state of electors, who in turn elect the president. if you lived in texas, for example, and and wanted to vote for john kerry, you'd vote for a slate of democaticÂ  electors pledged to kerry. On the off-chance that those electors won the statewide election, they would go to congress and kerry would get 34 electoral votes. Who are the electors? They can anyone not holding public office it depends on the state. That is how it works this is my reason.    "
6008	The school never answerer the phone so they can talk to parents. That is why we should be aloud to have phone in this hell hole. The teachers would not like that but they could get over it and like it. I don't no why they think we don't take are phone to class because we do. The teachers have there's and they ant aloud to have them. There phone go off and they don't get in trouble like we do. I think that is wrong but you no how they pay each other so they wont right each other up. They don't have the right to play on the phone. 
6009	I think it is wrong for the teachers to take your phone away.  If teachers have there phone we should be aloud to take them away and take them to the principal. If we did that then the teacher would have a problem on picking on us. 
6010	"Therefore many people have different minds set if which they should have Electoral college. Here 's some background information stated in source 1 What Is The Electoral College ""The Electoral College is a process not a place'."" The founding fathers established it in the constitution as a compromise betwwen of the president by a vote in congress and the election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens. "
6011	"Electoral college have different ways and similar ways from changing to the election by the popular for the president of United States.For example states in source one ""The Electoral College consists of the 538 electors"".""A Majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the president."" "
6012	Do you like online classes or going to school? 
6013	Many parents home school their kids. 
6014	we the people we really can't make good decisions. For instance what they say may blind us from the hard on facts and we'll make a horrible decision just because they can manipulate us with words 
6015	We're the ones living here we all have a right too. It doesn't matter if we make poor decisions we're only human that's what we do, that doesn't mean we shouldn't have a say in it 
6016	"""The Electoral College is unfair, outdated, and irrational."" (Bradford Plumer) Sure the Electoral College doesn't normally decide on what we have to say but they should take it in consideration. "
6017	I'm with we should just stay voting for president. 
6018	The reason i say that is because the Electoral college is that we should vote for the voters. But then they could be bad to choose. We all should have a say in voting. we shouldn't vote for the voters. We should vote for the president. As said in these passage i'm reading, it's says that (  under the Electoral college system vote not president, but for a slate of electors, who turn in elect the president.) 
6019	I think we should do both, but the question is should we do Electoral college or we should stick to voting. Well we should stick to voting. 
6020	I'm writing this letter to you Mr. Senator to explain the good and bad effects the Electoral College has.Â  
6021	Multiple occasions have dimmed the surface of our elections where their voices aren't heard 
6022	but the system of voting still stands because most people in America like this way of voting better. 
6023	instead, we have a system where each person votes on a candidate to represent their state in the election. 
6024	Well I hope you go along with the community service idea because I think that its really going to help kids a lot. 
6025	Popular vote is not fair. not everyone is popular in all the states that is why people need the electoral votes so they can get a chance. 
6026	"In source 2: the indefensible electoral college: why even the besy-laid defenses of the system are wrong states ""because of the winner take all system in each state, candidates dont spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the 'swing' states."" "
6027	This is telling me that democratic presidents dont go to republican states, like california, because they already know the republican president won them over without really doing much. Now, if it was a swing state, like florida, then both candidates want to fly over to the states and make sure they give a good speech to get as many electoral votes as possible. 
6028	Now you see Mister Senater, why we need the electoral college system. Without it everything willl be really stressful and everythings already stressful. 
6029	Many say that the Electoral College so not be used anymore, but some will come back and argue that it should be used. 
6030	The Electoral College  NEEDS  to stay. If we get rid of the Electoral College the amount of votes in popular voting would be low to determine who they should pick. The Electoal College is the biggest reason we do so well on presidental winners.  
6031	Many people would most likely say I am wrong to think that way or I am just a kid and I have no idea what I am discussing 
6032	Over years, we voted for the Electoral College it consits of voting for President and Vice President 
6033	"and the counting of the electoral votes by congress, sounds diffict right? well this is how they run things, personally I think we should vote based on popular votes because according to source 2 under ""  what's wrong with the electoral college"" "
6034	not always do we get control whom we vote for , it all depends on the state. 
6035	Lets take a look at the present. President Obama who won the vote, got 29 electoral votes since were a large state we get more votes. take a look at map where its shows the breakdown of the number of electoral votes, it shows each state. many small state have less than 5 electoral votes simply because its not huge, but yet again you're voting for a presidential candidate you're actually voting for a slate of electors 
6036	popular vote was very close in Florida (2012) 
6037	popular votes have a chance and will be picked based on popular vote. In source 3: states that they is no pressure for run-off elections ,It's provided a clear winner , sounds good doesn't it? One single vote can decide an election sounds stressful. Popular votes are bascially stress free and in the Democrats in Texas ,Republicans in californiaÂ  their vote have no effect they leave it to the popular vote. 
6038	Though the electoral college is an anachronism it is not democratic in a modern sense because the electors are the ones who choose the president not us the people though each party has to select of slate of electors who are intrusted to vote for the party's nominee. 
6039	Don't forget to think about my ideas and I hope they put a big difference on you allowing phones to be used during free time like lunch and off during classes. 
6040	Taking out sports and other activities from the school due to grade averages being lower than they should be to even participate in the activities, is a reasonable cause 
6041	"In a electoral college every state gets its own number votes and thats the president and others are voted for today. The electoral college consist of 538 votes and need a majority of 270 for them to get heir winner. Also ""under the 23rd amendmentÂ  of the constitution, the district of coumbia is allocated 3 electors and treated like a state for purpose of the electoral college"". "
6042	our states wouldn't have to have a certain number of votes they can have. The people will do the voting for them. sence the people will be doing the voting for them, whoever will have the majority of the people. on a side note you cant keep everyone happy. but there would be the majority happy. 
6043	the canidate gains no electoral votes by increasing his plurailty. that is a desirable result because a candidate with only regional appeal will umlikely succed to be a president. 
6044	I understand the positive and the negative part of popuar votes and Electoral College. I also understand that just one vote can change hthe futrue of most states. 
6045	It's quite simply one vote makes one person win the presidentcy. 
6046	What if that one vote changes our basic ways to live. What if that one vote can take away some of our rights. What if one vote can make the world turn into yet another great depression. 
6047	"""Because of the winner-take-all system in each state, candidates don't spend time in the states they know they have no chance of winning focusing only on the tight races in the 'swing' states."" "
6048	The Electoral has its flaws but so does the popluar vote. 
6049	Voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a polical prefrence rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election. 
6050	No one wants run-off elections or an uncertainty on the outcome. Everyone want to feel safe that we're going to have a president and have no rebellons for it. 
6051	The system has its flaws but it also has there advantages . 
6052	The Electoral College is a process that consists of the selection of the electors. The Founding Fathers established it in the constitution as a compromise between election of the President. 
6053	"""This is the single best argument against the electoral college is what we might call the disaster fact"". I Think The Disaster Fact is What Has the Office of the Federal Register questioning the Electoral College. Although, The System Allows For Much Worse. "
6054	it's basically a gamble. you come with electors, hope for the best and if your luck is good you leave with a jackpot, but sadly if you dont get the jackpot you lose all. 
6055	"states paragrah 14  Certanity of Outcome, Everyone's President, Swing States, Big States,Avoid Run-Off Elections are the ""Five resons to keep our despised method of choosing the president"", "
6056	These reasons still dont give us any solutions. 
6057	The five reasons arent about being fair its about what comes along withÂ  winner-takes-all. 
6058	I believe that it would be a good policy if students followed this policy, though most student don't follow most of the rules in school anyways. 
6059	This is also another good policy because sometimes the duty aids will make us go back to our seat even if we just wanted to ask a quick question. 
6060	Once I rethink the cell phone policy, I believe it would be better if they kept the original cell phone policy that it has to stay in your locker. 
6061	They are various reasons why students should participate in online classes. 
6062	They are further reasons why students should participate in online classes. 
6063	have you ever wondered how nice community service is? 
6064	ommunity service is probably one of the nicest thing you can do for someone. 
6065	if you pick up trash around the town then you could get the confidence to do so much more. 
6066	This Electoral College process consists of the selection of the electors , the meeting where they vote for President and Vice president , and the counting of the electoral votes by congress . 
6067	These votes are very important because with those votes you are making a very important choice by voting for the president and vice president , it should not stop because you could make a difference with just one vote you never know and you would not Â want just anybody as your president , right ? These electotral votes should not stop . 
6068	This election is held every four years on the tuesday after the first Monday in November 
6069	. If we make a vote for our candidate we are actually voting for our canditate electors , very important. 
6070	"After the presidential election your governor prepares what they callÂ Â "" Certificate of Ascertainment "" , whatÂ is that ?Â  it isÂ listing all of the candidates who ran forÂ President in your state along with the names of their respective electors it is so important because it shows which electors will represent your state at theÂ meeting of the electors in December year . The Certificates of Ascertainments are sent to the congres and the National Archives as part of the official records of the presidential election . "
6071	You can clean up with the littering its not right for the animals to eat our plastic it can kill them and start to clean you're streets. 
6072	I find that would be much easier. people would be able to just vote for whom they wanted and be done with the whole situation. 
6073	I dont think you should abolish the electoral college, after all its not so bad.Â  You should just do better and get all around the United States not just a couple of states, ALL!! 
6074	I suggest that the votes of the people are sent to the electoral college, then the electors vote upon the two presidents. After that, the votes between the two presidents are seperate, while the one vote goes for the president of their chosen and the other vote goes towards the other president of their chosen. This process would make everything fair and the majority of the vote doesn't just counts as state. 
6075	people need to have driverless because it is the next big thing! 
6076	The face shows that it is possible for it to be anything, it could be alien made, but it is highly unlikely. There has not really been any true evidence that aliens exist. 
6077	There is also no completely proof that it is alien proof, and making a face on a planet would not be the best way to comunicate with humans. 
6078	I honestly think that the idea of having All students perform community service may be a good idea, but it can also not be a bad idea. 
6079	There are some students who think the same and want to do the same as others, but there are other students who don't express themselves in that kind of way. 
6080	Because it's a process, without the process of picking out who will be the next president of the United States we would be able too choose a right president, we will choose the light for the people of the United States Of America 
6081	25 years ago NASA says they found the face on Mars. While they were circleing mars with their space drone. It was a short lived suprised because it looked like a natual structure that formed over time. Then a couple days later NASA let the whole world see, if NASA even had the littlest idea that aliens then they would not have released it to the public. The face has become a pop icon that everyone likes. 
6082	This creation really stood out to NASA because they can only see in 2.5km strips amd is mostly made out of Mars dust that surrounds Mars,they had to peer through the wispy clouds just to see it because of how cloudy it is on that side of the planet 
6083	On the other hand i think making us students do community service because if the high school students or maybe middle school student decide to tutor elementary , the education will MOST LIKELY make progress 
6084	"""The popular vote was very close in Florida in 2012; nevertheless Obama, who won that vote, got 29 electoral votes.""  "
6085	There is no doubt that doing online school is much more beneficial then public school.  
6086	The reason why people go out to vote, is because they have a specific person in mind. Although throughout election time, many people are brought to different conclusions that one candidate is better then the other, or they both have their flaws yet, they strongly represent one thing the other candidate dispises. Either way, there are those types of people who just cannot decide. They may be left undecided, and have changed their minds by the time it's ready to vote 
6087	The electoral college doesn't only have a few minor set backs, but it could tarnish out dreams of who we wanted to be president by way more than we could've expected. 
6088	It says that very rarely has this trust been betrayed, only happening in 2000, when Gore was hijacked of his position, and centuries earlier in 1888 
6089	The students should follow Policy 1 , so they can have a time just to themselves and chill. 
6090	I strongly agree with Policy 1. I strongly disagree with Policy 2, kids would get mad more kids would test the school to see if they are serious and then find out the consequences but do it over and over again. 
6091	It keeps a steady stream when it comes time to vote because aslong as someone had 270 votes you know thats who will get picked. so why try changing that and have a whole new system put in and then not know what to do when it comes time to vote. And what if the new system dosent work, what if the new way of the voting process messes with the tallys and they come out wrong and no one will get picked, unlike the other way when u know everything will come out right and u know that we will have a president. I think its fair that they have it set at 270 for voting that way everyone havs a chance to vote instead of it being so low that only a few people get to vote before they shut it down because they have reached there number of tallys that they need.Â  So if they change the number of tallys that a president needs to become president that will be stupid and people will act out on it because they wont think its right, and because the people who didnt vote will not like the fact that they didnt get to put there vote f in before they stoped the voting and because they meet the number that they needed. Its a vote why do they need to title it as a the vote of a president or a popular vote of a president. Why not just vote for there just electors instead of saying vote for your candidate when really you are just voting for the electors. If you are voting for a certin thing there is no reason that u have to re-word it just to vote, if you are voting for something do it the right way instead of changing stuff and making it seem one way when really its the other way. Why should the electoral get just as much as the winning presindent? They are not doing as much as the presidentÂ  and who is helping him out.. so they should not get the same reword.    
6092	In result of this big idea these cars will not come out depending on the company. The first one would be from tesla that can drive 90 percent of the time with autopilot. Other car companies plan to have these types of cars around by the year of 2020. Everyday something new has been made or to the world. We get closer each and everyday to a destination of new product.    
6093	People don't always think that creations like that can be made by a natural landform 
6094	Like if i were on the position of taking online classes, because im working and i don't have that much time i would loved to study when ever i could. 
6095	For Example:  some people that are here in the United States they have to go to school and work after school, and they got to pay rent, send money to their families back in there Contries.  For Example:  Some of the people don't have someone that can take them to school and the school is far away that the buses can not go all the way to their homes.  For Example:  There are some kids that don't go to school, having the school next to them, but there's alot of people out here thet would love to go to school or even take online classes but they can't because some of them are always working, some of them even have two jobs.  For Example: My mom wouold loved to take online classes at less but she can't because she has to work in the very morning like at 7 am, and she comes back like at one she cleans the house and then like at 3pm she goes to her other job and she gets out like at 11:30 pm so she doesn't have time but she would love if she could do it.  For Example: My dad he's going all the way to DC for school because he is taking classes for duster he pays each moth and my dad works to in countruction but weekends she goes to DC the classes start like at 10 and they end like at 1, if you like someting work hard for what you like.  For Example: I have a friend that he takes online he work's everyday, he takes his computer to his work so when he's on break runs to the computer and he starts school online like that someone that wants to progress in this country.Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  
6096	If everybody gets a chance to help out the community I think we should take it! It would be great doing something to give back to our community seeing that not many people are interested in helping out. 
6097	The Electoral College is a process not a place. 
6098	There's nothing wrong wit people voting for the president 
6099	Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, the U.S Chamber of Commerce, and the AFL-CIO, in their time , agreed on? Abolishing the electoral college. Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for the slate of electors, who in turn elect the president.  Who picks the electors? It depends on the state. Sometimes state conventions, sometimes the state party's central comittee, sometimes the presidentail canidates themselves. Voters can't controls whom their electors vote for. Well not always .Voters sometimes get very confused about the votes in vote for the wrong canidate.  The best arguement against the electoral college is called Disater Factor. The Americans should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election in a century. Back in 1960, segregations in Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratics with new electors that would oppose John F. Kennedy.  The Electoral College is widely regarded as an anachronism, a non-democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be overruled by declaring the canidates who recieve the most votes. A dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is possible, it happened in 2000, but it's less likely than a dispute over popular vote.  The Electoral College requires a presidential Canidate to have trans-regional appeal. No other region ( South, Northwest, etc.) has enough electoral votes to elect a president. The winner takes all method of awarding electoral votes. The electoral College avoids the problems of elections in which no canidate recieves a majority of the votes cast. For an example, nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992 both had only a 43 percent plurality of the popular votes.       Â Â Â  
6100	usually there happy with the president they elected which means that the Electoral College process is working 
6101	The electoral college is a unbeneficial way of voting because they may be bias towards the people, for example, one might know what another so it can be considered as favoritism. In a sense this voting system can be manipulated in ones favor. How the voting system works is considered wrong to many Americans. 
6102	The Electoral College helps with a certain percentage of people who aren't giving the best decisions on the candidate they are choosing. 
6103	There are many veiw points of the Electoral College, but most would decied that its unfair, outdated, and irrational. The best arguments in favor of it are mostly assertions whithout much basis in reality. 
6104	People want to have their vocies hear for the country they live in, they want an opinion that matters! You can't have that when someone else is speaking for you...    
6105	because many teenagers think that their cell phone is an extension of their body or something that they need and can not live without 
6106	I think that the reason people are so dependent of their cell phones is because it is a quick and easy way to talk to their friends.  
6107	There was a face on mars 
6108	NASA's took some photos of the face. A lot of people seem to think that it is aliens that made look like face. People knew there most be others living on mars. 
6109	Other knew that it was made by the first humens and to think it look like Egyptian Phareoh. Why was it there and want to know who put there and how did it get there. So did people think is was aliens or humens. 
6110	Was it aliens or just landforms 
6111	To find out that it was just landforms some people want it aliens or first humens. Some what knew what is look like them was (middle butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho). Other knew that was landforms. 
6112	If we chose the popular vote system it would never work out because there would always be people,mostly the ones excluded from voting, that would disagree with the system in general and the standard set on who can or can't vote 
6113	For example,in colonial times only white men who owned land could vote and I am sure that the african americans and the women and even the white men who didn't own land were not too happy with that standard. Of course if we had the popular vote system today,the standard would definitely have to be changed but the people who are excluded wouldn't like the system at all. 
6114	if we adopt the popular vote system, what would happen if only white and black people could vote or only white men. 
6115	There would be udder chaos in America and there would be wrongful deaths and crimes. I would get mad too if i was put in a spot where i was not allowed to vote but some people would take it to the extreme and it probably wouldn't stop until the standard was amended. 
6116	Like if they miss there bus, or if they get sick.  There is no harm if kids use there cell phone during lunch, or there free time at school.  As long as they keep them off during class. No one is being distract. No is being interrupted.  Finally no one is cheating. 
6117	"Because of the winner-take-all system in each states, candidates don't spend time in each state because they know they hvae no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the 'swing' states."". Basically,this is saying that small states don't get to see campaigns or any of that because they're small states so they don't evem get a visit from the elector. "
6118	An example is giving out food to the homeless. By doing this, people who do not get food regularly have the chance to get some for sure. 
6119	Whether the people don't care about who's gonna get it or not going to, it would still be better off voting and trying to get that person elected 
6120	"""..the electoral college is unfair to voters."" All the people want is to be equal and have their rights and in order for them to have rights. Instead, of Congress going with just the populars, they should be able to count up all the people's voting choices and let it decide like that. ""The election is only a few swing voters away from catastrophe."" If the higher people in the Presidency don't take charge soon enough every electoral poll booth we have will turn into a big mess with horrible, unexpected things coming.  "
6121	"If all things were possible, do you really think this world would be having these arguments or 'hard choices'.Â ""A tie in the nationwide electoral vote is possible because the total number of votes is an even number."" Does that mean we should go with the popular votes if it's a tie? Yes, well if it's an even number it happens rarely enough where you don't see it often. ""Voters are the people who want to expressÂ rather than people who think a single vote will decide."" The people eho think one vote will decide more than the other's is wrong because what if that person had expressed their vote and the other choice would've won. "
6122	"""The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational."" Not everything you do will be fair in life. Other words, yes give your opinion and hope that you'll be heard and it will help.    "
6123	teacher asks:  What is an electoral college?  my answer:  The electoral college is a process, not a place... 
6124	"The founding fathers etablished it in the constitution as a compromise between election of the prsident by a vote in congress and election of the president by a popular vote of qualified citizens. The electoral college process consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for president and vice president, and the counting of the electoral votes by congress.  Under the 23rd Admendment of the constitution, the district of columbia is a located 3 electors and treated like a state for purposes of the electoral college. for the reason, in the following discussion, the word ""  state  "" also refers to the district of columbia. The electoral college consists of 538 electors. A majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the president. Your state's entitled allotment of electors equals the number of members in its congressional delegation: one for each member in the house of repersentatives plus two for your senators...  "
6125	But I believe even the best-laid systems can be wrong 
6126	teacher asks:  What Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and the AFL-CIO all, in thier time, agreed on?  My answer:  Abolishing the electoral college!  they're not alone; according to a Gallup poll in 2000, taken shortly after Al Gore- thanks to the quirks of the electoral college- won the popular vote but lost the presidency, over 60 percent of voters would perfer a direct election to the kind we have now. This year voters can expect another close election in which the popular vote winner could again lose the presidency. And yet, the electoral college still has its defenders. what gives?...    
6127	for the reason that student do not to ride the bus and can early to School.  
6128	other good reason that is a good idea to take classes in home is that you mom know that you are in home because a lot of students scape and they mom thing that they are inthe School 
6129	so if peolple attend classes from home mom ready know the his son in home. 
6130	Students may bring there phones to school but they could only use them while there in lunch or any free time. Phones need to be turned off while in class or in the library if not they might get there phone taken away and they need to pick it up at the end of the day. Student's phones must be in their backpacks or in their pockets during class. 
6131	Some of the people yet can'tÂ  vote but they watch the interviews the campains you make. What you are preparing for us for the future for our childrens parents and animals. For every single thing and we judge you the way we think is supposed to be we want our country to be better to be the best . We dont want some people we dont even know how they think to select something for us 
6132	but we all humans and if we make the wrong decition later we can't judge you because we elect our president our ''saver''. 
6133	Voting is a privilage we have it let us use it . Let us pick and make our mistake . Try to tell us by the campians congresist let us know you. The way you think so we can be sure in what hands our putting our futures our sons and daughters future. The electoral collage constists in 538 electors. A majoritiy of 270 electoral votes is requiered to elect the President. The presidential election is held every four years on TusdayÂ  after Monday in Novemeber. New year isn't a new life . The elections is new taxes , new laws, new benefits. Thats a new life .When you vote for a president you vote for your candidate you are actually voting for your candidate's electors. Democrats and Repunblicans they all had have ups and downs . But they still make their elections 
6134	The right to choose something good our badÂ  the right to know what we need and want from the new President. If we choose by popular vote is that more people want somebody because that somebody offers something better. Because everyone or allmost everyone is confident about that man. About what his offering us . Elecitng our president by popular vote ill be a great idea . You will make the people happy. And you are giving us the place as citizens of the United States that we deserved. These is the greates country, this is the best countryÂ  in the hall world everyone want to come here because of the equal rights you give us. Because the liberty of expretion. Thats a previlage . Aren't we allow to use it to the the maximun . This is a free country and we had to fight hard for that our ansesters. Electing our President of the Unirted States by popular vote is the best they could do 
6135	Now I know that ths would be a big thing because it is unconstitutional, so we should have a vote upon what the people think. Whether we should keep up with this electoral college buisness. 
6136	Another thing, why wasn't I, a american, told about all of this. Because my vote probably doesn't even matter now that i think about it, it's probably just a trashed paper that goes toward these electors. How doesd these electors just get chosen, do you wof your way up or you get it if your popular? 
6137	If so that this happened what would happen to the election? 
6138	i don't like the way ur doing things put the school policy at if they go under a d there off the team all my friends have good grades they all play football and basketball and u think they would like it if they got kicked off the team because there grade went under a b 
6139	"for example. In the second article it states that  ""sometimes voters get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate"".  Now that's a problem dont you think! most voters just go with the flow and pick who they're friends pick or they just go out and choose the first person they think is good, And because of that people dont really care about who they pick, Which is a bad thing because they might choose someone who wants to kill off half of the human race. Every one should know who they are voting for and why there voting for that person, because if not then they should just use the popular vote process. "
6140	Furthermore the Electoral College is the stupides thing I ever heard of and i think we should get rid of it 
6141	"I agree with the aritcal ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong,"" because it says, ""that the electoral college says is unfair, outdated, and irrational."" ""Bob Dole was right: Abolish the electoral college."" "
6142	but let me tell you something, YOU'RE WRONG!!!!! 
6143	the electoral college is the most lamest thing 
6144	Students would use their cell phones freely without trying to hide from a teacher or an adult while using a cell phone, without believing they are getting their phone's taken away. 
6145	Selecting the Electors,the meeting for the president and vice president,and the counting of electoral votes by congress is a better idea than 60 percent of votersÂ  prefering a direct election to kind we have now. I understand that under the  Electoral College system,voters vote not for the president but for a slate of electors,who turn elect the president. If you lived in texas for instance and wanted to vote for john kerry you'd vote for a slate of 34 democratic electors pledged to kerry,On the off-chance that those electors won the statewide election they would go to congress and kerry would get 34 lectoral votes. Each candidate running for president in your state has his or her own group of electors. The electors are generally chosen by the candidates,s political party, but state laws vary on how the electors are selected and what their reponsibilities are. At the most basic level the  Electoral College is unfair to voters because of the winner take all system in each state,canidatdes dont spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning.  Election by popular vote for the president of the  United States  Obama received 61.7 percent of the electoral votes compared to only 51.3 percent of the popular votes cast for him and romney becausw almost all states award electoral votes on a winner take all basis even a very slight plurality in a state creates a landslide electoral vote victory in that state. A tie in a nationwide electoral vote is possible because the total number of votes 538 is an even number,but it is highly unlikely but each party selcts a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee it is entirely possible that the winner of the electoral vote will not win the national popular vote. Yet that has happened very rarely. It happened in 2000, when Gore had more popular votes than bush yet fewer electoral votes,but that was the first time since 1888 thats happened. there are five reasons for reraining the electoral college despite its lackof democratic pedigree all practical reasons not liberal or conservative reasons. A disput ove routcome of an electoral college vote is possible it happened in 2000 but it's less likley than a dispute over the popular vote. 
6146	There are smart cars in the world. There have always been smart cars. But, why can't we take it to the next level of not even having to drive anymore? With driverless cars, you can get to places if you're in a hurry, and not even be late. Think of rushing out the door to catch a cab, jumping into the car without even having to stear or anything? It would help a lot of peoples lives especially with time 
6147	I really believe this change in your school's regulation could help your students develop into a fully grade A campus and be even better than before. 
6148	All I'm trying to address her is that we need a clean environment and having kids from all different schools help with community service may be a great way to get in cleaner faster. 
6149	People started to say it came from aliens,I know how crazy. 
6150	Some scientist at NASA even started to believe what the people were saying 
6151	If you're going to make a claim about something you must first have evidence to back-up that claim or it can't be taken as fact, but it doesn't make it untrue or true until there is evidence proving it. Instead of following what you think is true, which is based on opinion because you have no evidence, follow where the evidence leads because you will discover things that you have never knew before. 
6152	but again how can you take that for literal truth? 
6153	Now that you have seen community service from different points of views, you should now consider community service in your school. 
6154	I know some of you is questioning yourselves why would i say something like that and that reason is because I know there's people arguing here in our society about their beliefs in why one person should become president and another arguing why one should become president. 
6155	"In the passage it reads under the 23rd ammendment of the constitution the district of Columbia is allocated 3 electors and treated like a state for purposes of the Electoral Ccllege. But if you ask me me I'll be saying and asking you or in other words the congress why do you guys have to go through all of this just to get to a president electionÂ  and have a president of the United States .It's just some things the world have gone though are totally dramatic and this is the very first thing a person's going to say ""the world's a very corrupt place nowadays""but in my eyes i say that the world can become a better place if the people cooperate togather and stop trying to always slice eachother's throats about a stupid reasoning over a dumb presidential election that the house of representatives have put togather and now they want to act as if they had no par-take in the action going on. So I think the people on our own should be able to vote fo rour own president and not have congress put in there who they think is fit for the position of being president. I state this because the one who always look peaches and cream aint always sugar they say things in the campaigns to get us americans on either sides but when we vote for that one who said he going to stop this and that and then when he get in the chair of being president,they don't do nothing at all "
6156	So i say let America vote for it's own presidency and not the people.    
6157	The Face of Mars is located at 41 degrees north martian latitude, giving them a reason to believe it was an alien artifact. 
6158	The Face on Mars was never an alien monument, even though many people just believed it was. It became famous for it, an once people found out the truth then weren't satified with it. 
6159	My opinion about if we should keep or change the Electoral College is biased. I don't think we should keep or even change it for the president to be elected by a populr vote. The electoral college helps weight the political balance in large states. It also doesn't allow the people to vote for the president. Either way i would be fine with whatever decision happens to the electoral college. I can't chose a way to argue about it cause i go both ways with my arguements. 
6160	The Electoral College is not only for the president when you vote its for the elctors so its important to choose the right president.  
6161	I am writing to you today to tell you that picking up liter would be a good idea 
6162	So these are some of my ideas 
6163	So me personally, I wouldn't use a driverless car as an everyday get around car. I'd probably use it to go around the block or make a quick grocery run. 
6164	I think that our school is not helping enough with the less furniture. 
6165	The two policies are both important to the future of this school. 
6166	Teens these days just aren't caring for our economy, society, etc.  
6167	just because your friends may no wont to do something that doesn't mean that you don't have to either; and also to say that you cant make people do what they don't won't to do and that comment goes to the principle. 
6168	Some kids will ask there parents to transfer school 
6169	how else are we the people vote for the cadidate that we want, I think that the Electoral College is doing us the people a favor of electing our candidates. 
6170	I also think that is better that we have Electoral College to help us and help the cadidates tu become president and return the favor to us by making the world a better place to live. 
6171	if we did't have Electoral College we would't have a president to help our lifes to be better 
6172	United States of America, the land of the people right? When people think of America they think of freedom, so isn't it our job to keep it that way? 
6173	With our electoral college, the people of America aren't truly given the right to where their vote matters. 
6174	and even how unfair it is to our countries voters. 
6175	Overall the electoral college is completely unfair with so many different problems that over rule the right of ther people. 
6176	First of all, What is the electoral college? The Electoral College is a process, not a place. The founding fathers established it in the Constitution as a compromise between election of the president by a vote in Congress and election of the president by a popular vote of qualified citizens.  The Electoral College process consists of the selection of the selectors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for president and vice president,and the counting of the electoral votes by congress. 
6177	In fact it just went to help thier candidate mabey support the Presidents election. Plethora of Catholics voted for Romney to win because Obama supported abortion. We never know if the all the citizens vote could have made romney win because it just goes to help the candidate help the person running for president win. If Romney won 1,000 lives a day could be saved. Obama helped with some problems to though, he made Obama Care, that gave people insurence for less money. Him helping the less furtienate is great. 
6178	You are helping them by choosing wich president will help them and thier family have a better life. The citizens know what they need, they know if Obama is going to help them or not. They know who to vote for because they are providing what they need to live good life. If more citizens vote ofr one president then another, gues what? You just helped more then half of the us a citizens because they knew wich president helped them more. The trouble is out here and you can only fix it with us.  
6179	the by them doin gthis alot of kids can fail reason why i say this things because i know students im am one; that me explain to you why I say this . 
6180	That why I diagree with this students attend schools from home . 
6181	I think that you need put off the Electoral College,and let the people pick for the presidents that they want. 
6182	it gives then an advantage to be smarter and even pass there classmates on class work. public schools are difficult even if you try. some teacher dont know how to teach it in then way that students understand it. that causes students to fail and they may repeat the class.Â    Â  
6183	Most businesses don't allow you to take online classes. They require you to have a certain number of hours in a certain class, and an internship on top of that. 
6184	There will always be the few that counterclaim that online classes are so much better than regular classes, and they might even go as far as claiming that they're a blessing in disguise 
6185	what i mean by that is most of the time no one cares about your opinion or theres and asking them for their opinion can really impact their life a lotÂ because you probably brighten their day by putting a smile on their face. 
6186	when you ask for their opinion they probably want to ask you a question or they probably was thinking about the same question you asked but didnt have anyone to ask because they dont have friends either and now yall are friends and more friends are better than one.  
6187	the different perspectives 
6188	the people the advice is coming from 
6189	say my friend is in a situation and she wanted to let someone down easily so she asked for advice I would say she should follow her heart and do was is best for her because say if one of her friends gave her advice and it was not so good she would feel bad and not want to get advice from that person any more. But if i was going through a situation and it was bad I would rather keep it to myself and follow my heart and not ask people for advice because it might be bad and it would be to much for and it it could to people stressing a little to much or feel embarrassed about the situation. 
6190	When someone is confused like a problem or a situation in life. They're going to want a lot of advices so they could solve that problem 
6191	Asking multiple people for advice can help you in so many ways. 
6192	When I am in school and a teacher starts to lecture, I start to thinking or even go to sleep. 
6193	thinking more diversely goes a long way, and will only help you farther on in life and almost never hurt you.  Also, thinking diversely will help you think in a different way which is very beneficial. That being said, thinking diversely will give you the best understanding of your task and what you are supposed to be doing. that is why seeking multiple opinions will help you make better choices by thinking in a more diverse way. 
6194	ADVICE!! 
6195	To me I still dont think thats enough evidence and detail to say I would stay home. 
6196	They would be outside or somewhere other then working at home before going outside. 
6197	because it at home and it can be eays for the students to work on the class. In school it can be hired for some kids in the classrooms it can be claing for them like in fert of thr class things like at. But home schools or online class can be good in a way no people are alone no laged studnts.  
6198	you should make sure your asking true friend that you know you can count on when you want advice. 
6199	What is distance learning? It is when a child decides to take school from home, online, or have video courses with a teacher. It isn't exactly homeschooling or tutoring, in the sense that instead of having a family member, or specialized teacher come to enlighten; rather, it is when a teacher from the school that the student has probably gone to takes the time to teach one-on-one, along with online courses. 
6200	Doing online classes would be better for the teachers and administration because they wont be dealing with a lot of students and they wont be having to repeat their selfs for those who don't listen and the school would have less cost if there wasnt a lot of students going to school 
6201	They wouldn't have to pay a lot of bills or pay a lot for school food or books , laptops, pencils. notebooks that is a lot of money for the school to buy for the students. Some students dont even bother buying school stuff and the teachers are the ones that have to buy the meterals for the students. They should at least just have school open for the lower grades such as elementray and middle schools because from middle school you learn the same meteral as high school. 
6202	My reason or my thought is, what you cant learn,Â in online classes, and thought what you can do it , doing others wor,k in you free time, and the school has good ideas for student what take,Â classes like after school just in home 
6203	So in my position is that because if you work so is you cant take the class for one hours,Â and you work ,and is more benefit for myself but ,each person has diferent ideas .  Examples:  If you not have work is more time for you ,for what you keep doing you class online.  If you wnat the class . you has more time for to think best for work online and make a good work and your class.  With this examplesÂ are much more for what you take any option or my option what is the best or most better already is in you home .  If you not have time like time complete is for that what you take this option ya what has work and not time like for stay in the school all the time . 
6204	I think whent a teacher saidÂ you need that class is for one reason, and you nedd take that class but you cant took with you teacher what, is most better for you. So and myÂ opinion orÂ my position is take class from home in online, and to much better what ,take video coferencing 
6205	i think is the most important for my work in home and i think what the work in online is not easy so need my time for to think, and good ideas and good answer, and the idea is what you learn with any option you take for this case . The student in this time has more option for any problem . 
6206	But there are many student that need study more in the school or home because the studyÂ for them is most important in the life 
6207	They just doing hard work. One day some peoples visit this village and they deside. They will be teach to them. Then, they are start the classes . Some people think it's crazy. When everybody learning they know it's good for everybody. They takeing online or video class for how they are makeing graden? how they are growing up? how they can't do hard work? First issue is how they thing about that? 
6208	As a result,Â when you have people who are trying to study, you going to be in the mood by doing work and getting homework done. such as, their is a lot of would help other students by homework and other things. 
6209	more information 
6210	several different experiences. 
6211	When should you ask people for advice or their opinions? You can ask whenever you might need it or want it. For example in sports, work, and school. you can ask anyone if they ever need advice. With something or someone, and you can help them by just listening or talking to them about it. And mainly try and understand what they're saying or what they mean about it. It can also make them feel more confident and better than they did before. 
6212	Writing and essay in school can be very stressful and difficult. But you can help someone in school by giving them advice on a essay that they're stressed about or maybe just need some help. Another is taking a test, taking a test is very nerve racking and scary but all you might need to do is just relax take a deep breath and talk to someone and just stay positive. Games in school are fun but someone may need help with a question to get the answer right. If anyone might need help maybe just go over it with them and re-read it so that maybe they can understand and get it quicker, and get the answer right 
6213	Pep talks are also a very good way to figure out what coming that your coaches might be preparing you for in the future or before a game or your about to preform. Being nervous is a huge part of playing sports because you never know what might happen or what could happen so all you need to do is stay positive and ready to improve. 
6214	to the students is not benefit 
6215	this option has benefit, but also not has benefit because for a students is important to take his classes in home but for others not the put importance to the studio. For example: The school to get me the option of study in home i know that not learned and for me is better to study in the school because in home not would putÂ soul the studio. 
6216	The school has much thing that to us the help in the school a few students to take in serious his studio but always a few student that not take in serious his studio sometimes onlyÂ to go to school to trouble. 
6217	you have more ideas 
6218	be more certain 
6219	get a greater understanding of it 
6220	they can also lake classes on what there are going to be on the future it`s would be a great aportunity to learnd bout it . 
6221	the student could get adictive using the tegnology, and it`s cause a lot of problem for him and for his family by not telling him what there have to do. 
6222	Some students this way might not pay attention. Also they can use thier phone or do other stuff while the teacher is teaching and their grades could go down fast. 
6223	So Today some School give you the optionÂ to teach you from School.  
6224	also you get you degree and can Apply to colleges, but, there is the caseÂ that they won't have a healthy and normal life at college.  
6225	but, what are you going to do after finish it?. 
6226	If you don't want toÂ go to School, you must have a reasonable excuse, 
6227	because you have to apply for it, you can not decided that you're not going to School because you don't wan't it, and you want to learn from home. Specially from public school that request a letter and proofs that you can not assist to school, and then They will analyze your case. 
6228	 Today you have the resource to learn from home, you should think about it, don not make mistakes that can affect your life in future. At least you have a special case. There are many solutions that can help you and you can triumph.Â    Â  
6229	They can happen because both of you could like the same handsome and popular boy in school. Fights with your friends can even happen with liitle things like a disagreement and start to fight over that. It happens it's part of life. Another example is you not going to their birthday party last year and you both stop talking to each other. Make it up to her this year and try to plan to go to that brand new amusment or water park that just opened a few days ago.  
6230	To all of the girls out there we all get into bad relationships. I can tell you I have had many of them in my life. We all fall for that cute,pretty, and sinister smile on their face. I have seen it so many times it's unreal to belive that once we say yes we fall into their plan to take our hearts and just tear them to shreds. Boys can be like that. They plan to trap us and never let us go to see the bright beam of love again. Until you meet another one who is more caring and loving and you start to feel that sensation you used to feel and you know you found the right one.  
6231	I will say i suport it but i also dont suport becuas like i said most kids dont do the work but also some do the work. 
6232	Getting more opinions can help you because it can get you more advice and by getting more advice helps the person asking know more. What does it help by asking more than one person it can get you get you more advice just in caseÂ you did not know. 
6233	Not knowing what you want to know can effect you because if you will need to know it. Asking others helps you because it can make what ever your wanting to know easier by getting help and asking. 
6234	but not fully 
6235	I believe that if you get multiple peoples advice 
6236	Thats one reason why asking more than one person can help people make a better choice 
6237	Do you think it is important to seek out advice from more than one person? 
6238	What that means is if you're looking for advice and you get various answers most of the answers may all be the same so you know what to do. Another reason is all of the answers in some way may link to form the same type of advice. 
6239	Hi my name is Generic_Name and i am going to tell you why people ask you for advice and then ask multipleÂ people for advice 
6240	The first reason is useful and the second is for your safety.Â  
6241	but you can't just start blurting out stuff and talk over them you have to wait. Once they finish talking then you can say what you have to say but there still is no guarantee that they will agree with you. 
6242	on my opinion students would not like the idea of taking more time to study, because nowdays students are very busy, stressed, and tired of school, 
6243	they would not like to have to hear more stuff that has to do with school . besides some people are more smart and they could take the class just to see how thats going to help, but sometimes people dont try the stuff and thats why, they never know if they are going to like it or not.  Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students from home by way of online video conferencing 
6244	Students would not get any benefits by taking classes at home because, the online class could be also start teaching the same work that the teacher already teach you, or either the online class could be teaching different ways how to solve a problem that the student will get very stressed and after that its not going to be able to learn something from it and instead helping the student the online class is going to make it more difficult. 
6245	,but, it is not a good idea 
6246	more then one opinion is always going to be better then just one. 
6247	makes it more appealing 
6248	more opinions is better than one 
6249	n conclusion, three good reasons why to get multible opinions is; making it more appealing to a general audience, fill in gaps, and get feedback. 
6250	Some school offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way online or video conferencing because for some students that's the best way to take their classes but for other student is not the best way because some student have to work after school and they have other responsabilities to do 
6251	Some teachers go to students home for the teaching just for one student and focuse to just one student. For Example;Generic_Name every Thusday have teacher she come every Thusday in Generic_Name home and she was help to Generic_Name to all home work. she talk to Generic_Name about home teacher is good then teacher in school because you focuse just for one student but in school you focuse just for maybe twenty students this is to hardc for me.  
6252	Studnets, should go schools this is not matter do you want go home school or normal school. 
6253	some students have some physically problem I think they are need home schools because is easy then school because in school maybe somebody push and like some accident. For the physically students schools home is good because they can learning easly and they can focause better and nobody obsses. 
6254	you had seen a cute girl but you don't know what to do so you need some help to make something and you need advice on how to make it.  Let's say that your in a small town but you just move here and you son had seen a cute girl so he ask he's dad if he knew any advice for him to make a move. He's dad had some good advice but the son want more advice like who do I get her to like me back so we went to get some more advice from is family. The son went to is grandpa first then is uncle and they both said the same thing to but the his dad's advice was totally different. The second week of school the son had had seen her again probablyÂ because she is in his class the day went on and on then the school day's over and the boy went home. Before the boy left the school a different girl came up to him but he rejected her and carried his day back home and told his dad what happened at school. the dad's son sawed his younger brother who is one year younger than him but he sawed him crying so he ask him what had happen at school and the brother told him.  So the brother told his younger brother that his girlfriend just broke up with him and said that the girl that ask you out was my girlfriend. None of this would have happened if you staid in your grade and stayed of moving up two grades and almost taking my girlfriend. The younger brother told that he said no to her and wanted a other girl but not her because he knew that his younger brother was dating her for the past few years. Three years later the brothers are in the same school but different grade the older brother is now one grade above than the younger brother and the younger brother got the girl he had a crush on.  when the two brothers got really old and they had to use wheel chairs to get where their going the brothers still had their girlfriends. But the younger brother got married and the other brother did't because his girl died in a hospitalÂ from smoking. Then the older brother died from a car crash by a drunk driver on the interstate and is younger and only brother was very sad when he died so now he is the only boy left in the family besies the dad and uncle oh and the grandpa died to because of age. The young son lived in till he got the age of 56 and his wife died at the age of 54 very sad time at lest they are in one big grave with rest of the family. 
6255	People search for different opinions when trying to make a dission that could help benefit the person. 
6256	People seek multiple opinions for many reasons. The ones I mentioned where ones I find important to most people. 
6257	If you suggests with something you can someone to help you what the problems. 
6258	Learn good education will your brain getting big and very smart person that you already learn.  If you work hard having a job you earned the money that have a more money that you were saving money, don't wasted the money.  Better to be good role model most people try control themselves like if you were having a problem about you emotional can't control, ask your freinds or family help better control.  You can't just stay home and doing nothing only on your phone all day.  The best way is hang out with your friend is will make more energy and enjoy yourself laughs, talking and more happiest emotional.  If you were sick and not feel well just stay home for 24 hour will make you feel better.  The person can't take care of themselves you can go to.  The doctors will help you better and healthy.  Make better situation that which way is better for you like when go to food store buy something you need.  When you find the food path and you don't know which food is good for junk food or healthy food.  When you finish the school and when teacher gave you an homework that due.  When your friend ask you want to hang out for party and you don't know which one is right thing to do.  If the person that you don't know they want to help their work that will make better situation so they really think that you are friendly person ever seen.  When you have families dinner together and some families won't give your food because you're older enough to do yourself just help yourself you don't need your parent give food.  
6259	Make better choice is good for you to be better yourself.  If you change your better life will be easy not hard well maybe is hard for to make better decide.Â  
6260	First of all, the research showing there is a lot of chance to know about the distance. It's hard to make the online or video to offer the distance. 
6261	Because when the students are in online or when they try to make video they are not going to take care them self. For example: I remember when I was six grade my friend PROPER_NAME was making online video. We went to classes from home to know how far it is. On that time she just focus on her video she wasn't focus on her way. After that, she try to cross the way but she still making video. She didn't saw the car she try to cross the road. So,she got some accident because of the video and she just focusing what she is doing. 
6262	The most important way is to offer the distance classes from home is using map. 
6263	It's easy to know how far or how close it is. Other ways, the students have to take care there self when they are in the way because there is a lot of car. 
6264	For example: when I was tine grade I remember my friend PROPER_NAME she was eleven grade.  She try to offer the distance for her friend by making video. When She was school from home. Then, she started showing the way. On that time, she wasn't take care her self because she was focusing the video.  Next, she try to cross the way by raining. She didn't pay attention the way and she got car accident. On that time she passed away she died. 
6265	I agree some students think they would benefits from being able to attend classes from home. 
6266	In conclusion, I don't believe the students would benefits by way of online or video to offer the distance. There is other way to offer the distance from classes to home. 
6267	Out of those opinions, you should narrow those opinions down to just a few. Then, you should compare the other opinions to yours. After that, you can make a better decision. 
6268	It's will be better you do a lot homework. If you have dinner every night, you will have a lot of conversation with your wifeÂ or daughter,Â Since you will be know what your family want and your sentiment with family will be better and better.  
6269	my friend its nspire me the want to study in my home because i want being architect but i need to strain. 
6270	some people need to try new things, becase if we no try new things we can not know to leave they try, because the life its feat of new experiment. 
6271	The next time you ever take advice from one person remember to just ask one more. 
6272	being curious 
6273	relying on your peers. 
6274	Students needs someone who has a degree in teaching. It will be easier for the teachers because they will know what things they have to teach to the certain type of students. They would know how to teach it to them and it will be easier for them to learn the topic 
6275	The teachers on video chat can be a random person off the streets and teach the student the wrong infomation 
6276	when talking about this stuff you need think logical but in end it all add up to everyone else discussion. 
6277	Some may disagree and say that online classes at home are more benefitÂ for students.  
6278	You could ask for an opinion from someone who has been in the same situation as you and they could tell you which choice is the best choice to make that will make everyone happy and no conflict at all. 
6279	Seeking multiple people for advice would make would be helpful sometimes but most of the time it is. Some good advice is that just keep on going or never stop trying because at the end there is going to be a reward and some of the bad one's would be stop trying you're never going to make it 
6280	If you where in school and would have to do the work the next day after you feel better. 
6281	Students use phone they will looking for YouTube,and they learn some think there video. when students doing online classes attend if they didn't know that they will be taping the Google and students get some information.  
6282	if that time students have online classes students doing homework and project,assessment at hospital and at home. Students sitting in the hospital they are boring if students have some attend class they are doing some online classes. And they students have time going to fast. Students attend classes finish they doing some plan. But, students doesn't to make plant January is to rarely to know this information because, students plan after depend school on there teacher and consular. And summer , winter vacation too and there plane my be change. So, students,would benefit from being able to attend classes from at home. 
6283	Do you know whats great once in a while advice. 
6284	why is advice so great advice is great because. You and someone else are interacting with one another giving eachother more and more ideas to do whatever you would like. 
6285	Students would benefit and not benefit from being able to attend classes from home 
6286	better options 
6287	Some Schools offter distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. 
6288	Students feel more pressure at home. But students can get relaxing at home. 
6289	get more opinions 
6290	makes then think about what they are doing 
6291	helps decide what to do. 
6292	Online classes is a choiceÂ for some student's that attend school or an college 
6293	In an online class students might have a chance of learning faster. Online class are good for student's that are shy or can't speak. There are difference reasons why student's use online classes. If you take an online class you can do difference actives all day. 
6294	Student's that take an online class I can call them smarter than me 
6295	I feel like if you take an online class you have a greater chance of pasting to the next grade than me. I have an good and bad response to online classes. In an online class you have no consequences like student's in school have. Online classes is unique because you do what you want when you want. 
6296	When you ask for advice you can get many opinions. 
6297	When people ask for advice they sometimes talk to more than one person. 
6298	They probly ask more than 1 person becuase they want to see what different answer they can get. They also may becuase they might have a problem going on and don't know what to do and ask for help and advice. They also may be in a serious siuwation and need advice badly to make their next more. 
6299	People ask for more than 1 person for advice because they will get different ansers every time.  i think its good to ask for advice when you need it.   Â Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â Â    Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  
6300	Another big one is the people you talk to about your decisions. 
6301	There may be people who disagree 
6302	Some kids never wanna get up and come to school so they end up skipping school. 
6303	"So having this ""Distance Learning"" stuff is a wonderful thing to have. Even when kids dont wanna come to school they can still learn and get there education from the comfort of there own home.  "
6304	 When doing home bound, you get assigned to a teacher and they pick up your work for you and come to your home or where ever else yall wanna meet and do the work together in caseÂ the student has any questions. 
6305	The students and teacher would meet at least twice a week so the teacher can teach the student a new lesson on what they are teaching in school. The one bad thing about home bound is that you cant work while on home bound. Although not being able to work isnt that much of a problem for students on home bound. 
6306	Students that get home schooled by there parents or another adult have a little bit more freedom then kids on home bound because they have teachers that check on them and make sure they are doing there work and turning it in on time. 
6307	I believe home schooling and or home bound is a wonderful thing to have for kids. I feel that we learn better when were alone and get to study a subject or unit as long as we need so we know it. In school units get taught so fast that students that learn slower than others dont really have a chance to get to know it. In conclusion i love the fact that we have al these different opertunitys for everyone.   Â  Â Â    Â  Â  Â  Â  
6308	Many people have very good decision making skills and help from those people can help you evaluate your decision and help you make a final decision. 
6309	if they are old they can choose what they want, they have to think very careful 
6310	if they said yes they want to take class form online ,Â is going to be more easy from them because they do not have a job or they do not have to take care, they can do it they have a lot of time in the world if they do not have any computer thats is going to be a really good problem form them because they do not have school open or they do not have the materials they want for learn, they have to look for job but sometimes if your looking for a job they need to know how you was in school they need to see you record, you are going to need in the future. 
6311	Is good idea if they do this in college for students they work they know, they have more responsibility.  
6312	and learning more about what do you want in the future ,the things and feelings ,ideas and occurrences ,memories and expectations and possibilities ,fear desires ,delight the smallest and most ordinary issues of our lives as well as the large and mostpowerful ones. 
6313	then online web is the tools for study we have that permit us to share with others what is really going on inside our minds and hearts .they are the only intruments that reveal whether speaks and writes 
6314	Second, even though school are welcome you to come, but somehow the weather, the distance or something about personal that make you not able to come to schools, and the better options for you that are stay at home and learning from online or conferencing 
6315	Finally, I think we should put the option about the classes online for only the people who are not able to go any where, not for normal people. In that way we can balance between these two, and every student can study in the better way. 
6316	They will finish early and they start doing another stuff. Students can get more opportunity to do better job. Student should have opportunity to take online class and Done with their work and have time to rest. Being happy. Being smart. 
6317	For example, When students before taking online class they pay for it. So they will take care of about the subject. 
6318	However, Students have time to study. When he study at home, the place is quit that can he focus in studying, then he will be smart and good thinker. When youÂ do by yourself you will have much confidence. Being confidence by yourself. Being Good thinker. Being work harder. Being developing skill of studying and developing knowledge. 
6319	Students know what to do so, If they want to take their time, online class is one of the best way to take their time. If I start taking online class I will save my time on the other hand I develop my knowledge. Fixing The way of i'mÂ studying before. Most students are hated studying at home. They don't want to studying at home. Instead of studying they prefer to play games. But, If they have online class they starting study and they will fix their problem. That is better way to improve skills. Students become work hard and study hard. They will get good job. 
6320	This provide that, Being though full. Smart. genius. work hard and believe in your self. They starting believe in their self. That is make students proud. TheyÂ start thinking to do more. If you study a lot on online class you will do a lot. That is the way of improve knowledge. Also you could do any test. you won't afraid any tests. To change the way to you study. Online class helps you study more and also, help to havingÂ experience. 
6321	 Obviously, Online class can provide your problems 
6322	that is a slight way of how a real conversation would go if you really did need a opinion like that. Just be mindful that some people may say very ignorant things that have nothing to do with anything that you asked them about.   Â  Â  
6323	the most thing to have fun with the family and something they can do like homework during at home or study for the test that is one thing that they can benefit for the student. 
6324	the next they can't benefit attend at home because they must has to go every day at school and if student don't go to school they will have bad grade on class and all classes attend is the most important in the school. 
6325	attend classes from home they can't benefit at school and they can't benefit for student because tha is one of the most important rule the all school has and they must has to go to school. 
6326	Finally student would benefit from being able to attend classes from home that they can benefit like doing working on internet and also they can' benefit for student because they must has to go every day at school 
6327	that is one of the rule of school studen must being on the school,and them if the student don't go to the school they will get travel for be missin the school and they will have bad grade 
6328	Everyone needs assistance every now and then. Like when you fall and someone helps you up, they are assisting you. One time I was on a board at my house and I fell off and broke my leg, but my friend was there and he carried me to the house. He assisted me by helping me to the house. 
6329	Kids with these issues tend to have an even harder time learning in the traditional classroom environment and would benefit largely being able to learn from home. 
6330	Would you like to seek multiple opinion from different people? 
6331	Some schools offer distance learning as a option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing.  My position on this issue, 
6332	Energy keep you awake. Being concentrate shows interest on what you doing and comprehension is how much you understand. If you're sleepy you cannot do any of that. However, I want to focus more in the comprehension part. Never ever compare a teacher vs a computer. 
6333	Have you ever been asked for advice? Or asked for advice from someone? Or even a group of people? Well, I have 
6334	"but the question is ""do you have the money to pay collage?"".Â  "
6335	Not alot of people will have good advice for what you're looking for 
6336	In many states home education goes on as an alternative to public and private schools. 
6337	Being kicked out of school can be good or bad. 
6338	different beliefs or prejudice, 
6339	different experience 
6340	Imagine this, you find out your mail was robbed. You know that the mail always comes at 2:30 and you saw when the mail man came and dropped it in front of your house. Then you saw two teens walking in front of your house. You might quickly regconise them and quickly call the cops but they wont get arrested on the spot. The police will have to have witnesses,and the teens  Point of View of the story  I always ask my friends what they think about something before making my final answer.  
6341	Thats why i think asking for other people opinions matter. 
6342	The students can have time to do his homework. The students can use the online to do the homework and the his works. The video conferencing they can helping the students to do the worth and the homework. The students con have a video conferencing to tookÂ to the teaches when the students have a questions. 
6343	they can call to the teaches to helping when theÂ student have a question. the most of theÂ student can have class in hoe is morale to do writing. the stundents can have time to go to the job. some schools do have after distance learning as on option for students to attend class from home by way of online or videos conferencing 
6344	Lots of eventers createed a lot things based on there opinion on something. Thomas Edison belived that he could make a ball of light and what did he do he mad the light bulb and every single house in the world that uses electricity uses the light bulb,I even got one at my house. Bengimin Franklin wanted to find out what lightning was so he went outside with a kite and a and a key and he captured and it couldv'e killed him. But it did not instead of dieing he was the creater of elctrictity. How do you think you got to work today? Even public speakers have there own opinions how do you think African American children and American children are in the same school,becasue Martin Luther King Jr belived or felt as if that the shouldn't be segregated any longer. The thing is about that is that is was his opion and helt to need he needed to say what he thought to everybody now lookat the world. 
6345	So if your going to tell a teacher, say it anonymously so no one knows who said what. You also don't have to worry about getting bullied when you keep it to yourself. But sometimes, people can't do that 
6346	"After you ask the people you wanted to ask for advice, your going to have to make a decision. Before you make a decision, you are going to have to think of the consequences. Consequences are the outcomes of your choices that you decided to make. There can be good consequences and then there can be bad ones. The bad consequences depend on the situation that you are going to be in or is already there. You have to think,"" If I do that what is going to happen. Is it positive or is it going to be negative."" Normally, people always go for the peaceful choice so their can be less problems. People also make choices everyday on what to eat, wear, and when they should do their papers. "
6347	some people need help on choosing what car they hod get, 
6348	like talk to other people on what places to go on vacation, 
6349	you can ask people about jobs 
6350	Secant of all, some young adults need help on what to get like a car, or a truck. Other people need a opinion on if he or she hod get a house, or a apartment. But it is good to ask more then one person for a advise. 
6351	we have other reason the schools have this oportunities 
6352	because some students they learning more the others, is like the leavel is hight then te school is ease then they chose take classes oline and this students is benefit they can work and they can hepl your family . 
6353	but when you in the group your work is more ease for you because you have other peoples and thye help you in thing a goods ideas and they can make a good work if you work only you need more time for doing you work and some times we can chese a good things and some times we need others opinions the other peoples. 
6354	because some people not have a the same beneficts and this people need other thins like others helps and i thing school need other things not onle classes online or classes in the home because they dont know how is the life te other peoples ans when school have a this thins like classes oline and classes in te home they need put estrited rulers for students they make a shure when students take a classes and they need have a god teachers and good ideas for students take a classes and not have preblems when they need graduate, because sometimes students have a problemes for graduate and that not is good. 
6355	new ideas, 
6356	different mindset 
6357	you can help others. 
6358	I think it's better to combine both ways. 
6359	But in my opinion. Attending clases online or directly at school don't matter. What matters is that the students find their best ways to learn and relieve stress.Â    Â  Â  Â Â  
6360	that I made a great decision In my life. 
6361	The last one is that I made a good decision. 
6362	Did you know that asking multiple people for advice will help you make a decision faster? 
6363	When people ask for advice they sometimes talk to more than one person 
6364	My seconds reasons:student who are smart should do there classes online at home.  
6365	Student who pass the SOL and the class they should get out early from school because people who have a job they should get out early from school. Student should have a high GPA so they can find a collage they want to be they have to think what they want to be when they finish high and collage so they can have there own business personÂ and make money. People who is smart should not go to school because they already pass every they did. 
6366	my third reasons:They should makeÂ classes work online onlyÂ for the kids.  
6367	Because it will be easy for them to do they classes work online. They should make classes online onlyÂ for kid it will easy fro them do it it at home batter then school but some parents they want there kid to go to school and do the work at school. If they school do classes online for kid it will be easy for teacher and for the kid. 
6368	My finial reason:For school offer classes online at home.  I think all high school student should have classes online at home because it will be easy for student and for the teacher. 
6369	If student have classes work online at home they can copy from his friends that why is not good to have classes online. Middle school should have a classes work online at home. 
6370	summer:  Collage should have online classes becuase it will easy for them do complete the classes online at home they will have time to do it and get a batter garde so you can complete the classes and take a new classes when you get A or B. 
6371	People ask for advise all the time, but have you ever thought about getting a second opinion? 
6372	Some students stay home and take their classes online so they learn better and no socail life helps with you getting your work done but that not always the case of this situition . 
6373	Benfit of kids taking they class online or video conferncing dont mean they gone always wanna wake up to do it or they gone wait last min to go the classes on online 
6374	When people need advice they ask people you have to see what their opinion is and then you think of what it is,opinions don't matter all it matters is what you think it don't ever let someone opinion change your whole mindset because it could get you in trouble ,so make sure your are getting the right advice don't do something dangerous and think about the right thing to do maybe you will be suprised with a gift or something special 
6375	when you get good advice just take it 
6376	don't listen to everyone you see because it might end up backfiring on you in the long run.  
6377	because i could say that lil wayne is trash in my opinion but others will disagree but if it your opinion keep it because it is people who get mad over opinions for no reason and it makes no,don't ever change your perspective of something no matter what they it is your emotions to like and don't like don't anyone tell you otherwise you could do the wrong i use to think wrestling was real until i realized that it was scripted (fake) but even if people told me it was fake i did not care i have been watching wrestling for years and in my opinion i love wrestling becausse i see guys wrisking their live for your entertainment ,i also watch movies,tv ,sports,anime,cartoons ,and etc and i like them all. When your taking advice or opinions make sure you know what they are saying to you so you won't be confused when your thinking about it ,when i get advice i use it to help me against problems so it won't escalate further because you never know what people are thinking that is why keep my distance i don't have time for that it is pointless it's arguing with a 3rd grader all they do is talk and i also learned that when it comes to my mom everyone will talk about her even though i really don't like it i have to deal with it which i have a counselor to help me control my anger before i lose it and explode because it is just some stuff in life that makes you hurt people because you have no other choice but there is always a choice everyone in the world has chocies that could either hurt you or heal you which is why if im about to do something crazy i go calm down so i won't end up the wrong thing that could cost me in the long run so i always take advice from my older sibilngs and opinions to me are just your feelings for sommethinng you love or hate that is something you keep with you. In my image opinions and advice are way different advice is for lessons and thinking while opinions is just your aspect of a person,place,and a thing because taking advice may help anyone who is not in the right mindset and it maybe will help you think otherwise about your all i care about is succeding in life that is my goal my name Generic_Name and i approve this prompt. 
6378	Although schools said students should not attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing because students are not learning enough, actually students should attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing because students have more time to sleep and the opportunity of more healthy food. 
6379	Classes online is not difficult for the students because in the computer we have modules and information and others things can help you, and is more easy in video conferencing because we have always somebody who can help, we can talk with a teacher or somebody, so is a good idea and new experience. 
6380	Way diesÂ it help to ask for multiple opinions it will let you see what they would do, 
6381	They shed have your best intros in mind, 
6382	You will get multiple way to do what you need to do. 
6383	They shed have your best intros in mind. 
6384	For exampleÂ IÂ was layering to throwÂ a cove ball in baseball.  I had two people helping me one of them had one way to throw it and the underÂ one had a defeat way.  I lest to both of them and I had to throw the first way that the first person told me.  You would see what they would do.  everyone has their own ape anÂ just like you you mint have a deft ape anÂ then your friend that is human.  So asking multiple people is not bad.  It will help you if length so dont let anyone tell you that getting multiple opinions. 
6385	In closer I thing that asking for multiple opinions is good become. You would see what they would do, if they are all good pople they will have your best in mind,and You will get multiple ways to do what you need to do 
6386	Students will be able to take online courses from their computers. 
6387	Sometimes having to make a decision is pretty hard thats why we ask for advice from some people. 
6388	When getting advice from multiple people its important to keep in mind when decision making because it can influence the decision you want to make. 
6389	When seeking for multiple opinions we always keep in mind what would be beneficial from making a certain choice. 
6390	critisim constructive or not 
6391	different knowledge 
6392	different perspectives 
6393	I think some students with benefit from distance learning and some wont.  
6394	Like if someone has 5 candidacies and they ask each person separatelyÂ a majority of the candidates will have different answers. So, if someone has both of the same answers then the person who is asking will probably lean more toÂ the similar answers. Just because the people go towards that answer doesn't mean that it is logical. 
6395	As long as you sign up with the school your attending, complete the course and earn the credit; they're able to graduate. 
6396	Your arguing with a sibling about something and both of you think you right. Your sibling goes to your parents about the situation. Both of you tell your side of the argument. Your sibling is right,but you wasnt completely wrong either. 
6397	Some students just prefer someone to teach them for they can help with what they are doing 
6398	if your close friend is in a different mind set as you and he/she is confused with what is going on or dont understand yall can help each other to understand and get to know whats going on in the situation and how to get a good answer and result.   Â  Â Â    Â  Â  Â  Â Â    Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  
6399	"by now some people have figured out that god laughs at us when we try something thats too easy and says, ""Hahaha you really thought you could do that, thats to easy your gonna have to do more if you want to do that!"" "
6400	just don't ask old people or they will give you a story and it will be long and boring. 
6401	choices 
6402	point of view of 
6403	the point of view.  
6404	opinions, 
6405	choices, 
6406	"lets say someone says ""you should go rock wall climbing"". Then another person says ""you should go swim with sharks"". You start asking and you go swim with sharks and then you climbed a rock wall. "
6407	We all ask for opinions right? and its normal that we do because it could help us during life. Not everybody gets that chance like we do because some people been doing by their own and thats totally fine you could also do that but 
6408	So people think others ask more than one person 
6409	I'm not saying all students can't attend online classes at home 
6410	but most cannot. 
6411	They would not be able to ask questions and get the answer they would need. They would not receive as much attention as they need. 
6412	yes becuase students would have more time to there work 
6413	and is give more time the techer plan out the lesson but thye got give a time limeit to finsh the work cuz then students can get done the work and it would be hlepful to some students cuz some learn better by them self and they wouldnt feel rushed by the teacher to finsh the work before class ends but some other students learn better when ther is a teacher right there teaching face to face some students learn diifernt then others and there would be problems with students like getting trouble and it will teach students responepillity and it would show if they are willing t the work or if they care or dont care cuz now a days students dont really care about school they just come cuz they have to cuz if they didnt need to come they wouldnt come they just think that school a waste of time for them but they dont know how much they need school and how much school os gooing help them in the futer but it will give students more time to sit dont and work maybe they like it more then coming to schoolÂ  
6414	"Different people have different answers depending on what they mean. one example would be ifÂ you asked for a science question, the easiest answerÂ would be... the perpendicularity of the potosytithsisÂ crosses the bisector witch then the kinetic energy will bounce off the radios and hit the diameter witch then will colaps on the pythagerm therom,So now the geneticÂ energy will explode like if it was uranium 232 witch then the servers will connect and create millions of nitros and million of galaxies will explode, all of these thing combinedÂ will make the Mississippi river,BUT I'M NOT DONE YET, after that is done the microwaves fusses and make the chemical reaction witch is using thermal energy ,so then the protons,electrons,neutrons,and the nukul s combines witch then you use length times wightÂ and also height. So that brings us back to the question,""when people ask for advice they sometimes talk to more then one person."" So you see that the potato has nine lives and the cat has 1 what is the difference between the two. that one cannot die and the other one can "
6415	"You should always remember that perpendicularity of the potosytithsisÂ crosses the bisector witch then the kinetic energy will bounce off the radios and hit the diameter witch then will colaps on the pythagerm therom,So now the geneticÂ energy will explode like if it was uranium 232 witch then the servers will connect and create millions of nitros and million of galaxies will explode, and after that is done the microwaves fusses and make the chemical reaction witch is using thermal energy ,so then the protons,electrons,neutrons,and the nukul s combines witch then you use length times wightÂ and also height. but i am not done yet ,so you see that 111=34=345 that is a very important number . as you can see that theses numbers connect the servers between the gaps of the potosytithsis, so then if you sad Creeper awwwww man, so we back in the mine got our pickaxes swing them side to side, side side to side , just task the gruling one hope to find some diamonds to night , night night night diamonds to night, because tonight the creepers are going to blow up our stuff tonight...[music stops] ""wait a minute..... this is not time for mine craftÂ songs"" now back were i was talking about"", every day people die for a unknown reason, about 10 billion die a second because of it. some say the reason was because of potatoes and the only solution is to stop the potato and the only was to stop the potato is to go the the potato tree where the magic potato will be there and the only way to stop the potatoes is to eat the magic potato the heroes will face 0 challenges for 2+2 is 4 - 1 thats 3 quick maths. "
6416	another thing we all learned from reading this is that you can't trust people on this earth, and how you can't trust humanity, and we all learned that every war was a mistake , and we all learned that the government just wants peoples money.1919, almost to the end,1894, close to the beginning of the mad world and this was another reason people ask for advice, 
6417	Always remember that the perpendicularity of the potosytithsisÂ crosses the bisector witch then the kinetic energy will bounce off the radios and hit the diameter witch then will colaps on the pythagerm therom,So now the geneticÂ energy will explode like if it was uranium 232 witch then the servers will connect and create millions of nitros and million of galaxies will explode, all of these thing combinedÂ will make the Mississippi river,BUT I'M NOT DONE YET, after that is done the microwaves fusses and make the chemical reaction witch is using thermal energy ,so then the protons,electrons,neutrons,and the nukul s combines witch then you use length times wightÂ and also height so then the electrons can symthisissize the H2O so then it connects the pontentchal energy and kinetic energy to fuse ,and to cause a rerefration to cause a refraction to case a reflection.

6418	Some people might say there are no benefits from distance learning, 
6419	Some might say that distance learning does not help students who are unable to go to school, 
6420	So when you ask me, what my stance on working at home rather than at school. I would simply answer with, I don't know 
6421	Learn something from more then one person because they help you dont get in trouble and be a good student or son if you learn from someone us. 
6422	Learning advice from school is good because everyone learns and get good grades 
6423	When people ask for advice is because they want to know what things are better like to buy. 
6424	When we are in math class the students gave us advice same with the teacher. Sometimes students gave us advice how to do the work of the problem more than one student gave us advice. When teacher shows advice of our class work how to do it and know when test are coming for be ready. Also the bus driver gave us advice how to act inside the bus. If the bus driver does not gave advice everyone in the bus will act crazy and maybe a accident. Thats why everyone should said a advice for we could be safe and be good. 
6425	Distractions are never a good thing, so why work with them? Teachers in school create rules for students to be sucessful without the distraction of a cell phone, food being handed out in class, and classmates misbehaving. 
6426	Cell phones take up most of a students day and it does not benefit them at all. 
6427	There is a lot of reasons why online classes are not good and, a lot of reasons why it might be helpful to other students and not all. 
6428	I think you should ask 3-5 people there opinion on a problem.Â  
6429	Reasons why you should ask for advice are so you dont make anyone mad, Get the job thats good and fits you well and so it dousnt knock you down and ruin your life. You don't want to mess up you future so ask for help and choose wisely. Never do something so suddenly without thinking because you might hurt yourself physically or mentally or other always think beofre acting. 
6430	They might hate what the idea was and since they were not asked or told about it they feel betrayed. But if you asked for advice or help they might help you make a better decision for yourself. Everyone wants to make the right decision but if you need a little help sometimes ask someone who already does the thing you want to do, or ask your family what would be best for yourself. If you dont ask you could make the wrong decision and and end up needing your family for help later and living with your parents. So you never want it to fail that bad so if your hesitating to do something ask someone should i do this and why? Always ask people for advice and help because if you dont it could ruin your life. 
6431	low experience 
6432	How an online class works is that it's held at a certain time every week. During this hour long session the teacher turns on her video cam and goes through a power pointÂ teaching us what we need to know for the week. 
6433	an individual choice you can make out of those opinions. 
6434	Should students gonna be benefit from being able to attend classes from home? 
6435	opinions. 
6436	the students that are take classes at home can get time for be preparate 
6437	for example .the online classes are a easy way to learning at home. 
6438	Online classes are a good methods for the furure students ,also the teachers can benefit about because they can spend time out of schools 
6439	The distances methods are a good way to learn ,also is a goog advancen where teh students get benefit to learning and inprobe their studys spend time in online classes is the better and easy way to preparate students for the future. 
6440	Firstly, bot all student woud be able to take online classes i don't see nothing from i as a student would not like it, i woulike to say by taking an online classess is is not worth it. 
6441	My Second reason is about me whiles i was growing up. 
6442	Since the i was born coming up, my mom said to me the day you start going to school Henry make it your own. Because there was no tecnology, no internet to used for and online classes. Because when ever mom give 1 dollar to go to school i will walk from my house to school which is 4 miles away from my home.Â  
6443	Hawever, some student have a lot problemn from the school, beacuse they don't go to the school and have a lot marked aucent that is a big problem if u don't come to the school every day,When you are sick you can have an excuse, you can bring a card singnature for yours parents or grande. A example I need to come every day to the school, beacuse my dream is graduate of High school. Thas why i need to come every day at the school. Some students doesn't like come to the school, cause they are lazy they don't need what I need. My dreas is graduate of High school after High school, I need find a jod, and support my family and also i want go to college. Attend for me mean have education. For example help people who don't have money to buy food and who don't have a house we can help then, how to find a house where they can live; The teacher need soppurt all the students she/He have. We need paid attention all the time, because that is very importan for you future .  
6444	That is so important for me and my parents and for others stuadents and parents. You can m,ake a video online for attend class, because you need pass all the Esol well you need, for graduate. UIm so aprobe of my brother , because he help me a lot he's really lovely with me,and he have all the information from the school of me.Â Attend when you don't come at the school you aucent and if you have a lot aucent, they can kick you out, because you need to come and paid attention all the teacher said. i need paid attention all to my teachers, because they are important in the school, they teach you a lot for yours future and when you have yours own childrens you need to talk and help to your chils. education is all for your life. But, you need go every day the school and don't be aucent pass all the Esol well, Youe need work a lot and hard, if you want a good grade or if you want credits. Credits are important for graduate. Hawever, if you have all the credits, puedes recibir el mejor diploma. Is very important and not all the student have the best diploma, that why you need to work hard and don't skeep any day of the school. You need go every day and don't be late evry day .Â Â Â  
6445	When people ask for advice, they sometimes talk to more than one person. 
6446	Money. Technology. Opportunity 
6447	students to attend classes from home by way ofÂ online more benefit and against for students. 
6448	In today's world , most of students can accesses education at home according to  The Washington post 
6449	Students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home. This shows that how students should learn more stuff by way of online. 
6450	Obviously, learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online more interesting thing. 
6451	In conclusion, students to attend classes from home of online more benefit and against for students. 
6452	you get to hear which piece of advice is most said  Supporting detail number 2: you get to choose from all the opinions  Restate thesis: There are multiple opinions from hearing multiple peoples advice because you get to to hear which piece of advice is most said and you get to choose from all the opinions. 
6453	you get ideas from other people  Supporting detail number 2: you get multiple opinions  Restate thesis: hearing multiple ideas gives you many options of advice you can take from ideas and multiple opinions. 
6454	Why do people ask multiple other people for advice 
6455	Its not because I am attending a public high school. 
6456	Why is it when someone asks you for advice there the one's talking most of the time? 
6457	Here are 2 of the reasons I think that the person who asks for advice talks more than the one who is giving the advice. 
6458	when are you take the video online you dont have a teacher for tell you what do youÂ needÂ do in the class 
6459	Conclusion: you dont are prepared for take the class online worst is a video coferencing because you dont have teacher, organized ,and partners 
6460	someone can use everything that many people said and use it to help them. Somebody might ask for an opinion of how they look, or what someone thinks of something.  The person that wants an opinion might want to ask many people because they want to know what is better to do, use, or wear. People always ask for an opinion. Some people do things based on someones' advice because they think it will be better or make the other person happy 
6461	In conclusion asking for an opinion can be beneficial to someone.Â
