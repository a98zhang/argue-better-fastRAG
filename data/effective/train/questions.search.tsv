They are saying that the Electoral Colledges votes matter the most those are the only once we are worrying about. But thats not true our opion does matter, we are what make up this amazing cuntry not just the Electoral Colledge.

11	"""While looking in the mirror "" By looking in the mirror can't really explain or say what's are emotion are becuase mirror don't speak and it doens't tell your emotions. People use mirro just becuase they want to see what's on their face or if it's dirty or what, how they look before they go somewhere. Mirror just copying what were doing in front of the mirror like if you start talking ofcorse your twin face in the mirror also gonna start talking too,becuase mirror is just a piece of a glass that can't describe what's people's emotion. Mirror can copy what were doing but can't say what are emotion or feeling. "
12	"The electoral college is a process, not a place. The electoral college process consists of the selection of the electors. The electoral college consists of 538 electors. In the 23 Amendment of the constitution, the district of columbia is allocated 3 electors and treated  like a state for purposes of the electoral college. For this reason, in the following discussion, the word ""state"" also refers to the district of columbia. Next, each canidate running for president in your state has his or her own group of electors.  The electors are generally chosen by the candidate's political party,but state laws vary on how the electors are selected and what their responsibilities are.  The president election is held every four years on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. Also, most states have a ""winner-take-all"" system that awards all electors to the winning presidential canidate . However, Maine and Nebraska each have a variation of ""proportion representation"".  Abolishing the electoral college! But don't worry they're not alone; according to a Gallup poll in 2000, taken shortly after Al Gore.  Thanks to the quirks of the electoral college, which won the popular vote but lost the presidency, over 60 percent of voterswould prefer a direct election to the kind we have now.  Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president.  You might not know this so if you dont here is something very interesting for you to know. Who are the electors? Well they can be snoyone not holding public office. Here's something eles you might know, Who picks the electors in the first place? well here's the answer it depends on the state. The single best argument against the electoral college is what we might call the disaster factor.  The American people should consider themselces lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century; the system allows for must more. consider that state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors, and thats those electors could always defy the will of the people. Black in 1960.  Perhaps most worrying is the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote. In that case, the election would be thrown to the hose of representatives, where state deegations vote on the president. "
13	but I do know that it was not made by aliens. 
14	and if they want to decide if they want to have their cell phones on in class is not going to be better for the teachers because they cant help the students learn and what is going on in life and what do they have to do as their assignment. they want to be texting in class and be distracted. 
15	What i can also personally add to this parrgraph is things are way more depenable and understanding and way more better and trustfull and when many people join their heads together. 
16	There's five reason to where the Electoral College should be retraining. 
17	The chose on have online course can go both way ,it depend on the on problem if most student and teacher complain about wake up to early and not having enough time to get every ready. In my opinion it depend on the situation the school is having ,if it the only way to have to have student to do their work and get everything done then go for it. There is no good or bad option for this. It's all on the situation on hand. Both thing have there goods and there bad ,but it is up for these school departments to know if it will help the student or make it worse than it was already. 
18	So in the storu it talks about going to diffrenet places in our solar system so in the story it talks about how some plants can actually hold humans in it cuase it has the same things this planet has but not all of them. So they where talking about a planet in particular venus a planet right next to us we can have a spaceship go there. they talk about some of venus things like how hot it is the planet reaches 800 degrees. 
19	"technoloy floods our brain, meaning there is so many inventions it just brainwashes us. We can use photo I.D. now for getting on to our phone. There are mixed emotions when we do show our personality, the techonolgy recognizes it. So we can change everything so someone says, ""the facial expressions for each emotion are universal,"" observes Dr. Huang. The mona lisa drawing is suppose to bring a smile to everyones face.  So people are still wandering what the mona lisa represents, the mona lisa represents art and beauty. There is a song called mona lisa, and its kinda a love song, saying your my mona lisa baby. So i think the whole idea of this song is to show that the mona lisa is a thing of beauty it represnts more than just beauty.  What else does it represent, well does your expression in the mirror suggest an emotion? Do you feel mad or sad. if you felt sad and you were crying and you went to the mirror and looked in the mirror, what would you see in yourself because down deep inside if thing yuo incredibly hurt. Can your lab partner recgonize which emotion you are doing? yes there is a doctor for that. there are so many emotions you dint even know throughout the day. "
20	Let me tell you the things that would change of limiting car usage. 
21	Because whats the point of all of our parents and alot of other adults of voting if we can't even get what we want but no it's all up to the electors and congress, ect. like for real what is the point in voting if it isn't a fair shot. 
22	i agree 
23	The consequences should be very big for being on a cell phone or let alone bringing a cell phone to school. Students should at least have a detention or even an in school suspension. Students need to know their boundaries and what happens when they cross them. Discipline is a great way to turn students off their cell phones 
24	like the one we have today. 
25	They are trying to said that they want to invent a computer that knows when are you happy and when you are sad or angry and other caind of emottions.  each they there are trying to have new tecnology and new stuff they have to see whats goin on in that they have to do what they have to do.  Other peopl;e dont like to see other people expressions because they get enoy from seeintg them.  They are seeing video games and trying to see what can they do to modofy them . 
26	Some people thinks its funny to watch other contenets to bein war. 
27	I disagree.  
28	This painting is was made a long time ago. Many people found this painting weird because, back then there wasn't a lot of people happy, also poor. So when you see this picture this girl is happy and looks like she has nice cloths on. People took this picutre into inspiration. And brought a lot to the picture. 
29	My therd reasion is if you make it be useable on animals then we can uncover a lot of mysteryes 
30	to help with all the dier need that the world has to offer for the Electoral College just dont get rid of it for no reason you need to have a really great suggestion to remove it out of the system. 
31	The electoral college requires a presidential candidate to be choosen. 
32	Finally I think If we could choose the president it would be better becuse the people would get what they want 
33	I don't believe a technology can identify human emotions 
34	when they lying too, becuase some students dont like to show or describe how they feel. not just on students we should use it on we should use it on friends and family too. we need to know how to help people if they upstet to cheer them up, or if there happy we need to know what made them happy. 
35	but that is an opion.  Their are meany rational reasons about why the Electoral College is benificaial rather then destructive. 
36	if the NASA cameras did not see any people/aliens. On that fact if NASA did see any aliens on Mars they would have kept it top secret and wold have not showed the images to the world 
37	Therefore, I agree with what the passage is saying because it says ''The Electoral College consists of 538 electors. A majority of 270 electors votes is required to elect the President. Your state's entitles allotment of electors equals the nu,ber of memebers in its Congressional delegation: one for each member in the House of Representatives plus two for your Senators.... 
38	According to paragraph three of source one , the Electoral College consist of five hundred and thirty-eight electors . A canidate has to earn two hundred and seventy of those votes . 
39	Venus is our sister planet. Some call us twins because of the sizes we both have. But, Venus is the closest to the sun like Mercury is the first panet next to the sun. So Venus is the warmer part of our sisterhood, and Earth are the cold part of our sisterhood. It's sort of like Venus is Anna because of her warm personality. And earth is like Elsa, because of her frozen powers, so she is extremely cold when it comes down to things. Earth at the moment is like Elsa because of its winter landish time of the year. 
40	"""Evening Star"" this article state in, venus is one of the brightest points of light in the night sky,making it simple for even an amateur stargazer to spot.  ""Twin"" this article state in, venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size, and occasionally the closest in distance too.  ""The venus blanked."" The article state in the venus atmospere have almost of 97 percent of carbon dioxide.  ""Venus surface."" the article state on the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greateer than what we experience on our own planet.  The article essay, thia articlo explain about ""The challenge of Exploring Venus""  venus is a planet nd look like a star because brightes points of light in the nigth sky, and tambien is a ""twin"" is the earth's twin, venus is it really closest at the eart and tambien look similar in the size and in the density, tambien look are similsr in the distance.         "
41	"In source 2: the indefensible electoral college: why even the besy-laid defenses of the system are wrong states ""because of the winner take all system in each state, candidates dont spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the 'swing' states."" "
42	This 'Face' isn't a landform, its a lifeform. 
43	"After you ask the people you wanted to ask for advice, your going to have to make a decision. Before you make a decision, you are going to have to think of the consequences. Consequences are the outcomes of your choices that you decided to make. There can be good consequences and then there can be bad ones. The bad consequences depend on the situation that you are going to be in or is already there. You have to think,"" If I do that what is going to happen. Is it positive or is it going to be negative."" Normally, people always go for the peaceful choice so their can be less problems. People also make choices everyday on what to eat, wear, and when they should do their papers. "
44	Getting more opinions can help you because it can get you more advice and by getting more advice helps the person asking know more. What does it help by asking more than one person it can get you get you more advice just in case you did not know. 
45	Venus is a very dangrus planet its ben proven, not one human has lasted more than a few hours floating above the fray,its been more than three decades since a space ship has tuched venus but 
46	I think it is a good thing then all you will have to do is say to your computers how do i feel today it will say to you 
47	If you don't want to make all the kids in the school do community service, then i think you should put up a sign up sheet for students who want to so they can sign up, and have a day or two every week were they leave school for a couple hours to go do some community service with some teachers that volunteers also.  
48	NASA is working on a lot of different approaches on how to last a while or have a good landing on Venus. 
49	I have done research 
50	I hear you are trying to make a decision on whether all students should be required to perform community service. 
51	Its like the man it the moon it is just a landscape it is nothing big at all. By saying that it is an alien people today would probally believe that it is true they would go crazy. 
52	No one should force you too do anything that is outside of your comfort zone except your parents, they can force you to do anything they need you too do. Other than your parents and family members,no one should even think about forcing you to do something because that is just a horrible thing to do. unless they have permission from your parents, I don't think that they should be able to tell you that you can or can't do extracurricular activities because that would'nt be fair to the people who actually enjoy them. As for the rest of us, we'll be fine her as long as we don't have to do any pointless extracurricular activities. So to answer the question, would you like to have to do an extracurricular, No! not at all, but some people might 
53	we should be able to pick and choose what's in our schools 
54	FACS can classify six basic emotions happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness just by seeing the the movements of your facial muscles. 
55	This way it will teach the students that they shouldn't litter and that it is bad, and damages a lot of our property and if they do it they will have to pay for what they have done and suffer a big punishment. For example if someone throws a drink bottle on the ground it is there responsibility and they should clean it up. 
56	If the principle were to make this rule then everyone wouldnt be as lazy. 
57	A magority of 270 elctors votes are reqiured. 3 Electors and treated like a state of purpose. Running for president has their own group  of elcetors. Help choose the states electors when you vote for canidate. Governer prepares a Certificate of Ascertanaiment. 
58	Everybody is different most people that read somebody's emotion is because there a love one or a every good friend and they can read your emotion. There is just other people that don't care. Most people should be able to see if your angry, sad or happy. Those emotions are easy to see, kids show it all the time even when there not feeling so good. 
59	You are helping them by choosing wich president will help them and thier family have a better life. The citizens know what they need, they know if Obama is going to help them or not. They know who to vote for because they are providing what they need to live good life. If more citizens vote ofr one president then another, gues what? You just helped more then half of the us a citizens because they knew wich president helped them more. The trouble is out here and you can only fix it with us.  
60	In 1976 Viking 1 took a photo of formations on mars. The picture looked like a face so the people of the world thought oh my god. Aliens invaded mars and they will invade us run 
61	I think there is some good things about the Electroal College but some things I do not agree 
62	There are advantages to this way of life 
63	but if this is not a face what is it? That's what your thiniking right. We had to find out 
64	The author has different details and has found them. 
65	because you are adding and subtracting only 538 people, but if you are counting from popular votes you would have to add up millions and billions of votes that would be miscounted. If it's miscounted the wrong person could be elected for president.            
66	As you can see cell phones are 
67	And yet, it is still how president after preseident is put into the Oval Office- sometimes wrongly as explained above. 
68	How would they survive and humans can not. In paragraph nine it discribes how hard it was to even get a picture of this face. If its very hard to get a good glimpse of this image. Its going to be struggle to live and be active on Mars as well. This has to be a natural landform that happens to looks like a face. If someone really did this, they would want credit and all the fame for all their hard work and i think we would have spotted them all ready. 
69	It might even make some people turn against their country, but that only goes for the people who are really into politics and voting and things of that nature. People say you can't complain if you don't vote, but if they take that perivlage away, I'm sure you'll be hearing even more complaining than if people have the right to vote, but even so, this up and coming generation isn't really into voting anyways, but it should be avalable regardless. 
70	Other teenagers might think that it is all fun and games 
71	This a one time offer. You don't know how long this opperation will be running. 
72	First off, Mona Lisa is mostly always happy and she wanted to come up with a way to see if a lot of school students are happy or just faking there happiniss and hiding there real emotions. 
73	Students should have the same rights as teachers or any adults. The constitution says that all people are created equal. That should give students the right to bring cell phones to school 
74	i mean yes theres alot of bandwagon fans and people who really have no idea of whats going on in their country 
75	It could be possible but we will have to wait to find out. 
76	In the begin in the story it talks about how she had 83 percent happy and 9 percent digusted smile and 6 percent fearful and 2 percent angry. And that her science teacher had graded her latest lab assignment. And that mona lisa at least according some new computer of showing her emotions. 
77	That cannot be true becasue if the aliens were hidden we would not have such a great picture of the faces. That completly shows that there is proof that this face is just a natural landform. 
78	"No ones life should have to be put on the line to explore a diffrent planet. I personally think its a great idea. As said in the passage ""Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation.""         "
79	You have the best food out there too 
80	If the eclectoral college leads to a tie our votes become the tie braker but that method has never been use so why are we even voting? 
81	America was made to give people freedom, so people being able to pick the pesident is a big part of our freedom, and taking that away leaves us with not as much say in big desions such as a presidental election. The people that would probably complain the most is older people because they are use to being able to vote, and taking that away would get them angry I'm sure, and the people complain louder than they do praise. 
82	why i think that we should keep it how it is because is concissed of it concissed of 538 electors and the majority of 270 elector votes is required to elect the president. your state is required to allotment of the electors to equal the number od members in its Congerssional delgation. Under the 23 Amendment the district of columbia is allocated 3 electors. each canidate running for state has the there own group of electors. Electors are genarall choosen by the politial party. you or who ever is voteing helps choose your states electors when you vote. but when you vote for your candidate you ae actually voting for you candidates electors. After the electon there is a Certificate of Ascertainment perpared by the governor listing all of the canidates who ran for President along with the hname sod their electors. 
83	if we go to the second planet from the sun the gravity would be more tense and would have different affects on humans. the gravity on venus would pull them down more than earth because it is closer to the sun by two planets away. but we also need to think about the air and the atmosphere because if we just go there then we might die. the air on venus is un supportive to humans and the water is not there or it might be a type of water that if you drink it it will kill you. the storms on venus are acid storms, the rain is acid. so i think the only reason why the author is saying that venus is a challenge is because not only the facts above. but also that the fact is that on the serface, temperetures average over 800 degrees fahrenheit. and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we humans experience on earth. so he also might be saying that it might be a challenge because if we take a rocket, it might be torn apart if we dont have the right mesurements. 
84	The NASA has only one particularly compeliing to study whats beyond what people dont see or dont know for hummans can travel to other plants 
85	People don't always think that creations like that can be made by a natural landform 
86	Another quote from paragraph one is ¨However, this nickname is misleding since Venus is actually a planet. In our solar system, Venus is the second planet from our sun¨. This quote means that even though Venus looks like a star because it extremely bright, and shows off an extreme amout of light it is a planet. Many people mistake Venus as a star but once they find out it is a planet they are amazed because of the brightness of it 
87	There are so many positive things on why to keep the electoral process and I also make room for the errors of it so dont think im on a one man train,because im not 
88	i would never go and get a computer to help me with my problems because they dont know everything plus why would you want it in the classroom anyway , someone can come steal it or anything you never now a days people is doing all types of stuff 
89	They try to find,(are  SUPPOSED  ) to find a non decided not on any side representative for that state. But that plan has failed. 
90	but when you in the group your work is more ease for you because you have other peoples and thye help you in thing a goods ideas and they can make a good work if you work only you need more time for doing you work and some times we can chese a good things and some times we need others opinions the other peoples. 
91	Can we calculate our emotions like math? Even we don't use this kind of techonology we can tell other people emotions by looking at their face. If we known all about what other people think about us, it didn't good for all of us.  
92	After this decision starts getting enforced, every student will be able to find something they like!  
93	The Electoral College is a process where selected elector come together and vote for President and Vice President. It consist of 538 electors and majority vote (270) is required to elect the presient 
94	Venus has the hottest surface tempature of any planet in our solar system, though Mercury is closer to our sun. Beyond high pressure and heat, Venusian geology and weather present additional impediments like erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning strikes to probes seeking land on it's surface. If our sister planet is so inhospitable, why are scientists even discussing further visits to its surface? Astronmers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system. Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life. Today, Venus still has some features that are analogous to those on Earth. The planet has a surface of a rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains and craters. 
95	If the advocates of this position is correct in arguing that the Electoral College method is not democratic in a modern sense . It is the electers who elect the president, not the people . It is entirely possible that the winner of the electoral vote will not win the national popular vote. yet this has happened very rarely when Gore had more popular votes then Bush . It can be argued that the Electoral college method of selecting the president may turn off selecting the president may turn off potential voters for a canadidate who has no hope of carrying their state . And not having everyone vote mite throw things off too. but of courseno voters  vote swings a national election, and in spite of that about one -half the eligible American population did vote in 2012 's election. 
96	It good to play do activiy but it a lot thing to do outside have fun or some we young sports is fun to but no one want to be and a hot gym half of the day out of energy when you get home you get home you going want to go to bed going to want to eat and sleep that it now activty a lot eat and sleep that it now activty a lot of work some don't like now who want sit after scool to do some work  
97	Most of the time electoral college makes mistakes on who they pick. 
98	"In the text it says that ""NASA possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientist to float above the fray."" It also says that "" not a single spaceship has toched down on venus in more then three decases. No spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours and no one had ever been there."" You could be the first one to land on Venus. This proves that since it is a dangers planet it would still be worthy seeing it. Now, lets talk about why it wouldn't be worthy seeing it. "
99	It's illegal to drive with a phone and its multiple why you can't drive without a phone 
100	I think we should explore venus because venus might have the material that earth has not 
101	So don't force us to do something we don't want to do, or buy something we don't want to buy, or force us to not buy something so we eat with dirty dishes.  
102	that why Venus is whorthy pursuit despite the dangers presents. 
103	When you are using your cell phone while driving, you're doing all three types which are manual, visual, and cognitive. 
104	you wont have to worry about the hassle of having to call parents to come pick up the phone. 
105	This policy may work so students can bring their grade up and stop failing their classes. One way they can bring up their up and be able to participate in sports is by turning in there homework and completing their work in class. 
106	If the congress or whoever was to abolish the electoral congress vote I think we would see numerous of changes in our past history and our future, 
107	I really believe this change in your school's regulation could help your students develop into a fully grade A campus and be even better than before. 
108	If they every change the system to popular votes for the president it would be a honest choice 
109	I have recently read an article by the name of ¨Driverless Cars Are Coming¨, and asked my opinion. 
110	"Venus's knickname is sometimes called the ""Evening Star"" mainly because Venus is simple to see from the distant but safe vantage point of Earth has proved a very challenging place to examine closely.  It is also called the ""Evening Star"" because Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size, and occasionally the closest in distance too. On Venus, the temperatures average over 800 degrees Farenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than on Earth. "
111	But I feel they should take it a little more exstreme for things like could also have audio and could really help with peoples lives. Not even the bad emotions if you are happy or exicted it can sense that and something good could happen.  
112	I hope you choose to become a seagoing cowboy and help out the people in need.             
113	*they only do it like that at some schools* 
114	luke bomberger wants to be a seagoing cowboy who rides the waves becuase he is used to riding the waves because he crossed the atlantic ocean 16 times and the pacific twice to help people affected by WW 2. he rode on a cattle boat to europe to be a sesgoing cowboy. his friend don reist is going and he knows that luke can surf. and don invited him and luke is working to jobs as a bank accountant and a grouchery store. so he has to decide wether he should go or he should stay at his zenith.  luke decides to go and it was 1945 in WW2 was all over europe many countries were left in ruins.  to help these countries all 44 nations joined together to form UNRRA hired seagoing cowboys such as luke luke and don signed up.  in august 1945 the two boys luke and don recived threir orders the report to new orleans. the ywo boys are doing this so they coud be a sea going cowboy.  the two boys arived august 14. the day the pacific war ended they got their seamans papers and boarded the ss charles w. rooster and they headed for greece.  the cattle boat trips were an unbeleiveable opportunity for a small town boy luke also toured china greece venice and a excavated castle. luke was at the atlantic ocean for two weeks and it took him a month t get to china. 
115	I don't think the landform is an ancient artifact or any alian artifact i just think its a normal landform that happens to look like a human or alian face. 
116	"There would be multiple guesses on how her face looks. In paragraph 6, the author says, ""The Mona Lisa demonstration is really intended to bring a smile to your face, while it shows just how much this computer can do."" Some people might say that she looks mostly happy, a bit disgusted, somewhat fearful, and a little angry. Or they might say all of them and more. We all have different minds, different thoughts, and a different sights at describing a picture. "
117	"For one, it is the second planet closes to the sun so it would be extremely hot. Next, the air pressure would be quite hard for humans to handle as well. In the passage it states, ""On the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet."" This clearly gives enough information to say that these conditions are more extreme than what any human can handle. "
118	On my opino i don't consiter them to change to poplaur voted becasue to me its nothing i agree to keeping the electoral college votes  
119	it cause many crisis to happened. 
120	And others may have their opinions on this but it's ok to have your own opinion also different opinions don't hurt nobody it's just that different people believe in different things.    
121	because i don't really care about any of this. But you wanted my opinion so i gave it to you. Also I say to stick with the electoral college is because i don't care enough to give a reason to change your voting to popular vote. I don't really knoe anything about the ellectoral college or populare vot, because you passage is to boring i couldn't get through half of it. 
122	To commence the third reasoning let another question be asked: First, say for example that you work a double-shift, full-time, day and night just to keep food on your childrens' and wifes' plate, clothes on their backs, and a roof over their heads. When the bills roll in, your paycheck isn't won't arrive for weeks and you still haven't enough to pay, so you may have to work overtime if possible or pick up another job. No one gets rich off the government clearly, and yet we work so hard to just make it. Now here's the question: Doesn't it all feel worth it when the paycheck come in? Okay now for the deeper question: What is the sense or feeling you specifically get when you see you happy families' faces? Now for the point: Our work pays off. We work for the government (at least most of us does) together, whether to put bread on the table or otherwise. Now wouldnt it give us that sense of freedom that us hard workers get to make great decisions like these? It would. 
123	peoples reactions emotional expressions are different and people are different some people can have bad emotional expressions and it could be harmful, and it could be painful for others. People can have really great emotional expressions, like being happy all the time. It says in paragraph 1 that Mona Lisa is 83 percent happy, 9 percent discusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry. People can be the complete oppisate of that and it couldn't be good on other people, But people can also be like Mono Lisa and it makes the inviornment a better place knowing people are happy and not sad, discusted and angry. 
124	socializing with their peers. 
125	Like if you wanted to know how your dog or cat felt about you all you had to do was turn on the FACS and see. We could also see if lions kill becaues there mean or becaues they dont know what eals to do. Many things could be uncover thnks to FACS. 
126	Some school offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way online or video conferencing because for some students that's the best way to take their classes but for other student is not the best way because some student have to work after school and they have other responsabilities to do 
127	But over time sand bulid over it gave what it look like in 1976. In the photograph you can see that it maybe face but you can see that it can be a hill. What are the black spot in the photograph that we see here. It could be that is that can be made on mars by wnich it from by.                                      
128	it restores some of the weight that large states loses 
129	Over all i think it a good thing. They learn how to do good in school and sports and to be responsible.

132	NASA would be making our living situations a lot easier to handle of Venus by creating all of this new technology today in this age/era 
133	First,Professor. Thomas Huang of the beckman Institute for advanced Science at the University of Illinois working with  Professor. Nicu Sebe of the University of Amsterdam. Dr. Huang and his colleague are developing better ways for humans and computers to communicate which the proces begin when a computer constructs a 3-D computer Model of the Human face that contains all 44 major muscles in the model that must move like Human. 
134	The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational it officail !!!. Also arguments against direct elections are apurious at best. Bob dole was right:abolish the electoral college.  
135	the canidate gains no electoral votes by increasing his plurailty. that is a desirable result because a candidate with only regional appeal will umlikely succed to be a president. 
136	 People in this world always going off on what people say or showing them computers dont always be right 
137	But one the other hand, there saying that they might change it to the election of the popular votes of the president of the United States. I think they should keep using the electoral college because it actually have better benefits or outcomes because you know who you voted for and from what they told you 
138	I think of people need make manny technology because actual computers can be trick 
139	As I read more not all the people were ok with the problem 
140	according to the gallup poll in 2000, 60 precent of voters would prefer a direct election the electoral college is losing the little defenders it has and due to the spurious arguments the electoral college should be abolished 
141	GM has developed drivers seats that vibrates when the vehicle is in danger of backing into an object traffic jam assissant the car handle driving functions at the speed limit of 25 mph but special touch sensrs make sure the drivers keep hold of the wheel. the combination of all this input is necessary for the driverless car to mimic the skill of a human at the wheel.  The car read the positive and negative polarity as messages in binary code. these smart road systems worked surprisingly well, but they required massive upgrades to existing roads, something that was too expensive to be practical. 
142	Yes that's right they do have to make it to the candidate first they just can't walk up there first you got to be president by the pesident frist if you not by him or here then you messe dup for goood 
143	The people who don't like the idea usually become pessimists who hate everything, 
144	There are many veiw points of the Electoral College, but most would decied that its unfair, outdated, and irrational. The best arguments in favor of it are mostly assertions whithout much basis in reality. 
145	Secondly, the average temperatures of Venus is over 800 degrees Fahrenheit. 
146	That is the reasoning behind the fact that I agree with both sides here 
147	To them the president isn't their president. The winner/ the president gets all the awards and receive the most infromation. 
148	Why are scientist wasting their time trying to explore it and how would we know what is actually in Venus if we haven't yet explored it. 
149	lets just say u live in texas and wanted to vote for for john kerry youd vote for a slate of 34 democratic electors pledged to kerry. On the off chance that those electors won the state wide election,they would go to congress and kerry would get 34 electoral votes. Who are the electors? They can be anyone not holding public office.

153	Basic precepts are being adopted around the world in attempts to make suburbs more compact and more accessible to public transportation, with less space for parking. In this new approach, stores are being placed a walk away, on a main street, rather than in malls along some distant highway. 
154	And mostly because if we were to change it then the most of the former US Presidents would'nt even be President because of there rivals 
155	you have more ideas 
156	It can be good for them because they might enjoy it

We can still get use out of it, so why not make it a thing?

In the passage i said that unrra hired ""Seagoing Cowboys'' to take care of horeses, young cows, and mules that were shiped overseas. and Luke and Don sighned up. I think luke sighned up because he was helping out on his aunt farm. So he knew alot about helping with animals. "

The process begins whe the computer constructs3-d computers model to the faces . she also was also 83 percent happy 9 percent disgusted 6 percent fealful 2 percent angry . she was peaceful young lady to be honest . But while it shows as much as this computer can . imagine whst a computer that knows when your happy or sad . By the way making a happy face experiments also make you feel slighty happy . According to the feedback theory of emotion, moving your facial muscles not onlt the expresses emotion, btu also mau even help produce them

168	in the article the the author said NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions o the surface of venus would allow scientitis to float above the fray. Imagine a blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the roiling venusian landscape. Ths quotes means thta venus is pursuit because is halping people wiht the electronic such as vehicule. 
169	Principal I will be part of this program and i will help those elementary school students. 
170	The reason is that the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College is because it eceeds the presidents votes. Most states have a winner take all method to figure out who represents your state. It would work but it would be very different then our old presidentual voting. 
171	the Robot can study the plant while the astromistes stay on earth and they can egt data about venus thanks to the Robot. The Author says that NASA is always inventing new ways to get information from space and plants without doing it in person. 
172	"Say if i were to buy a big pizza ,and it was cut into 4 big pices and 8 small. The 8 people ate there pizza but it didnt really matter but when the the other 4 people ate there pizza it did . ok say if i weree to have a even pizza  4/4  . one half where the people and the other half was the big people in charge so u can say....no matter what the people say its only going to have like 25/100 effect.  After reading a text its says ""when you vote for a presidential candidate you're actually vothing for a slate of electors' "
173	Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, the U.S Chamber of Commerce, and the AFL-CIO, in their time , agreed on? Abolishing the electoral college. Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for the slate of electors, who in turn elect the president.  Who picks the electors? It depends on the state. Sometimes state conventions, sometimes the state party's central comittee, sometimes the presidentail canidates themselves. Voters can't controls whom their electors vote for. Well not always .Voters sometimes get very confused about the votes in vote for the wrong canidate.  The best arguement against the electoral college is called Disater Factor. The Americans should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election in a century. Back in 1960, segregations in Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratics with new electors that would oppose John F. Kennedy.  The Electoral College is widely regarded as an anachronism, a non-democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be overruled by declaring the canidates who recieve the most votes. A dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is possible, it happened in 2000, but it's less likely than a dispute over popular vote.  The Electoral College requires a presidential Canidate to have trans-regional appeal. No other region ( South, Northwest, etc.) has enough electoral votes to elect a president. The winner takes all method of awarding electoral votes. The electoral College avoids the problems of elections in which no canidate recieves a majority of the votes cast. For an example, nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992 both had only a 43 percent plurality of the popular votes.           
174	Anybodyvoted on who you wanted to win it go can cheat the number of votes to change the president they are voting for. With the Electoral College you can't do that because,  once you voted who you want to win, it get sent out tothe electors. Who from that point on count how many voted for both of them and decide a winner. 
175	People can asume it is a human's face because it look likes it. Another thing is that there is human's face on it, can mean life on the planet, Mars. Also the rock or the artifact does have an Egyptian Pharoah, it could mean a human was at one point up there. It probably is possible to have civilization on Mars. 
176	I reconsider that are principal should let us eight graders bring are cell phones to school and allow us to use them at all time except during class. 
177	maby when i right this all down he will change his mind. i hope so. 
178	Under the 23rd Amendment of the Constitution, the district of Columbia is allocated 3 electors and treated like a state for purpose of the Electoral College. The electors are generally chosen by the candidates political party, but state laws vary on how the electors are selected and what their responsibilities are. The president only haves four years, it is held every four years on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. When you vote for your state they have a thing called winner-take-all system that awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate. However, Maine and Nebraska each have a variation of proportional representation. When the election is done they have a thing they do called Certificated of Ascertainment it lists all of the candidates who ran for president in your state along with the names of their respective electors. The Ascertainments are then sent to the Congress and then to the National Archives as part of the official records of the presidential election. 
179	it should be what the people feel most comfortable choosing 
180	In coclusion a computer are able to read your face. The computer are developing to a human understand themself. The first moment of your face can be good or bad. Well sametime are deficult ourself to able smeli or cry. To have affect is a great emotion to feel.      
181	"The founding fathers established it in the Constitution as acompromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by popular vote of quilified citizens. Your state's entitled allotment of electors equals the number of members in its Congressional delegation, one for each member in the House of Representatives plus  two for your Senators. The presidential election is held every four years on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. You help choose your state's electors when you vote for your candidate you are actually voting for your candidate's electors. The Certificate of Ascertainment also declares the winning presidential candidate in your state and shows which electors will represent your state at the meeting of the electors in December of the election year. Your state's Certificates of Ascertainments are sent to the Congress and the National Archives as part of the official records of the presidential election. At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winner-take-all system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states the know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on thje tight  races in the ""swing"" sates. During the 2000 camaign, seventeen states din't see the candidates at all, inckuding Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters inn 25 of the largest media markets didn't get to see a single campaign ad. If anyone has a good argument for putting the fate of the presidency in the hands of a few swing voters in Ohio, they have yet to make it. The electoral College requires a presindential candidates to have trans-regional appeal. No region (South, Northeast, etc.) has enough electoral votes to elect a president. So a solid regional favorite, such as Rommey was in the South, has no incentive to campaing heavily in those states, for he gains no electoral votes by increasing his plurality in states that he knows he will win. This is a desirable result because a candidate with only regional appeal is unlikely to be a succesful president. The residents of the other regions are likely to feel disenfranchised, to feel that their votes do not count, that the new president will have no regard for their interests, that he really isn't their president.

188	I think if you are failing a class you should focus on that grade and bringing it up and getting it to at least a C or B . I also think that kids that get in trouble shouldnt be allowed to because they didnt listen or did something they wasnt suppose to . Why give a kid this if they dont listen, they dont deserve to do something like this is they are being disrespectful or not listening. Students that do get good grades above a  D ad F and arent disrespectful should be able to do this if they wanted to.

190	Also, if the person does make a mistake they should be able to unelect them also cause people need what is best for are country. 
191	This shows that with the Electoral College, not every region is going to have electoral votes. Therefore, it would not be fair for those regions. Perhaps their votes would not count and basically the chosen president would not pay attention to them. 
192	"Electoral college have different ways and similar ways from changing to the election by the popular for the president of United States.For example states in source one ""The Electoral College consists of the 538 electors"".""A Majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the president.""

If you smile when a AD appears on your screen the computer will bring up another AD that is similar to the AD your looking at right now. But if you frown the next AD won't be the same. According to the facial feedback using your facial mucsles doesn't only express human emotion they also help produce them.

203	Because if we give this country over to the wrong president our country could fall and we could go under. One of the reasons that our country is still standing today is because we as a nation have pick a great president, without hessition. Back in the old days we didnt have a right to vote. We are blessed to be able to vote and a system like the electrol college today. If we lose the electrol college we lose hope and faith that our country we be still standing.

Some people dont pay attenion to the light on the street oor not in the right lane or turn when u suppose to turn that why we got lot driverless. Then alot people dont got they driver liences. Then people dont be in the lane right turn when u suppose to turn. some people can't park right because they dont pay attetions. that why we dont get caught. if you can't find what you want then u can get a navigating so you can be on your way to whatever your you go. that why driverless are coming.

216	the people vote for who they think is right for the job not just random people vote its unanimus decison to who wins. There is no reason to change the way things are going it has always been the same way the whole time ever since the united states was made in the first place. the people elect that is the advantage of a democracy which we have and in a democracy we vote by majority and thats how it most likley will stay in the united states no matter who the goverment is trying to vote in who they want but the united states is the power to vote in who goes into the office not the goverment so there is no chane of rigging all the votes so the unites states should not change to a popularity vote. power to the people is an old metaphor that indicates that we have the power to vote unlike in other countries where one man rules and the people have no power to vote for the best man to take over so in an electoral college we have all mighty power to make our own decisons to our future.

219	On May 24,2001 NASA sent Viking 1 in to outer space but what it found were still trying to figure out could there be life on Mars. The Viking sent back pictures of mars carved into it was a illusion of eyes nose and mouth so let me say again can there be life not just on earth but on Mars the question is still to be answerd. NASA says the have witness alot of things up that we dont know or could even imagin there could be life on every plant and if there is I know we all want to witness it one day. I know I am not the only one who would want to explore through out the box through out the earth but may I say the question is still out there for me for you for the future. So let that be known that you and me and what ever is out there are alike curious to seek and craving for advanture. You and me both will fly out of here hand by hand sister to brother to find whats on mars in the future qustion that is waiting to be answerd will be seen head smelled by the ones who are seeking that adventure to answer that qustion that we all what to know.

234	First, I would like to say that this is a really good topic the author brings forth to the table, 
235	In paragraph 4 the author tells us even though Venus's surface had conditions five times more extreme than what we see on Earth, long ago it was covered with large oceans, rocky sediment and craters. If Venus's conditions used to be so similar to Earth then could it possibly have supported life?

242	The Electoral College consists of 538 electors the majority only 270 votes is required for the final dessision. Each candidate running for the president has his or her own group of electors but the state law varys how many are selected. The presidential election is held every four yearson the tuesday after the first monday of november.  The states are called districts for example the word state also refers to the disrict of Columbia.

250	In conclusion people should be able to vote because then we'd be able to choose,so they could feel better about knowing who is passing laws and fixing their country. I may be under age but, I know if I were allowed to vote I'd want to vote for who runs my country and who helps run it.

254	I think i like the new technology that the person invented it can detect your emotins and feelings. And i doubt others can invent something like that 
255	Thats why all the states should have the same number of votes so the candidates would go there to try to win them over 
256	So i would pick policy 1 but if their using it in class then i would take policy 2 to teach them a lesson. I wouldn't care if they got mad serve them right. So remember always be fair especially if it's about phones everyone again I'm going to say everyone loves their phones. I would take in to consideration that you would select policy 1  
257	the challenge of exploring venus is one of the brightest points of light in the night sky, making it simple for even an amateur stargazer to spot. however, this nickname, is misleading since venus is actually a planet. In a solar system, venus is the second planet from our sun.  they call venus like the earth twin..  Venus is the closest to Earth in terms of density and size, and occasionally the closest in distance too. Earth, venus, and mars,our other planetary neighbor, orbit the sun at different speeds. While venus is simple to see from the distant but safe ventage pointof Earth, it has proved a very challenging place to examine more closely.  MY ESSAY.  The callenge of exploring venus is one of the biggest points of light in the night sky, these differences is speed mean that sometimes we are closer to mars and others times to venus. Because venus is sometimes right aroundthe corner in space terms humans have sent numerous spacecraft to land on this cloud draped world A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent dioxide blankets venus. Also notable, venus has the hottest surface temperature af any planet in our solar system, even though mercury is closer to our sun. astronomers are fascinated by venus because it may well once have been the most Earth like planet in our solar system. long ago, venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth. Today, venus still has some features that are analogous to those on Earth. The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such ass valleys, mountains, and craters. Imagine a blimp like behicle hovering 30 or so miles above the roiling venusian landscape. However, peering at venus from a ship orbiying or hovering safely far above the planet can provide only limited insight on ground conditions bacuse most forms of light cannot penetrate the dense atmosphere, rendiring standard forms of photography and videography ineffective.

The Electoral College has 538 electors, and majority of 270 electoral votes that is required to elect the presedent. Also, under the 23rd amendment of the constitution, the distric of columbia is allocated 3 electors and treated like a state for this reason, the word ""state"" also refers to district of columbia.  Plus, the presidential election is held every 4 years on a Tuesday after the first Monday of in November, and when you choose your states electors when you vote for president, you also are actually voting for your candidates electors. After the presidential election, the governor of your state prepares a listing of all the candidates who ran for President in your state along with the names of their respective electors called, ""Certificate of Ascertainment"".  Your state also sends a Certificates of ascertainment to the Congress and National Archives as part of the official records of thee presidential election. The Electoral College is also a widely regarded as an anachronoism, which is a non-democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be overruled by the candidates who recieved the most popular votes the winner.  This positions are correct in arguing that the Electroal College method is not democratic in modern sense, but it is the electors who elect the president, not the people. When people vote for the president they are actually voting for a state of electors. "
261	Furthermore, I believe we should keep the Electoral College for the president of the  United States because everything is label right. 
262	The American people thought they were lucky that 2000 fiaso was the biggest crisis in a century. The state legislatures are responsible for the picking electors. So maybe it was there fault, all I'll tell you this, they were not very lucky 
263	striving to meet the challenge presented by venus has value. because human curiosty will likely lead us into many equally intimidating enveavors. travelers on earth and beyond should not be limited by danger to explore venus more. venus should be expanded to help meet the edges of imagination and inovation.

That is better way to improve skills. Students become work hard and study hard. They will get good job. 
293	A dispute over the outcome of an electoral college vote is possible it happened in 2000 but its less likely than a dispute over the popular vote the reason is that the winning candidates share of the electoral college invairably exceeds his share of the popular vote in 2012's election for example Obama received 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to 51.3 percent of the popular votes cast for him and Romney .  . . . because almost all states award electoral votes on a winner take all basis even a very slight plurality in a state creates a landslide electoral vote victory in that state A tie in the nationwide electoral vote is possible because the total number of votes 538 is an even number but it is higly unlikely .....

I was happy to help all this people with there problems and when we got to go on a ship, we had the opportunity to take turns to watch over the animals at night to feed them and to make sure that nothing bad is happening like fighting our the bottom of the ship is being filled up with water.  So I signed up to watch them and so I got the job. I had to stay up super late to watch them and to I went to tell the captin that every thing was okay and so on my way I slipped on some water and I fell.  I had almost fell overboared but I didn't, thanks to a peice of meatel on the side of the boat and i was happy that I didnt die. I am thankful that I am still alive after breaking my ribs, and slidding down a latter. I soon recovered and was back to the job and so we took all the animals back to were they were.  So we made a game place were they were. We played a whole bunch of games and we did are ruiten, until we had another jod were we had to go get animals and watch over them. I am thankful to be able to do this job with people who care about me and support me well this job.  I wonder what are next job will be? Will I break another bone in my body? Can I survie another animal watch? Will I survie breaking another bone in my body? I don't know if i can survie another bone in my boby that can be broken?

296	Some people may think this new technology may be an awesome technology 
297	its a good process and it keeps us from having the problem of elections in which no candidates receives a majority of the votes cast. 
298	The things that are wrong with use the electoral college is that is the person gets their votes for thir state the might just win because, the more the people that live there more of the votes that they might get. 
299	When I get a good grade on my test and it is above 76 I am so happy that  I got a good grade on a test.  The reason I try to make good grades so I can go an stay at my friends house that is another reason I try to make good grades.  Another reason I like to keep my grades up is to be able to go to my moms house and that is one of my favorite places to go and stay. The other reasons I like to keep my grades up is so I don't get intruble so I do not have to do so much at the house and not being able to go fishing with my dad and that is another reason I like to get good grades. Another reason I like to get my grades up is so I can get to go to college.

302	Taking care of the animals was a great way for me to pass the time and helping my aunt Katie's farm made it alot easier. We arrived in Europe right after the pacific war. After Europe we packed our animals and headed up to Greece. I turned 18 before reaching greece so i was old enough to get drafted into the millitary, But they told me that i should just keep doing what im doing. The sea cowboys program is a great way to do millitary service to. .

304	To me I like it if you all would let it be the popular vote not by some college. 
305	then i feel lik that would seperte our world even moe ut this time is seperate from eachother from our closest friends and family because they would become our friends and they will become our family. i think if you want to end bulling and family problems etc. then is still not a good idea. like i said this still leads to segragation within ourseleves 
306	Most people that I have seen have got into something just to say that they are in not because they want to help they, just want to make their self look good and thats not OK. We can't always force someone to do something they dont want to do. 
307	I think that fellow citizens should have the advantages to car usage, because not everyone would feel comfortable ridding around in a bus or a train with lots of other people 
308	Driverless cars could be the next common technology among the human population like computers or phones.  From this, humanity will continue evolving and strive through conflicts similar to this subject.  However, another choice for us, individually is whether or not to accept change.

315	"Different people have different answers depending on what they mean. one example would be if you asked for a science question, the easiest answer would be... the perpendicularity of the potosytithsis crosses the bisector witch then the kinetic energy will bounce off the radios and hit the diameter witch then will colaps on the pythagerm therom,So now the genetic energy will explode like if it was uranium 232 witch then the servers will connect and create millions of nitros and million of galaxies will explode, all of these thing combined will make the Mississippi river,BUT I'M NOT DONE YET, after that is done the microwaves fusses and make the chemical reaction witch is using thermal energy ,so then the protons,electrons,neutrons,and the nukul s combines witch then you use length times wight and also height. So that brings us back to the question,""when people ask for advice they sometimes talk to more then one person."" So you see that the potato has nine lives and the cat has 1 what is the difference between the two. that one cannot die and the other one can "
316	A large state gets more attention from Presidential candidates in a campaign then a small state does. 
317	Most  counterclaims to my explanation is swing states 
318	It also helps the U.S by giving us a president.

325	The challenge of exploring venus is so one knows what is there. Pluse no one knows anything about it soneone would have to go. Then agian it would take forver to get there and there whould be no air maybe bc its in space. 
326	It keeps a steady stream when it comes time to vote because aslong as someone had 270 votes you know thats who will get picked. so why try changing that and have a whole new system put in and then not know what to do when it comes time to vote. And what if the new system dosent work, what if the new way of the voting process messes with the tallys and they come out wrong and no one will get picked, unlike the other way when u know everything will come out right and u know that we will have a president. I think its fair that they have it set at 270 for voting that way everyone havs a chance to vote instead of it being so low that only a few people get to vote before they shut it down because they have reached there number of tallys that they need.  So if they change the number of tallys that a president needs to become president that will be stupid and people will act out on it because they wont think its right, and because the people who didnt vote will not like the fact that they didnt get to put there vote f in before they stoped the voting and because they meet the number that they needed. Its a vote why do they need to title it as a the vote of a president or a popular vote of a president. Why not just vote for there just electors instead of saying vote for your candidate when really you are just voting for the electors. If you are voting for a certin thing there is no reason that u have to re-word it just to vote, if you are voting for something do it the right way instead of changing stuff and making it seem one way when really its the other way. Why should the electoral get just as much as the winning presindent? They are not doing as much as the president  and who is helping him out.. so they should not get the same reword.    
327	because this nation called the united sates is a democracy it is ruled for the people and by the people, when the government descides to go by the electoral college votes thats not ruling by the people because our nation dosent only consists of 538 electors we each have our own voices. we consists of 50 states all together if the government cant conduct electoral colleges in each state then it shouldnt be around in the first, we the people all have different opinions and outlooks on the universe it shouldnt only be counted for about 538 electors it unfair. and god knows where the electoral colleges are held and if they are being completely fair to everyone their are their all ethnicities from all over the nation, is it normal people that have nine to five jobs so they understand the struggles of an average person making 60,000 dollars a year, or are they picking business men and housewives that live in suburben neighborhoods. The nation have been completely blind sided by these things its just a scapegoat on picking the right president in their eyes and not in the peoples eyes. 
328	Luke wants to be a segoing cowboy because he likes to travel the seas and he also likes to be a cowboy. Another reason is because he wants to have fun as a cowboy and he really wants to go travel the seas. He wants to have fun because he never has fun at his house so that is why he wants to have some fun. His house is probably boring so that is also why he wants to go outside and have some fun at the program because he wants to get out of his house and have fun. He wants to go outside and do the program so he can be a cowboy and have fun. 
329	why make them do something that they wont even enjoy . I f the students don't enjoy what their doing then they wont understand the lesson that they are suppose to learn from the experience. 
330	Im all for the values of using this new emotion technology because you tell if people are faking a smile. You can tell because when you fake it you dont use the same muscles as when you really smile. When you fake smile the muscles you use are zygomatic major that make your mouth stretche sideways and the risori. But when you really smile you use the muscles called zygomatic major that begin at your cheek bones and life the corners of your mouth. The other muscle you use is called orbicularis oculi pars palpabraeus which makes crow's-feet around your eyes.

333	Driverless Cars can help people life more easier. Even if it can make the environment much better than before. Because now we have many cars drive on the street and they will have some bad thing to make the environment be bad.  A lot of people, they are smart. They think that in one day, we maybe making computer-diven cars. In fact, this is a smart way to make people llife easier. But this make more and more people to make smarter than this way to make people life easier.  Then they find a new way to developed driver's seats and they have lights. It can help them drive on the road at night and make people to be safety. 
334	parents wants there kids to go to school because they want there kids to have a better education then, them when there were kids and have a better life. so they don't have to do or find there way around things. parents want there kids to have a easier life. if students don't go to school this there is no reason to even have schools in the first place and just clean the community every day like its a job and don't get paid at all. its better to go to school because when you get to you are paid to go to school. not like its free and you want or you don't want. now this days students, will do anything to get out of class and out of school. students would fly school because they want to give away there one and only chance to find a good job. they would even try to get in trouble and get sent home and there parents don't care if they do that or even if the teacher calls them and say that ur kid however some may say that community is better because it keeps the community a better places to live but some teachers and parents disagree with this because teachers are like your second parents and they want u to go to school then do community service. 
335	Some people don't really agree with the electoral college process because they belive that if you vote you are voting for electors of your state that eventually vote for you at the end 
336	I think students can be benefit 
337	I'm not going to lie and say that none of the people who do get to vote are all voting because they know their stuff about the candidates, but some of us who do know about the candidates and how they are working should not lose the right to vote for who ever we would like. If we dont get to vote for who we like and believe is better then what type of country are we.  
338	Sometimes studying things can be real helpful because you can learn so many things about it. The article states, ¨These differences in the speed mean that sometimes we are closer to Mars and other times we are closer to  Venus.¨ 
339	Everything that is rong with the electoral collage 
340	The one thing I like about the voting system is that people can pick who would be the best candidate for our nation. For example, I find it a terrible mistake that people picked Obama and all the stuff he had promised in the pass and still haven't kept his words. In my opinion, I think Obama daughter can build a better system than him. It whatever though, it the people choice that they want Obama to be president of the United States. I just think he just a liar to our nation. 
341	Humans perfom the same amount of emotions everyday.

It says that ""NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft was circling the planet,snapping photo possible landing sites for it's sister ship"". "
343	Also the negatives of the electoral college are not really a big deal that coud cause a fixing or a inbalenced vote towards one side over another 
344	What people thought who they picked was all for change, and just makes their own rules that not helping,but hurting everyone is why the smaller states are up set about it. 
345	That's why it isnt a good idea to be making driverless cars.

347	"According to Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother, when she had a car, she was always tense. Now that she told it, Walter seemed to be much happier. In Freiburg, Vurban's streets are ""care-free"". But, once you go to the main thoroughfare, cars will be sworming down the road. Most people may think, ""I need a car to get to where I need to go faster."" ""I can't live without a car.""  In 2006, trend in Europe grew... No cars or anything. Automobiles are the linchpin of suburbs where middle class families from Chicago to Shanghai make their homes. Passanger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions. 50 percent in some car intensive area in US. Home to 5,500 residents within a rectangular square mile, may be the most advanced experiment in low car suburban life.  Levittown and Scarsdale, New York suburbs with enormous rich people homes with private garages were dream towns back in the 1950s. The US is promoting ""car reduced"" communities, and legislators are starting to act. "
348	It should be on the peoples votes since they are the ones being affected by the changes. Not by the Electoral College.  The winner-take-all system is not fair what so ever. If there are more votes foe whatever president in that state then the electors will go for that president. This is like bandwagoning for football teams. If they go to the national championship they will change to that team. This voting shopuld change to the peoples votes instead of this winner-take-all system. It is more fair and balanced.  Think of it this way in 2012 that more people voted for Mitt Romney but the electors didnt think so that is unfair. Right? The voting needs to be changed once and for all to a popular vote system instead of the Electoral College. This is the best way for the United States to deal with this madness. One solution and you are one step forward to a better Nation.

350	No voting especailly in swing states can make your party, or your wanted candiadate loose the election.  Every year some of the swing states change so everyone should vote especially those in the swing states to insure your party or your candidate win.

352	The National Aeronautics and Space Administration has one particularly compelling idea for sending humans to study Venus. NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditiond on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray. If you image blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or more miles above the roiling Venusian landscap, it would be a shocker. Temperatures would still be tasty at around 170 degrees Fahrenheit, but the air pressure would ber close to the level of the sea and Earth.

Young children and people of all ages for that fact grow addicted to social media, video games, and many other things. The use of cell phones, which many people can not go anywhere without, harms the brain and kills the cells in your brain along with exposing your body to unneeded radiation.

As of April 2013, the number of miles driven per person was nearly 9 percent below the peak and equal to where the country was in January 1995.

367	With the Electoral collage it allows for us to make there a set number on the amount of votes we can get. That being said the Electoral collaeg wpuld make it alot easier so the states adn national governmant to get the right amount of votes. 
368	We need to look at the prons and cons cause a person can tell if a person is showing any emotion is how they are useing their mouth's muscular actions such as smiling or frowning. Telling a force one a real smile can be que trickey but a computer can tell the differences. 
369	Knowing your faults is one thing, but acting upon them is important. Many students, when given a choice in their work, will choose not to work hard or procrastinate upon them. I can attest to this myself, as I set many self projects for myself that I do not complete. Students who are hard working and care about their grade will complete their goals. 
370	Therefore those are my reasons for wanting to change the system of electoral voting to be changed to popular voteing. 
371	My conclusion is that if you think that havind an unshaped car is bad or even if it looks weird dont think that its a bad car because technology its changing our daily lifes and how we see the un expected about it.

376	In a nutshell, electoral college has its upsides and downsides and is still up today. I beileve its an easy thing to say it all depends on opinion and beilefs.    
377	"That may put people in danger sending the crew up there. We can only think and hope that the artifact was created by aliens.

383	Dr. Huang stated that his computer can identify a persons feeling just by scaning them. By the way it look the computer can verify a person experssions by the way that they look even thou some poeple in this world can understand expressions but techology is change and now it can nearly tell human emotion. But yet the differences here are that the computer can see emotions or no emotions at all.

But thats not what the the feel, they feel like they need to aprove the runners. ""why?"", you ask? I'm not sure. If they need to do all that, why dont the people of the House Of Representatives just make their decisions? Since it always come down to them, then there's no point of the U.S Citizens voting for president. But then agian, I feel like why should they choose who is the president? If the whole USA are the one's who need to worry about the president. "
386	Online school would be the best choice to many students that just have it the ruff way and not easy. 
387	The reason why people go out to vote, is because they have a specific person in mind. Although throughout election time, many people are brought to different conclusions that one candidate is better then the other, or they both have their flaws yet, they strongly represent one thing the other candidate dispises. Either way, there are those types of people who just cannot decide. They may be left undecided, and have changed their minds by the time it's ready to vote

And no matter who are what we vote for all were doing is expressing a political preference it dosent matter at all to them what we want all they care about is what they want and what they think is best.

Dr. Huang predict that "" A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored."" Another prediction that Dr. Huang did was that ""Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" Every human or most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication. "
391	There is a new software the has been developed that improves accuracy in perceiving the emotions of other. The Facial Action Coding System. They put a imagine of Mona Lisa Smile. In the applications called FACS knows how she is like how happy you are or angry. But with her they got a 83 percent happy, 9 percent disguested, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry. In the software is the latest innovation from prof. There is Thomas Huang, of the beckman institute for Advanced Science at the University of illinois, working in collaboration with prof. Also they actually calculate emotions like math homework and how a computer recognize the subtle facial movements we humans use to express , and how we feel. The computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the faces. And the facil expressions for each emotion are universal, observes Dr. Huang. Even though individuals often show varying degrees of expression like not smiling as broadly. With Mona Lisa demonstration is really intended to bring a smile to your face, while it shows just how much the computer can do. They are 3 things while you are looking in the mirror 1 is raise your lips at the comers of your mouth, 2 is squinting yours eyes slightly, to produce wrinkling at the comers of your eyes and 3 is holding that raise the outer parts of your cheeks up. Towars your eyes. The facial feedback theory of emotion, moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions, but also may even help produce them. Empathy feeling someone else's emotional state may happen because we unconsciously imitate another person's facial expressions. All that is about science or technology. 
392	In the second sentance of the fourth paragraph it explains that astronomers are curious because it may have been the most Earth like planet in our solar system. The planet resembles a surface with rocky sediment and includes things such as valleys, mountains, and craters.  In the fifth paragraph it states that NASA is coming up with possible solutions to avoid most of these issues. One of them is inventing is a small vehical that resembles a blimp floating 30 miles above Venus's landscape.

395	"The single best argument against the electoral collage is what might be what we (the american people) might call the disastor factor, We should consdier ourselves lucky that in the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a centry; the system can allow much worse. Back in 1960, segregationists in the Lousiana legislature nearly succeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy. (So that a popular vote for kennedy would not have actually gone to Kennedy)  ""Faithless"" electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party's canidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please. Perhaps most worrying is the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote, In that case, the election would be thrown to the House of Representives. Where state deleations vote on the president, and the senate would choose the vice-president. At the most basic level, he electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winner-take-all system in each state.  Canidates dont spend time in states they know they have no chance of winnning, focusing only on the tight races in the ""swing"" states. During the 2000 campain, seventeen sates didnt see the canidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didnt get to see a campain ad. If anyone has a good argument for putting the fate of the presidency in the hands of a few swing voters in Ohio, they have yet to make it... Originally the founding fathers estabished the electoral college in the Constitutuin as a compromise between election of the president by a vote in congress but i believe that the electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational! Some of the best arguments in favor of it are mostly assertions without much basis in reality "
396	but that doesn't mean that also doesn't mean that it might do a lot of things right either. 
397	I am truely appreciative of what you have done for my state, our city, and to help the country in so many ways that can not be explained. 
398	For example, if one thing in the electoral college is gone, then the whole thing may be affected by it. Also if theres no Electoral College then they wouldn't be any electors to select from and no counting of the electoral votes by congress. 
399	if we Electoral College vote it would be harder for us to vote. 
400	i know that i am very highly over them in academics and especially all sports. I bet i will go to a d1 university hopefully at NOTRE DAME for a starting wide receiver or cornerback position. In order to go to that prestigious d1 university you have to have a 4.2 gpa and a hell of a top football player in the country. 
401	"the single best argument against the electrol collages."" they would call it the disaster factor the reason for that is the american people should consider them self lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century ; the system allows much worse, consider that states legislaturs are technically responsible for picking electors, and that those electors i "" could always defy the will of the people."" proving my point making the peoples votes useless. "
402	The reason I think that the voting regulations is broken is that smaller states like Rhoad Island is a state that gets 3-10 votes and Claifonia gets 55 votes. If the only thing that make people happy is to be heard by the bigger people in life. If you where a 18 year old kid in a small state trying to make a  new product that could help millions but your in that state that wont let you be heard by the rest of the country.    
403	Advantages include 
404	The Electoral college is one by far the best things, It dont need to be taken from us. Many good things the college does. 
405	As you can see the Electoral College is really selfish. 
406	On the other hand i think making us students do community service because if the high school students or maybe middle school student decide to tutor elementary , the education will MOST LIKELY make progress 
407	So please think about this opportunity and please let this be aloud. 
408	Do you remember a time you hated cleaning you house?  Well if people hate doing that imagine them doing community service and how that don't have air conditioning like a house do its outside in the hot sunny day and just have water to drink sweet coming down your face. 
409	"Five reasons why the Electora College should be restained despite its lack of democratic."" The winners takes all bases"". What is that, why would we use that. In 2012 President Obama received 61.7% of the electoral votes compared to only 51.3% of the popular votes cast for him and Romney, says in source 3: In defence of the Electoral College. My point here is that we ""DO NOT"" need the Elecoral College. The voters in presidential elections are people who wants to express a  political preference rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election. "
410	Another big one is the people you talk to about your decisions. 
411	If we are being logical here we know that the pyrimads were created by humans them selves but do really think an alien could have done this? We do not think so because they are just not as smart and and not as equpit as a human is. We think that it was a land form God decided to give the planet. 
412	Why have so much going on when you can peacefully just count the votes of the voters and electors together? 
413	The dont need away getting nowhere if its online classes. 
414	The last source for the story talks about the defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President. Electoral College is widely regared as an anachronism and a non-democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be [overruled] by declasring the candidate who receives the most popular votes the winner. The advocatesos this postion are coorect in arguing that the Electoral College method is not democratic in a modern sense ... it is the electors who elect the president, not the people. Your votes for a presidential candidate your're actually voting for a slate of electors. There are a selects of parties that a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee.         
415	So then again maybe we should do community service. 
416	I believe that we American citizens should be able to vote. Our votes should all matter. We as a nation are one. One vote we all should be able to vote. 
417	The Mona lisa demonstration really intended to bring a smile to your face this while just imagine how a computer knows when you're happy or sad thats crazy. For example, if you smile as soon as a web ad appears on the screen another ad will follow. Lets say that you frown the next ad will be different from the one you smiled on. Another thing a classroom computer can know when students are becoming to be confused or bored.  How the start of the porcess is when the computer contracts a 3-D computer model of the face all of the 44 major muscles on the model must have move like human muscles. Eckamn has classified six emotions for example anger, surprise, fear, sadness and happiness. Movement for more than one muscle is called a unit.  In fact us human perfrom this impressive called calculation we use it everyday. For example, you could tell how your friend is feeling by looking at his or her face. most us would have trouble describing each others facial trit that makes us happy or worried. Yet Dr. Huang observes artist like Leonardo Da Vinci he studied human anatomy to help them paint facial muscles to have enough convey specific type of emoitions. 
418	Second of all people who favored the seperation of race. 
419	The Electoral College in the other hand, allows votes from states to be made. It is an easier method to get the states to vote for the president, and it takes less time. 
420	Many people also agree with me because according to source 2 it says that in case of the election it will be thrown to the House of Representatives where the delegations vote on the president. This way the delegation people can pick who's good for president. 
421	Al Gore won the popular vote but lost the presidency, over sixty percent would perfer a direct vote than have the elctoral college vote also. The vote could be very close even if one candidate wins by much in the popular vote due to the presidency vote. If there was a tie in the electoral vote the election would be thrown to the House of Represenstatives. Instead of all that work if there was only a popular vote it would be quick and simple. 
422	They probly ask more than 1 person becuase they want to see what different answer they can get. They also may becuase they might have a problem going on and don't know what to do and ask for help and advice. They also may be in a serious siuwation and need advice badly to make their next more. 
423	I feel like if you take an online class you have a greater chance of pasting to the next grade than me. I have an good and bad response to online classes. In an online class you have no consequences like student's in school have. Online classes is unique because you do what you want when you want. 
424	Luke crossed the Atlantic Ocean sixteen times and the Pacific Ocean twice, to help countries recover their food supplies, animals, and much more as it says in paragraph two. Even though it was a long journey across the oceans and the waters were rough 
425	because a computer that can read all 44 major muscles, and also this is where FACS will come in (Facial Action Coding System.) 
426	Well once again here is why i do agree and don't agree. i agree becuase it make scence that out of nowhere there is an unkown figure of a face on mars, but at the same time we do not know who did it. So we jump top conclusions that it ahd to be an ailen . But we have nop prrof that an alien is rwal and we have no proof that any of thid is real. 
427	Each passage has its own main part about Venus, however, it will tallk about the challenge that are face in Venus 
428	First and foremost the Electoral College is very old. 
429	People always seem to argue about this Electoral College, we calll it a disastor factor. 
430	and now there making technology that reads emotional expressions. 
431	The electoral college makes sure that no canidate recieves a maajority of the votes cast 
432	For projects with the intentions to keep students learning while on summer break the first issue would be students making projects on subjects that have no relevance to school, this would be very inefficient in the efforts made by school boards to keep students learning. 
433	But some students don't have phones, so don't think to hard about this 
434	this invention could fix so many problems that we have today. 
435	I feel like this type of technology has no purpose what so ever.  
436	not alot of people wanna know why she was sad this isnt from the artlicle nobody cares about why she was sad or happy leave her be what kind of test is this who the heck is gunna ask you what the heck happened in the passed its the passed it should stay there nobody in the world is gunna ask you what mood was mona lisa in in the picture who the heck cares its in the passed i didnt have to go into the artlicle to know this is stupid make fun of me if you please if someones reading this sure if its the computer when what the heck computer slide me a dub on this test me and you both know this isnt something will be asked in the future honestly tho who cares this is nonsense whos to really know if u were happy or sad or the picture was actually there to make u smile thats like me saying im here to be loyal then say im gunna cheat instead. you were not there to say that it was there for that one certin purpose no personal information but me and my girl arent together so that isnt my girl so i could lie and say she cheated or i can tell the truth n say she left cus i wasnt making her happy 
437	You might see students walking around school thinking about sports or other activities ,and that will be the only thing that they will be having on their mind. 
438	"""Each candidate running for President is your state has his or her own group of electors"" (5). ""The electors are generally chosen by the candidate's political party, but state laws vary on how the electors are selected and what their responsibilities are..."" (5). "
439	With kids having to have a B average and over all these years you would just have to have a C average, it would just mess everything up 
440	The advantages of limiting car usage 
441	This is what i think Lukes point of view for convincing people to come. 
442	Secondly, the Electoral College is very confusing for a voter who doesnt know how it works.   
443	the author want to show you all the data he picked up good and bad. 
444	Okay to end my letter, my con conclustion is that this is my letter to my state seator 
445	different perspectives 
446	That would be bad so the there are PROS and CONS about having phones at schools. 
447	the reason why i dont belive aliens are real beacuse i never heard one i never saw one with my own eyes and i also said the face dont look nothing like a alien. 
448	At the end of the artcle, the author finally mentions his viewpoint on the subject.  But during the actual article, it is not once mentioned that we should go to Venus. 
449	what if someone is fake smiling. is your technology going to be able to tell if your really happy or not? I think it not a good idea because one it doesnt tell you all the emotions that the person is feeling and what if the person doesnt want one or doesnt like it and they aloud ti get rid of it or do they have to keep it. I know i wouldnt want someone else to tell me my emotions so i surely dont want some technology telling me how i feel . 
450	i think he was like showing people and telling people about its so fun 
451	you go travel on the boat ride home and back but, you don't have to go sit around and watch from the boat. When you get off the boat you have a reward. If you like to see stuff like Europe, Italy, China, Greece then you'll love it. If you don't believe me ask Luke he's the one whos been to all those places. He said that the boat trips were so unbelievable for a small town boy like him.  
452	it would beneficial to them because people would be giving more money to them to try and find the aliens. this is yet another reason why it's not aliens 
453	Phones can interrupt many thing like dinner with family or study time for a big test that is coming up. 
454	Well I really think you should give us a try and see if it works but if it do it could or maybe stay that way. but I really think you should give us students a try and see if we can listen to the rules that u provided to us about our cell phones. and I know some of these students listen and some don't but if u try maybe something will work out for you and us students. 
455	When people ask for advice is because they want to know what things are better like to buy. 
456	"ONE OF THE TINGS THAT IS WRONG WITH IT IS ""UNDER THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE SYSTEM , VOTERS VOT NOT FOR PRESIDENT, BUT FOR A SLATE OF ELECTOERS, WHO IT Turn elect the president.  "
457	And those kids with disorders might love sports or other activities, and you are keeping them away from that. Wouldn't you feel bad knowing you would be taking away something that other people love to do. 
458	The new software can make 3-D models based off your face, to be able to do this software need to have fine accuracy. the software could identify humans emotions, but should be used in some cases. As in making computer-animated faces more expressive for video games or video surgery. 
459	Because if aliens were to make that face on Mars then that means they seen NASA's cameras circling their planet so they would've found a way to get them down. But I think it's a big pain in the butt to the people that think thier is alien life on a planet in our Solier System 
460	Using this tecnology is valuable because anatomy to allowed them paint facial muscles precisely enough to convey specific emotions. to how it's going to work on the compter. It's valuable because it can tell how Mona Lisa demontrates is really intended to bring a smile. 
461	Sometimes on the news there is either an accident or a suicide. It might involve someone not looking where they're going or tweet that someone sent. It either injury or death. If a mysterious number says I'm going to kill you and they know where you live but you don't know the person's contact ,It makes you puzzled and make you start to freak out. Which can end up really badly. 
462	Having good guidelines and being told what the expectations are will give students a better chance at success. 
463	The face on mars was a pictures that the vikings took from 1976. When vikings were snapping pictures of possible landing sites for its sister ship viking two. So we already know that there were pepole on mars before so they might of built the face on mars. 
464	The text explain correcthy each factor that Venus has, it also explain with details what are the dangers that being on Venus presents. 
465	"After voting in the election the governor makes a ""Certificate of Ascertainment,"" which is the list of the candidates who ran for presidant. Also, it shows who the winning candidate is in each state. Lastly the certificate is sent to the states congress to keep for records. "
466	Popular vote don't seem to matter, The Peoples vote don't seem to matter. 
467	Plus what would it hurt ? its not a painless unnoticable process that helps the students get a better education 
468	"Another reason is ""Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication."" "
469	But if I'm the scientist trying to figured out all this work,and see who's the human face or a alien face because humans on earth an aliens in Mars or more planets. But afterwards after that happening, it saids how some people think the Face is bona fide evidence of life on Mars evidence that NASA would rather hide, say conspiracy theorists. Meanwhile the defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an acient civilization on Mars. Also, although few scientists believed the Face was an alien artifact photographing Cydonia became a prioprity for NASA when Global Surveyor arrived at the Red Planet in September. 1997, eighteen long years ago after the Viking missions ended. 
470	I'm stil shocked that people think they're real. I've never seen one before 
471	i can connect this by simply looking at the picture and back couple years and to now how scientist reported no life for is on mars you will be boiled to death because it's also no oxygen so how can an alien create a face when no life form have been found yet. 
472	By students getting the chance to try new things they could step out of their comfort zone and get the chance to explore new talents. Within students exploring new things they gain knowlege and gain more expreince on ther project. 
473	i think if they were to put a cerfui on driving out at night time less bad stuff would happen let me explain my self. If i somthing were to happen to me like getting kid naped  and i dont retuen home by 3;30 yor gona knoe somthing is wrong and maybe it might even save my life.  then our goverment could make money by giving us tickets but hopefully its not a lot because ufortuanetly not every one has a little cash in there pockets like some of us do.  If in case it past the curfui and u need to get home you could just walk home or have the cops take you home beause all cops are free taxis. If you didnt know. its aslo totaly free. cops arnt just here to give you tickets. 
474	Venus a friend to earth and the closest to earth than any other planet. The density ,size are mostly the same, Venus,Mars is earth neightbor, orbit the sun at different,hottest planet. 
475	It shows you how much a computer can do. The computer knows when you are sad and happy. It's like a dog knowing when you are upset or happy. 
476	Venus has conditions that are far more extreme than anything humans can encounter on Earth 
477	Human curiosity is leading us to find more knowledge of our sister planet.   
478	it is chosen by a better educated person. 
479	Now that they Electoral votes are being distubuted evenly there is a smaller problem we face. Electors are the people who actully vote for our presidential canidate. Very rarely do these electors not choose the canidate based on the amount of votes they have been given, but it does happen. The electors are in a way chosen randomly but most of the time are chosen by the presidential canidate. Often these canidates do the right thing and vote based on votes gifen to him by the public 
480	i think we can help this community by helping,clean,stop littering and start helping everyone so that this world can live longer then the outher worlds did 
481	The Electoral College is widely regareded as an anachronism. but each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vte for he party's nominee. certainty of outcome is like percentage . the winner takes all basically.  
482	Finally, yes the technology is worth a big margin but its worth to have the help we can all get to help us know many. 
483	There are many things that can benefit from community service, there are also many things that can not be beneficial. 
484	I will be talking to you about how scientist's are thinking of putting things on the planet Venus and i wll also talk to you the fasinated thing our planet Venus has to offer. 
485	Paris enforces a driving ban to clear the air of the global city. Motorist with numbered licensed plates were ordered to leave their cars at there house or pay a fine of 31$. For this enforces over 4,000 drivers were fined. More than 20 peoplae got theit cars impounded for their reaction to the fine of paris. Diesel fuel company was blamed since France has a tax policy that favors diesel  over gasoline. Diesel fuel company makes up 67% of vehicles in France. For this kind of behavior Delivery companies complained for loss of buisness.  
486	in the text it states- twenty five years ago something funny happened around Mars. 
487	Everyone needs assistance every now and then. Like when you fall and someone helps you up, they are assisting you. One time I was on a board at my house and I fell off and broke my leg, but my friend was there and he carried me to the house. He assisted me by helping me to the house. 
488	"Some students in the Twenty-First Century are not willing to learn about certain topics in school because of all the other amazing internet resources and games they think are part of computer freedom, but inspite of Three- Dimentinal vision, Mona Lisa could have been much angrier than what she might have seemed like in her face, and she might have been fearful because of her hair style and her looks ""in the dark!"" Maybe, there was a possibility that a demostration of Mona Lisa could test how well with a(n) computer with ""2020 Vision Software"", or have a(n) emotional sensor flashdrive to attach to your PC Engine when you want there to be certain conducting over feelings from your computer technology "
489	Being kicked out of school can be good or bad. 
490	Even when these children are done with their homework they have free time and have the choice on what to do, which usually leads to T.V., video games, eating, computer... exedra. I think if these few extra hours lead to sports, it would be okay. If kids take the time and put in the effort to fit in sports and schooling in one schedule, I think that everything would be great 
491	"As the author talks about in paragaph 8 it says,""Been tested in a chamber simulation the chaos of Venus. "" This meaning to this is how many things had been tested and seen. Therefore they are dicovering new stuff in this century "
492	Selecting the Electors,the meeting for the president and vice president,and the counting of electoral votes by congress is a better idea than 60 percent of voters  prefering a direct election to kind we have now. I understand that under the  Electoral College system,voters vote not for the president but for a slate of electors,who turn elect the president. If you lived in texas for instance and wanted to vote for john kerry you'd vote for a slate of 34 democratic electors pledged to kerry,On the off-chance that those electors won the statewide election they would go to congress and kerry would get 34 lectoral votes. Each candidate running for president in your state has his or her own group of electors. The electors are generally chosen by the candidates,s political party, but state laws vary on how the electors are selected and what their reponsibilities are. At the most basic level the  Electoral College is unfair to voters because of the winner take all system in each state,canidatdes dont spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning.  Election by popular vote for the president of the  United States  Obama received 61.7 percent of the electoral votes compared to only 51.3 percent of the popular votes cast for him and romney becausw almost all states award electoral votes on a winner take all basis even a very slight plurality in a state creates a landslide electoral vote victory in that state. A tie in a nationwide electoral vote is possible because the total number of votes 538 is an even number,but it is highly unlikely but each party selcts a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee it is entirely possible that the winner of the electoral vote will not win the national popular vote. Yet that has happened very rarely. It happened in 2000, when Gore had more popular votes than bush yet fewer electoral votes,but that was the first time since 1888 thats happened. there are five reasons for reraining the electoral college despite its lackof democratic pedigree all practical reasons not liberal or conservative reasons. A disput ove routcome of an electoral college vote is possible it happened in 2000 but it's less likley than a dispute over the popular vote. 
493	Now it is possible for somebody to secretly change the names that way but it is a higher stake, or risk to take not having the Electoral College. 
494	No one knows how the face changes, maybe it's aliens, maybe it's natrual to change, maybe it's getting older. 
495	Sometimes the votes get overulled by the popular vote. The electors really only focus on the swing states. That`s just not right at all. 
496	"It's kind of like when you're at a crossroads.  You and someone else get there at the same time.  They're to your right, so they have the right of way and can go first.  It doesn't matter that you got there at the same exact time, or even if you're going somewhere more important than where they're going.  It's like that with the election.  The Electoral College and the state may both be voting, but the Electoral College has the ""right of way"" and has more importance over us, whether they care who they're voting for or not. "
497	Sightseeing is something that can make you glad you toke up the job. The things you could see are things that you probably won't see at home. These sights can also teach you something about the country 
498	It's really sad when you think about it, people have developed skills and strategies to make it look like they're not on the phone. 
499	children in our school have the knowledge to know when community service should be done 
500	""" After the presidential election, your governor a 'certificate' of scertainment' listing all of the candidates who ran for president in your state along with the names of their respective electors."" the responsability the electoral college is better status. the candidate is going election and promosion for going electives'' However, maine and Nebraska each have a variation of '' proprotional representation..'' "
501	so its a landform with a face but the shadows make up the face. NASA has been studying this for a long time,but for what ?, as you bcan see its just a landform not a face.  
502	"First off, Venus is one of the brightest points of light, making it simple for stargazers. Often called the Ëvening Star"" but the nickname can be misleadinng since the planet Venus is...well a planet. While also very simple to see from the distant safe advantage of Earth, it proves to be a very challenging place to examine more closer. It makes you wonder what´s even that planet to study about.  Next, Venus´ surface has their temperature average over 800 degrees and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than we experience on our planet. The planet´s conditions Venus has is way more extreme than we thought it would be that we wouldn´t be accustomed to the second we even try to get there. Beyond the high pressure and the heat, Venusian geology and weather present some impediments like volcanoes that can erupt, earthquakes, and frequent lightning strikes to seek land onto its surface. No wonder why Venus is fascinatiing in some people´s eyes.  Lastly, going over to Venus with a ship orbiting or hovering safely far above the planet can only have a limit insight on ground conditions since most of the forms can´t penetrate the dense atmosphere. It´s important to know that researchers cannot take samples of any rock, grass, or anything else in the distance. So if trying to seek to a conduct would have to resolve in getting close and personal despite any risks to do it. "
503	Everyone should just vote for the vice president and the president. People are voting for the Electoral college while they should be voting to see who will be their new president. The electoral college is getting more votes than the president should be getting. 
504	For instance, if you lived in Texas, & wanted to vote for John Kerry, you would be voting for a slate of 34 Democratic electors pledged to Kerry. The electors can be anyone not holding public office. It depends on the state to pick the electors in first place. 
505	"NASA had sent mutuple objets to mars. The objet semes to only servive fore some few three weeks. In oder to make somthing beter to sent in Venus is lookng at obld technology. Looking at phragraph siven it tells us that ""Another project is looking back to an old technology called mechanical computers."". NASA uesd newer technology but it has not over three weeks. Sending mechens that are made with meatel it will mealt or over heat because of the heat in Venus. With the old mechens and with the newer we will fined a more resestent salustion that can healp us with information. "
506	This history is about Venus 
507	Schools is a place where students have the desition by you're own. There is where students can start makeing options and try finish what they really dream. Be able to atted classes from home is hard thing to discuss but when students are able to go there is great bacause is where they have to be and never give up during that time. 
508	I would say you could but it all depends because you can't really tell because he can have a face emotion that you see him with everyday that don't mean that he happy it can mean that he mad or sad or tired.  
509	cause at some point in time the people will start to get angry about the whole emotions crap and maybe get rid of them, they may like at first but one day their just gonna get rid of it.  
510	 I support and do not support this at ther same time. i support it because I feel it could be helpful but I do not suppot this because I feel if a child needs help with how they are feeling they will go to an adult they trust, weather it be a teacher at school or a parent or even a friend at achool.   
511	Astronomers also believed Venus was once covered largely with Oceans could have supported various form of life we may have not been familiar with just like on Earth. Venus also some things that are simlar to Earth such as the rocky surface that include familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters. Venus can also be considered our nearest option for a planetary visit, which is a crucial consideration given the long time frames of space travel.  
512	"""270 electoral votes is requierd to elect the president"",this indicates that we dont really have control of picking the president. ""it's possible that the winner of the electoral vote will not win the national popular vote"", but does'nt often happen. "
513	Especially cars, way back people didn't depend on cars, because they weren't even invented, but they had to walk where ever they needed or wanted to go. Whether women were with child, someone had a broken leg, or u could've been sick. Either way, they still kept going until the reached their destination. They couldn't depend on all the technology we have today. 
514	They can stop worrying about foolishness and do their jobs. 
515	Driver good is very important for all people. In the united states' there are  much car and this provoke much accidents in the life of the people. The president Obama's say: in the united states' greenhouse gas emissions, unveiled last week, will get a fortuitous assist from an incipient shift in american behavior: recent studies suggest that americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by.  In the united states peaked in 2005 and dropped steadily thereafter, according to an analysis by doug short of advisor perspectives, an investment research company. As april 2013 the nombers of miles driven per person was nearly 9 percent below the peak and equal to where the country was in January 1995. Part of the explanation certainly lies in the recession,because cash-strapped Americans could not afford new cars, and the unemployed weren't going to work anyway.''I think means something more fundamental is going on''.The transportation is the second largest source of Ameica's emissions, just behind power plants. But it could have negative implications for thr car industry. Diferent things are converging which suggest that we are witnessing a long -term cultural shift, said Mimi Sheller, a sociology professor at drexel university and director of its mobilities research and policy center. She cities various factors:the internet makes telecommuting possible feel more connected without driving to meet friends. The precident Obama is very good with the country because this words what he say ser very important for the all people and the world.    
516	Second, I hink this option for learning offer the class in distance wich a attend classes from home 
517	Schools are meant for students to learn on other subjects. If a student takes classes in school they will have the opportunity to learn much better. 
518	To begin with, The Electoral College is a process. 
519	First of all, It is good to know that, because looking at old photographs taken you can see if the person is happy or not. 
520	To inform fellow citizens about advantages of limiting car usage you would have to tell them everything 
521	_And it can by hard for the students to graduate because can affect they attend in the school and will many students going to skiping because they can come in the school but they can leave early because they can find a excuse to to leave and to do the attendece at home or just skiping classes and don't doing nothing. Well it okay to come in the school every day because if one has attend in home then all students wasts to have attend at home  
522	"Out of all the plants in the universe, I didn't think that there was going to be another ""Earth."" Many perople are scraed to travel out side of earth. I would also be scared. There is one "" Earth-like "" planet. Venus has very dangerous charateristics. "
523	if they dont want to they shouldnt have to maybe if they like doing student council, sports or working on the schools yearbook then they can. 
524	There are many advantages of limiting car usage 
525	Over years, we voted for the Electoral College it consits of voting for President and Vice President 
526	To me, I'd thought that it wouldn't be worth all the trouble to study more of this when we can study other planets like mars that support life better than Venus since it's surface and atmosphere wasn't as crazy as Venus'. 
527	We already have too many problems involving cars that we don't need to add any more. The people who are involved in creating the driverless cars should focus on making sure that the railroads are safe before trying to come up with anything new. I think that creating theese new cars is already to much work. It would involve creating the sensors, changing the breaks, and making new computer hardware and software. Theese things will not protect us from getting into accidents or having cars crashes which should be our main focus. 
528	I believe that it would be a good policy if students followed this policy, though most student don't follow most of the rules in school anyways. 
529	I'm writing you this note to express my opinian wether or not to keep the Electoral College or to get rid of the Electoral College. 
530	faster to calculate 
531	The Mona Lisa demonstration is really intended to bring a smile to are face, while in the computer it shows it in how much it can do 
532	"I agree with this for two reasons. First, becuase it does allow the people to vote for the president or canididate they prefer. Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but slate of electors, who turn elect the president, as stated by ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best- laid defenses of the system are wrong"". I strongly agree with that except from the article I have stated. "
533	another reason is that it would help the men and women who have to clean and pick up trash every day.  
534	This image we see has beeing used and talked about in many places such as Hollywood films, books, magazines, radio stations, talk shows, and grocery stores. 
535	cameras have many fuctions and are very smart for take of pictures, the new cell phones have this technology one example is Iphone 7 or Galaxy 8 this smartphones have many technology, they know when are you sad or happy they have a special camera.  The news computers have many technology they are the best for this work because you can modify of system , you can put one camera and stard to work, you need create of program for analized of expretions and you can suporting with other student .  One need put of front to the camera and other need take picture and analized in computer, the next step is analized the facial expretions and see the muscles his face, eyes, cheeks or his smile the computer need analized the information and procces.  First student have a natural smile and computer detected this, he is happy, next student are crying, computer analized he is sad. but when student have pockarface the computer no detected nothing because no have any emotions, but what happen when one student make falce smile, but this is really good, I think of the computer detected he is happy.  
536	Well the President always say's God Bless America. Shouldn't the President be listening to the voices of his country. America 
537	Humans need food, water, and air to live, but that doesn't mean that aliens do. They could be like plants and create their own food inside their bodies. As for water, NASA has discovered that there used to be water on the moon, so what is there to believe there couldn't be any water anywhere else.  People can be very religious and about the Bible and God, but other people can be all about evolution and not creation. If humans evolved from animals, then we might not be the only ones. Which means that if humans can evolve into humans, then other organisms can evolve, also. 
538	but they still haven't done any harm to the American society. 
539	You are of course entitled to your own opinion, 
540	also a lot of schools do a horrible almost a illegal jobs and reading kids emotions and helping there students 
541	EX: you sent them to go pick up trash and they go and they are just playing around they are going to be fighting with the trash throwing it where it was clean then later when they finish playing they are going to see a mess that they are going to get lazy and just walk away and go to another place where its cleaner and if they are trouble makers they are going to do that over and over again. 
542	Also many kids may think that its a bad idea but trying different things in the classroom could help many kids out. And the teachers would love that. But even if its not good the teacher wouldn't have to keep using it. 
543	and it wouldn't be facing towards the sky, it would be like a statue, plus it would have been a really fantastic descovery and we would try to make contact with the martians and see how they live and survive on the planet so we could possibly live there one day. NASA would send space crafts and rovers to Mars so we could study the creatures. Finding out how to survive on mars and the other planets is important and is something humans should learn how to do just in case if something happens to earth and we aren't able to go back to it. 
544	Even only a little bit of scientists believe the face was an alien articraft.' 
545	promoting 
546	Having election by popular votes for the presidents can make our community's can help people get together and talk about which president is better or which on they think has more potential helping out the society 
547	"car usage is becoming less popular, this is because of ""no car days"" and people just not bothering to get a car or a license. "
548	This is offical: The electoral colllege is unfair, oudated and irrational. 
549	If people want to change the election for popular votes  is basically your generallly chosen by the candidates politcal party...and what their responsibilities are 
550	Some kids are to scared to play any sports or join in a school activity, because they are shy to talk to people. After all you get to have a lot of fun playing with your friends after school. 
551	Throughout the article the author talks about Venus and others planets in out solar system. but he mainly talks about Venus and Mars. 
552	Like just imagine all the craters and the amazement for people all ages. Why sit at home when you can be emjoying yourself with various adventures. 
553	For example: when I was tine grade I remember my friend PROPER_NAME she was eleven grade.  She try to offer the distance for her friend by making video. When She was school from home. Then, she started showing the way. On that time, she wasn't take care her self because she was focusing the video.  Next, she try to cross the way by raining. She didn't pay attention the way and she got car accident. On that time she passed away she died. 
554	"because the electoral college is a process not a place. The founding father established it in the constitition as the compromise between election of the President by a popular vote. The electoral college cobsists of 538 electors. A majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the president. Your state's entitles allotment of electors equals the number of members in its congressional delegation: one for each memeber in the house of representatives plus two for your senators. Each candiate running for president in your state has hin or her own group of electors. The Electors are generally chosen by the candidate's political party, but state laws vary on how how the electors are selected and what their responsibilities are.  The presidential election is held every four years on the tuesday after the first monday in november. You help choose your state's electors when you vote for President  because when you vote for your candidate  you actually voting for your candidate's electors. After the presidential election, your governor prepares a ""Certifacte of Ascertainent"" lsiting all of the candidates  who ran for president in your state along  with the names of their respective electors. The Certificate of Ascertainment also declares the winning presidential candidate in your state and shows which electors will represent your state  at the meeting of the electors in december of the election year. Your state's certificates of acertainments are sent to the congres and the national archives as part of the official records of the presential election.  Under the electoral college system, voters not for the president, but for a state of electors, who in turn elect the president. if you lived in texas, for example, and and wanted to vote for john kerry, you'd vote for a slate of democatic  electors pledged to kerry. On the off-chance that those electors won the statewide election, they would go to congress and kerry would get 34 electoral votes. Who are the electors? They can anyone not holding public office it depends on the state. That is how it works this is my reason.    "
555	Why would you want to limit car usage. 
556	I should go neither everybody need their will to vote what they want to do or spend their summer break as they like. 
557	But I think it is a good reason why it has to be a B average it's because if u have a B or below than a B u can get kicked off the team or your activity. 
558	Opponents say that cell phones are good because they give an opportunity to make a call in case of emergency. 
559	Almost all the states award electoral votes with the winner-takes- all mehtod that they created 
560	Doing this can help you be more aware of the people in need and help you know that you have been great help to them. This program hires men to take care of the horses, cows, and mules that were shipped over seas. This can make you come closer to the animals and let them know that you care very much for them! 
561	student would also have time on their projects. 
562	Venus's thick atmosphere is made up of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide, which blankets the whole planet. The average temperature is about 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater that what we experience. Scientists should know that if they try and send a spacecraft full of men to Venus and land they are risking lives. 
563	How come everyone doesnt vote for who thy want by themselves ? Maybe someone whats a president frome another state instead of their own .According to paragraph fourteen , It states that the electoral college is unfair , outdated and irrational and i agree one hundred percent . As Bob Dole Says Abolish the Electoral College . 
564	Knowing their vote will not effect they will have less time to pay attention to the campaign than they would have if the president were picked by popular vote. 
565	By that I want to totally help to clean up our school ! 
566	because it would put more work on the poll workers because they would have to count all the votes for each president. If they miss a few votes the wrong person could be elected as president. 
567	Thats why its good for people to studdy about thinks an just do so they would know what they getting into .earth right now never sound back to me but earing an learing about differnt plants that maybe we might be able to vist in years is aswome to learn an hear about that its not just one plant we could live on. 
568	You could help the countries recover their food supply, animals, and more. It could be fun caring for an animal like it was your own pet. 
569	Sure, using your mouth muscles revealing emotions is easy, but it can be a bit hard for those with stage fright or insocial status to show emotions around strangers, thats why this inventions is a great thing to me to know and have in the world of mysteries. 
570	Multiple reasons where given such as comparing Venus to Earth, 
571	He/she explained everything about Venus, The size, were its located, how hot it is etc. I think this cause in passage 1,2,3 it gives alot of information on Venus. And the author organized the facts really well by putting alot of facts in each paragraph and focusing on that and giving alot of information on that subject. In paragraph 4 it talks about how Venus is almost like the earth and how maybe one day they would like too visit. This is a huge thing cause if so we could have another planet of life 
572	don't listen to everyone you see because it might end up backfiring on you in the long run.  
573	Venus is actually a planet. in our system solar. Venus is the second planet from our sun. Venus is the closest planet planet to Earth in terms of density and size. Venus is sometimes we are closer to  Mars and others time to Venus. On the planet's surface, temperatures averange over 800 degrees fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater. Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system.  Venus was probably covered largely with Oceans and could have supported varios forms of life just like earth, today Venus still has some features that are sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains and craters, furthermore, recal that Venus can some times be our nearest option for aplanetary visit people like visit at planet Venus they want know about the planet. The scientists say tha planet is delete at de solar system because Venus is a little planet in solar system it was delate. approaches to studying Venus. for example, some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of venus's surface and lasted for trhee weeks in souch conditions. human curiosity know more about Venus the little planet in solar system. In planet Venus there not are life, people can live there at the planet Venus, Only in this planet are life. 
574	This face shaped mound on mars has just thrown all the theories out and has caused a big worry in the world. Personally I did not see the face until i had read through the article pretty much pin-pointing all of the features, so i went back to the picture of the face and that when i did see it. One persons theory has caused problems for everything from t. v. to conversations. 
575	Then they might even fail the grade there in. But people who have a B should be able to choose a sport because there doing well in school. And not failing in school there tried hard so they should be able to choose a sport that they like. But if they start doing bad in school or not doing there homework and start to get an F they should talk to the student. And tell him/her if they have a sport and still have  B average or in the next test they take and get an F. there going to have take away there sport till she /he has better grades. 
576	So this is why my claim is what it is. 
577	The single best argument agaisnst the electorsal college is what they might call the disaster factor. they the people in american should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century; the system allows for much worse. is the most worrying  the prospect of s tie in the electoral vote. In that case, the election would be thrwn to the house of representatives, where state delegation vote on the presendent. And the thing is that the senate would choose the vice-presendent. because each state cast only one vote, the single representative from wyoming, representing 5000,000 votes would have sa much say as the 55 representative from carofornia, who represent 35 million votes.    
578	"In this world, we want to gain more knowlege to better understand what's around us.  Now, scientists want to be in the next level of understanding. They want to gain more information about the Venus. Venus is also called,""Evening Star.""  They know that it is a very dangerous thing to accomplish. However, they're still doing it anyway. The author even says,""Is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet."" He also said,"" To contribute meaningfully to our knowlege of Venus.""  Scientists study many things, they explore many planets: Such as Moon, Mercury, Saturn, etc. But this, it's beyond what numbers of people to even imagine doing it. "
579	You might find an uncharted island and make a lot of money off of it. 
580	In paragraph the author is describing how Venus was like a long time ago, covered with large oceans and that it could of have supported various forms of life. The author also describes how the planet looks like today with rocks, valleys, and mountains.  
581	"Next, the figure similar to a ""face"" is to big to be a real face. "
582	I think this face is a natural landform. 
583	The college is a process,not a place. The process consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for president and vice. The counting of electoral voters by congress. State's entitled allotment of electors equals the number of members in its congressional delegation. 
584	and there is many wierd things on this planet with weird shapes, it cant always be martians or aliens. 
585	A lot of the student body gets upset because the president promises something and it never happenes and then it turns in a big rivarly between everyone. We learn abut politics in our geography and i think the us as the student body shouldn't be worried about politics as much because then the student body will think that it is ok to do what the politics do and say. 
586	after school activity like sport can school clubs can also be on your patent reared all out throw out high school and on to college and thats why i think that student should participate in one or more extracurricular activity.        
587	Honestly helping someone would feel great. 
588	A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets venus, its even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric aciod in venus's atmosphere. it is usually 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and sometimes the atmosphere pressure is 90 times greater than what we experince on our own planet. All thought these conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on earth.  Also venus has the hottest surface temperture of any planet in our solar system. Even though mercury is closer to our sun. Venusian geology and weather present additional impediments like erupting volcannoes powerful earthquakes are frequent lightning strikes to probes seeking to land on its surface.  NASA is working on other approaches to studying venus. For an example some simplified electronics made of slilcon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of venus's surface and have lasted for three weeks in such conditions. These devices were first envisioned in 1800s and played an important role in the 1940s during world war II. Modern computers exidting in those days may sound schoking but these devices make calculations by using gears and levers and do not require electronics at all.  Striving to meet the challenge presented by venus has value not only because pf the insight to be gained on the planet itself but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors. 
589	The police could use this machine to find out if criminals are lying about what they did. Parents would also be mad that teachers are using the machine on their children 
590	Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city. It is either leave your cars at home or suffer with a fine of 22-euro on mondays with even-numbered license plates and the same with the odd-numbered plates the following day. Because Paris typically has more smog than other European, delivery companies complained of lost revenue, while exceptions were made for plug-in cars, hybrids, and cars carrying 3 or more passengers. 
591	Although the Face looks like a face, it may have not been built by aliens. 
592	People have always thought that there were aliens on Mars. This time there actually could be one on Mars. Life on Mars could be a real thing. Mars is a eird place because it is red, unlike Earth which is mostly blue and green. 
593	Us as a NASA team we work hard to solve what it was such as reasearch, scientists working, and our team that snapped the picture. 
594	what i mean by that is most of the time no one cares about your opinion or theres and asking them for their opinion can really impact their life a lot because you probably brighten their day by putting a smile on their face. 
595	So if you really feel the need of taking down the collage go ahead and do it. It will be better and in the future we can make another one and make it bigger and better then the one we have right know. 
596	One reason they should take down the electoral college is to same money because some of the goverments money  goes to that college that they dont pay for. 
597	We jsut have no evidence proveing wether or not this is an alien artifact or its just a natual landform.        
598	"""Beyond high pressure and hean, Venusian geography and weather present additional impediments like erupting volcanoes, powerful eathquakes, and frequent lightning strikes to probes seeking to land on its surface""(Paragraph 3).  "
599	The scientists also believed that the face that is on Mars arrived on Mars in September 1997. 
600	The Author supports this idea because he or she says Venus is too dangerous for astronuts to go to and study. 
601	The electoral college consists of 538 electoral. The amendment 23rd gives us ower rights. 
602	"The text states, ""According to the Facial Feedback Theory of Emotion, moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions, but also may even help produce them."" New technology is able to detect human emotions, even when the person is hiding them. "" To an expert, faces do not lie; these muscle clues are sometimes used to spot when a ""smiling"" politician or celebrity is not being truthful."" The computer software can detect human emotions from paintings, picture, and in person.   "
603	Under this system, voters vote not for the president, but for the state of electors. which who  in turn elect the president. For example, if u lived in texas, and wanted to vote for John Kerry, you dont vote for a slate of 34 democratic electors pledged to Kerry. 
604	To me I still dont think thats enough evidence and detail to say I would stay home. 
605	Scientists have been studying Venus for generations, wondering what could possibly be on a planet so close to ours. Now that we don't have to wonder anymore, NASA will try to take it one step higher. They want to be as close to Venus' ground as possible, without dying.  
606	But, students must know their limitations whenever they use their phones or gadgets inside the campus. 
607	because if it was turned into a popular vote election people who voted for a specific president wouldn't have won just because they aren't popular amongst the people that are voters iin that year's election 
608	If you even had a chance to explore something different and be part of it, would you? 
609	If you do make the rule that students cannot bring cell phones at least consider keeping record of how may times each student has been caught with their cell phone and make it a set number of times they can be caught with it until they are severely punished( at least once).  
610	you get ideas from other people  Supporting detail number 2: you get multiple opinions  Restate thesis: hearing multiple ideas gives you many options of advice you can take from ideas and multiple opinions. 
611	Many votes have been barely won because the numbers are so close and high 
612	This causes lots of people to rage on the Electoral college because they feel that the state is taking there right to vote and to be different. 
613	What if that one vote changes our basic ways to live. What if that one vote can take away some of our rights. What if one vote can make the world turn into yet another great depression. 
614	Another reason we should keep the college method is because it wouldnt take that long. 
615	I honestly think that the idea of having All students perform community service may be a good idea, but it can also not be a bad idea. 
616	Most voters that end up in swing states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign as it states in paragraph twenty. 
617	because if they can do it they shouldnt make other people wanna do it,but i would also work on the yearbooks beacuse you are the one who is doing it all so you do it the way u want to 
618	If you were to notice a student feeling sad or lonely, you find out the problem and solve it. If a student was mad or upset, you could fix that too. This might create less violence in schools and higher school attendence rates. It could prevent fights and arguements between teachers and students. It could also prevent bullying 
619	"In the article ""The Challenge od Exploring Venus,"" the author states that NASA has a compelling idea to send humans to Venus to study it."" "
620	The text also state even a vehicl will have so much time to hovering over venus because the light can't penetrate the dense atmosphere. More importantly resher can't take anything because it is dense atmosphere. Fot them to seeking any info thay would have to get up close and personal despite the risks. Having knowledge fo venus meney researcher are working on some simplifed electronice.  The National Aeronautis and space Administration have a idea for sending humans with haveing bad condush. At Venus temperatures would be around 170 degrees fahrenheit. Stat frome the text researchers are working on innvations that would alloe our mechines to last longer enought to contribute meningfully to our knowedge of Venus. NASA is working on other approaches to studying Venus. 
621	This process of electoral college does not give the full rights to the voters... its not fair. 
622	"The Electoral College was a process created by the four fathers in the Constitution to established the election of the ""President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens.""-  Source 1: What Is the Electrol College,paragraph 1.  The Electoral College consists of 538 electors. Majority electorcal votes for President is 270. ""Congressional delegtion: On for each member in the House of Representatives plus two for your Senators.""-  Paragrah 2,What Is the Electoral College.  Yes this involves in the 23rd Amendment of the Contitution that Washington D.C or District or Columbia is allocated 3 electors and is treated like a state in the Electoral College. The electors for a candidate running for President has a group of electors generally by his/her's political party. "
623	They can hurt kids and cause road problems. They could even mess up their jobs focusing on their phone and not the objective. Devices can become over powering.  
624	.Being a Democrat myself the way the Electoral Collage is set up is absolutely preposterous.  
625	I think that participating in the Seagoing Cowboys program is not a good idea and heres why, 
626	One why in the world would you want to know soemones mood you dont know what they were going threw thats history hwat they were feeling let the past stay in the passed 
627	"There is two sides to this picture of a ""face"" either you think it is a sing of life or it is a mesa. So, the figure similar to a face isn't a face because it is similar to landforms on Earth, the figure is to big to be a real face, and it is actually a mesa. "
628	Plus they say that technology is going to take over the world, this just might be another reason for this to may be happen. 
629	also don't you see all that violence out there 
630	It states in the text that your freontailis pars lateralis muscle (above your eyes) raises your eyebrows when you're surprised 
631	popular vote was very close in Florida (2012) 
632	An example is giving out food to the homeless. By doing this, people who do not get food regularly have the chance to get some for sure. 
633	in fact it takes more time by deciding state representatives and so on and so forth. i really couldn't think of any other reasons you would want such a corrupt system like thus one. this system is obscured. 
634	Some students this way might not pay attention. Also they can use thier phone or do other stuff while the teacher is teaching and their grades could go down fast. 
635	either way extra curriculars are never as fun when you're told you have to do them. 
636	"with its rocky terrain and with that Astronmers are fascinated. ""If our sister planet is so inhospitable, why are scientists even discussing further visits to its sureface? Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system "
637	we can also make this planet our planetary,  
638	In Conclusion I think that the we should keep Electoral Colleges and changing to election by popular voting to vote for a President.   
639	Electoral Colleges has selection of electors witch makings them vote for the President/Vice President. 
640	an electoral collage tells there president where to go and give there speechs. 
641	The only thing you can really do is pray for the best to happen and keep living your life. I feel like every driver should be at least 17+ driving because at the age i feel like a little more common sense it should know by now what the rules are. 
642	I conclued that the face will be there forever and ever. The Aliens did not fine the face. I am so mad that the you think that the aliens found the face but they did not The scientist found it so think again because if the Aliens did found out that they did find it then we should say sorry to the Aliens for thinking that we found it. I say That we should discuss with our own sicentist to find out who found the face on mars. 
643	To be honest, that isnt fair that they get a vote. Who are they going to choose when it comes to voting? Someone trying to help us move forward or someone making our tax money got to the people who dont want to get off there lazy butt and do something. I do not know 100% of the facts on who can vote or not, but if a bum sitting on state road 70 all day begging for money just so he can go buy beer, seems unfair that he should even get a vote. In my opinion half of the population will end up voting for someone because, of what bad benefits he is offering and then we will be stuck with another bad president for another 4 years! Who knows more about congress then our congress? Lets be a honest here, do we really want all our tax money going to families with 8 kids and cant afford 2 or the bums on the side of the road begging for money or the trashy people hitting up crack ever time they get a little bit of money? Not me! 
644	Is there really a new kind of life on mars. No! We are the only life in this universe. Plus if people lived on mars, how could they build such a huge amount of rock into a face so perfectly. 
645	the by them doin gthis alot of kids can fail reason why i say this things because i know students im am one; that me explain to you why I say this . 
646	Techonoly today becomes very important, and useful for all of the peoples in the world. 
647	I think alot of people take the whole no car thing the wrong way, cause lets face it there no way we could go without cars. 
648	Reason of this teens. 
649	in the article it says that numerous spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours, maybe thiss issue explains why nit a single spaceship has touched down on Venus more than three decades, Numerous factors contribute to Venus's reputation as a challenging planet for humans to studydespite its proximity to us. Also, the temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our planet. Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system, even though Mercury is closer to our sun. Venusian geology and weather present additional impediments like erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning strikes to probes seeking land on surface. However, peering at Venus from a ship orbiting or hovering safely far above the planet can provide only limited insight on ground conditions because most forms of light cannot penetrate the dense atmosphere,rendering standard forms of photography the dense videography ineffective. Venus is so hot that it can melt metal. 
650	"After days of near record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city. Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five-days of intensifying smog. The smog rivaled Bejing, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world.  In Bogota, Columbua, there is a program that's set to spread to other countries, millions of Columbians hikes, biked, skated or took buses to work during a car-free day, leaving the streets of this capital city eerily deviod of traffic jams. ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,"" said businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza as he rode a two-seat bicycle with his wife. "
651	But that is what i woud do if I was a sientist that worked for NASA abd there was a big argument about what it was then that is what I would do to see just make a camera to see which one was right me or the guy in the lab. Hopfully I would even be able to build that if i was a scientist that worked for NASA.      
652	Kids with these issues tend to have an even harder time learning in the traditional classroom environment and would benefit largely being able to learn from home. 
653	Dr. Huang has came up with a computer that can read human emotion's.  Now Dr. Huang's computer syestem can tell six human emotion's and let me tell u somthing human's only have six emotion's those emotions are (happiness, surprised, angery, disgusted, fear, and sadness). 
654	I think the better way for the car problems, is to have all people discuss the problems and explain what is best for other people. 
655	because it consists of 538 electors and the majority (270) that are the electoral votes that are required to elect a president. 
656	"For example my first evidence that i found in this article is when said that ""Mona Lise is 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry"". So, is trying to tell us that to making Mona Lise smile can be a difficult way, because she had too many differents emotions at the same time,but nothing is impossible. But also the people trying to describe a new technology to identify humans emotion. The new technology is called FACS ( Facial Action Coding System). This is the new technolody that the author wanted to used to find the humans emotions, , and see which one of the two option that they had can be more easy or more faster to find the human emotions.  My other example that also i found in this article is when said that ""according to the new computers softward can recogniza emotion. The softward is the least innovation from Prof. Thomas Haung, of the Backman institute for advanced science at the University Illions."" The author is trying to tell us to describes the new tecnology was little complicated because with he wanted to describe that technology to see if will be more easy to identify the emotions. Also in this article said that the process begings when the computer construct a 3D computer of the face, all 44 muscles in the model must move like human muscles. That why i think that describes that new techology wasn't eassy because the new technology need to identify all about human. "
657	so the electors can be anyone not holding public office. the state picks on the electors and sometimes state conventions and state partys central committe and the presidental candidates themselves. so  what i am saying is that if change to popular vote  it willshare the candidate share of the electoral college and invariably eceeds his share of the popular vote. 
658	and this could mean ruining the techology or worse. 
659	"The passage alson states that Leonardo used knew how ""Mona Lisa"" felt when he was drawing her. At first he didn't know if she was smiling. But then he just let is go and began to draw. And now we are here, to the future and people wanting to knoww how another perosn feels by using a computer. "
660	Knowing that Venus is a whole planet the size of earth and only getting to see just a tiny bit of it is like starting at one side of the United States and then driving only a few hours to see how far you get, If you are trying to go all the way around the world to get back to the same spot but only have a few hours to do so, you don't cover much of anything to have any real say of how the world looks in different areas if you haven't seen it all yet. 
661	At least ever body is not doing with there class work. 
662	 Today you have the resource to learn from home, you should think about it, don not make mistakes that can affect your life in future. At least you have a special case. There are many solutions that can help you and you can triumph.      
663	""" So if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even a shack."" "
664	it can mess up study time. 
665	cause there are many people who depend on that college as a electoral support.  
666	It would make more sense if the states awarded both sides of the vote if it was a close win for one side or the other, but they would award the true winner with more votes than the narrow loser 
667	because due to the planets atmospher light doesn't peneatrate very well making it difficult to observe ground conditions. It also limits the amount that you would see in pictures and vidoes of the planet. Many researchers are working on new inventions so macheines will last longer on the harsh planet.  For example in the seventh paragraph NASA states that it has been working on electronics made of silicon carbon and they have even tested it a chamber concluding that it lasted in the harsh conditions for three weeks. They are also recyclaling old ideas from the 1800's, they are trying to use a computor that does calculations,but theinvention uses gears and levers, meaning that it doesn't require any electricity to work. 
668	council is a video game 
669	The folllowing details and information will be informing you exactly why scientists and theorists are having different opinions about the peculiar face. 
670	I think the answer will be: yes, the computer they can read students' emotional.  
671	We let danger and fear go, and let the power of adventure come through. 
672	Eveyone should have one of these or get an computer lie this one. If you really need to know about smeone you just would look on it to see what it is. 
673	Many years ago scientist believed that Venus use to have Oceans and Valleys.  
674	The Face on Mars was never an alien monument, even though many people just believed it was. It became famous for it, an once people found out the truth then weren't satified with it. 
675	The Astronomers think it's a good idea to kepp trying to land on Venus even though their spaceships never last more than a few hours and believe there might be various life forms like Earth and some oceans. 
676	Which would cause the student to get an even lower grade average! Unlike with an A or B student who would always at least try to complete their school work and homework. 
677	but that's not the question,the question was do I agree with it? No I don't. 
678	"All they do is tally up the popular vote, and say ""OK, im going to vote for Romney since that's what my people want.""  Why can't we just vote for who we want instead of wasting our time! The popular vote should be the only way to vote. There shouldn't be a long and hard process to voting. If I go and vote, I don't want to have to know like 60 different people to vote for, I just want to check the box saying that I want to vote for 'so and so' and leave and go home. It is ridiculous about having a whole process to voting. "
679	It a long time ago that a spacecraft discover Mars. there was a lot of things that the spacecraft found on Mars. Mars is a differnet planet away from here.  
680	It can be argued that the electoral  college method of selecting the president may turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state. Democrats in texas for example or republicans in california knowing their vote will have no effect they have less incentive to pay attention to the campaign that they would have if the president were picked by popular but of course no voters vote swings a national election and in spite of that about one half the elgible american population did vote in 2012 election. Voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election 
681	For my 3 reason they help select how many elector on how many state could have witch for ex the 23 amendment of the constitution they allowed columbia to have 3 
682	The best arguments in favor of the electoral college not being good are mostly assertions withiout much basis in reality. 
683	Do you think that the FACE was created by aliens ? Well i think the face is just a land form but thats how i feel about it 
684	"The text states  Luke joined the program is it was a once in a lifetime opporortunity. The text states,Luke said why would I pass this up this is anopporortunity of a lifetime. The text alo states, he said being a Seagoing Cowboy was much more than an adventure for him it opened up the world to him. Another thing Luke said is. ""It makes people moreof the other countries in need.  The text states,the cattle boat trip is an unbeliveable opportnity for a small town boy. The text also states,Luke said that awareness stayed with him leading his familly to host a numberofinternational students and exchange visitors for many years. The text also states,Luke found time to have fun on board, especially on the return trips after the animals had been unloaded. Another thing Luke said is he was so grateful for the opportunity.  The text states,Luke got to see all these different countries like china,and Europe. The text also states that Luke got to tour an excavated castle in Crete. Another thing that Luke said is sometimes you won't no when it will happen       "
685	Either way, this decision will affect how your students will have to manage their schedules after school hours. 
686	Not allowing students to use there phones at all 
687	Transportation or cars will always have an huge impact on the economy. Think about how many people use cars today. 
688	2) Everyone's President- The electoral College requires as presidential candidate 
689	To bring smile to your fae, while it's show just how much this computer can do. This mean the image on computer can make you happy,sad,smile and anger. It appers on your screen a similar ad might follow. 
690	when you ask for their opinion they probably want to ask you a question or they probably was thinking about the same question you asked but didnt have anyone to ask because they dont have friends either and now yall are friends and more friends are better than one.  
691	There are good benefits and bad benefits of not having a car. 
692	its is ever challenging visting, trying to do go and rescreach on a plant where you dont know anything about it. 
693	Even though no one knows whether or not if there was or life on Mars or if there still is. 
694	these are the reason why we should go to people vote for the president of the USA. 
695	To conclude my essay,we should not let any person win all votes and turn everything around for people. 
696	The Electoral College has five hundred thirty eight electors. Each state has an elector for each of the members in the House of Representatives. Not only does each candiddate running for president have their own group of electors, but you will get two of your own. 
697	""" It's 2016 and i still look young!"" said Luke. he was the cowboy who rode waves ""Ok dad since Forever ago!"" said his daughter. She was in town for special reasons.  "" Can you tell me a story of when you were young?"" his daughter asked. "" Oh all right,but just one. When I was young I was a wave surfer and-"" he was enturupted by his daughter. "" that part changes every time last time you told me this story it was a sailor and then it was a -"" ""Alright mabey I was just a guy on a cattle boat."" he said.  "" His daugter laughed at him, just a guy on a cattle boat,huh."" she said ""Hey it payed the bills, got food on the table,and payed the hospital bills too!"" he said angerly. His dauhter sat there with nothing to say. ""You promised to never talke about her ever again!"" not knowing what he said. she left the room with nothing to say.  She left the hous got in her car and drove off without a hug or a kiss goodbye. She never had done this before. She never knew her mother.  But of course she came back and he talked about his journeys to china and all different places. "
698	I think the technologhy to read students emotional spreeions is a great idea 
699	Then if the wrong person gets elected and he or does something no one likes everybody gone be mad cause they didnt for that to happen.  
700	he says that it is one of the hottest planets even though its not directly next to the sun the pressure holds the heat in, its hot enough to melt certain metals 
701	"In Paragraph 8, it states, ""Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also human curiousity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors. Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should expanded to meet the very deges of imagination and innovation.""         "
702	And so the dont spend time in the states because they know they have no chance in winning. And the state might pick a elector that they do not like by accident and mess up their vote. And the electors can only be people not holding public office. They might also choose a certain president because of his or her race.  And the thing is that the people do not choose the president the electors elect the president. Sometimes but it hardly ever happens, the elector chosen would change their vote to the other president. It depends on the state on who would most likely become president because the more people the bigger the vote will be. Also the electoral college method might turn of certain voters. And sometimes no candidate wins the majority vote and this causes pressure and makes it complicated to elect the president.    
703	 . One thing shows you that studing venus is worth it is that you travel and you will meet the vary edges of imagination and innovation, travels on earth and beyone should not be limited by danger and doubts . 
704	The founding fathers established it in the Constitution as a Compromise between election of the President by a vote for President and Vice Preident, and the counting of the electoral votes by Congress. Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the preident, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president.                   
705	Albert Einstein is known as one of the smartest people in the world. He created a robot, Frankenstein. Einstein blocked out others, used his own knowledge, got creative, and made history on his own. Helen Keller was born with the default of not being able to hear or to see. This was a tragedy, making it hard for Keller to walk and successfully know where she was going. Growing up with this issue she became extremely smart and used her problem, got creative, and began helping others by tutoring people who are deaf and blind. If students created their own projects it would give them an opportunity to come up with something incredible using what they, causing them to be creative, and generate ideas 
706	"The ""funny things"" about people is that laughing can be really contagest when you are down in the dirt, and your friend sees that you're just upset, they will do anything to mke you happy they will smile you, make a joke. just to see you smile "
707	 My overall reason is that it is not done professionaly like it should be. The same people should be running for president again especially the one who won before because he has another shot at winning again. That means that they change to many things. Like the school food and drinks the food is now healthy and the drinks are diet some kids and teachers have to have sugar or they will not do so good through out the day like if the have diebetes they might need some sugar well they wont get it because all the food is healthy and the drinks are diet now.  Those are the reasons why i dissagree.           
708	After reading this article, I have grown a nutreal side of this topic. The reason why is becuase I found a liking for the discovery, but there is also some things that I dislike as well 
709	the UNRRA hired''Seagoing Cowboys'' to take care of the horses,young cows,and mules that were shipped overseas. 
710	In a young persons life, they don't want to be lonely. They want to be more social and talk with friends, participate in an activity. All these things help students grow up more healthier in life. 
711	That doesnt mean the electoral college is bad, if it werent for them I think we the people are too stupid to make the decisons just ourselves. we need intellectual. Most voters dont even know much about who they pick. We shouldnt be trusted with all of the say in the election. 
712	The electorian collage is a very popular thing amonst states 
713	You just have to think about it, those characteristics are obvious. I mean yes, it was found in Mars, but that doesn't mean it couldn't have been a human. People just have to think more into the possible and not the impossible, because everything is possible.  
714	To begin with, the electoral college process consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for president abd vice president, and the counting of the electoral votes by congress. The electoral college consist of 538 electors. A majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the president. Each candidate running for presisent in your state has his or her own group of electors. The electors are generally chosen bt the candidate's political party 
715	Reason 4.) It allows freedom. Some kids are rebellious. So, when someone tells them something, they go against it 
716	"because ""each candidate has his or her own group of electors"", generally chosen by the candidate's political party,but state laws can vary that determine what or who the party consists of "
717	you still have to ask the students that are interested if this program will affect their grades in school.  I will help you organize this program.  I will also bring as many tutors as possible.  I will try to make this program successful.  Many other students and parents are going to help us organize this program.  This program is going to help educate many elementary school students and make a good future for them.  I will do my best to make those students successful. 
718	i mean ow could such a puniy creater make such a fuse over a interesting face. Aliens are not real!!  When Fred was rantting about how it had to be an alien and nothing else could have made thoose faces i was thinking that he might have gone crazy 
719	because the votes aren't really going to the votes to the congress, the votes really go to the slate of governers or the senate but the the senate or congress are really the real people that can choose the president or vice president.    
720	This just might help you to. I am almost sure that schools have to pay a phone bill, am i right? well by letting teens use their phones you can decrease the bill, or even better get rid of all the extra phones. 
721	For instance,you could find that playing football is your thing. With all the different activities there is no way you will not find the thing you like. 
722	Teens think it's cool when you drink and smoke and have to drive  Home if you are at a party and your friend drank too much and try to drive home Prevent it  Before she/he gets hurts and maybe die from a car crash.  
723	they think that if you take away this or you do that it will solve the problem. But it won't, it'll only make things worse and upset a lot of people. 
724	In America people use automobiles for evryday life. 
725	Okay hey,  I just wanted to introduce myself before we get into this subject my name is PROPER_NAME and i'm writing about changing the Electoral College to election by popular vote. 
726	I think it is very cool to go on other planets venus is sometimes closers to mars. The earth rotated its self and people dont nocited it.  The sun is the hottest planet in the solar system it is over 100's degrees. Long ago venus was probaly coverd largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life just like earth. 
727	"The author says that ""NASA's possible solution to the hostile condition on the surface of venus would allow scientist to float above the fray."" He is now explaining how they can make it suitable for people to go study venus. "
728	That statement or opinion is based on each individuals point of view. We dont all look at the choices in the same way. That is very important to try to undestand each choice and look at them closely. To be honest i think both have good ideas but election has a better outcome from my point of view. 
729	Imagine, voting in the upcoming election in vain knowing that organizations that only select the votes of one entire state, unconsious of the other millions individuals in the other surplus of the nation exist. The possibility of the one in fifty states choosing majorly one particular candidate, is highly risky for the goverment, and no one should permit putting in risk the goverment with this stubborn prefrence of electoral votes. Incontestably, the Electoral College System, is not a method of voting that should be unresposibly utilized to advantage the four years of presidency 
730	i wist we can help all the world for the little children can go to school they will me so happy ther dreem cambe real what day wish to du or gohave dome for demen that is all forme thank you.   
731	But it stems from the belief that a student's reasoning behind it are unacceptable 
732	Some school offer distance learning as an opinion for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. the students not focus in home sometime, for the TV, video games, and cell phones. The 20% the students, not go to school because is more difficult, but 80% the students go to school students don't benefit because have a distraction in home the TVs, are distraction or watching movies the students not focus in work in study some not doing a work or copies in internet . 
733	There Usually selected by the candidates political party , but state laws vary on how the electors are selected and what their responsibilities are. Your states certificates of Ascertainments are sent tot he Congress and the National Archives as part of the offcial records of the presidential election . After the presidential election , your governor prepares a ' Certificate of Ascertainment' listing all of the candidates who ranfor president in your state along with the names of their respective  electors . 
734	Nothing in life is fare or cheep and by only using popular votes is to cheat the candidates of the true experience of running for what they want. If you or me were to run for president I'm sure we would want to have the oppertunity to use the electoral college to our advantage. 
735	In paragraph six they state that¨Radar was a device on a hilltop that cost two hundred million dollars.¨  The last time I herd the United States was eight trillion dollars in debt, should we really consider adding two hundred million per radar to that eight trillion? 
736	Cell phones take up most of a students day and it does not benefit them at all. 
737	The teachers on video chat can be a random person off the streets and teach the student the wrong infomation 
738	But if you do pick to make kids do community service I will understand 
739	from going there he says it was very worthy of going we would just need a blimp like vehicle too hover over 30 miles above the land becuse the surface of venuse is very hot just in the blimp hovering over 30 miles would be 170 dagrees but where the blimp is sitting its at sae levels on earth. They are finding out ways too make electronics go onto venus because there is a lot of danger if we put a human on venus 170 dagrees is too hot for the human body unless they got the blimp at freezing tempatures the people inside will burn righht up blood will boil and people will get heat strokes. But if we put electronicson the planet that can survive the tempatures we might not have a problem with people being burned alive and we could actually exploer the lands of Venus we could make vheacles out of strong silicone for this mission it would be easier too make vehicle out of the stuff. 
740	Also the code can be kept for years, and would only need to to updated so we won't need to have multiple people tring to tell others how their facial expressions tells hows they are feeling. 
741	Obviously the president who has apppeared more times on television or at meetings will win. This method screams unfairness. Whichever candidate has more money and funding will obviously become more popular, even if their intentions as president arent as good as the qualities the other candidate's are. 
742	different knowledge 
743	By then we would be used to it so even bring the cars back that right there would keep making are air clean. 
744	I'm much happier this way said Heidrun Walter a media trainer and mother of two.  
745	"Astronomers believe venus to have been ""covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth."" According the the knowledge of the article ""the planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters"" stateting that Venus and Earth are and where once similar at a point in time "
746	China or the Pacific Ocean. You can get a chance to go to Greece and see wat it is like out there and get a chance to get out of the USA. 
747	the cost 
748	The Face on Mars looks just like a natural face. 
749	it might just be that all the spaceship they was using or the stuff on the ship making it not able to make it all the way up there they could be making the spaceship to havey or they need to study somewhere else first just to see if the ship the reason why the cant make it there and back. i think they should try a new ship or try to make it to somewhere else before trying to make it over there try somewhere closer so than maybe you find out how to get there or mybad get close to get to there that just how i see it if you say it worthy than try a diffent plant just to see if it easy to find out how to get to that plant you been talking about that why when u pull up all the reseach you can say as i was reach i find two way to get to the plant and they gone say how u find all of that to go with that and say when u find stuff you can get stuff from it. 
750	helps decide what to do. 
751	but I belive not because not one person has found an alien that was alive.  Aliens have been a myth for quite some time now and no one has really ever seen one. 
752	"If, in case of a tie, we due a tie braker as you will.  There will be a revotation process with 499 voters, these voters are picked at random in the city data base.  ""...for example, Obama recieved 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to only 51.3 percent of the popular votes cast for him."" "
753	these here are all the reasons i think community service would have a drastic affect on our community signed 
754	"Your home PC can't handle the complex algorithms used to decode Mona Lisa's smile. But we can write down some simple instructions that ""encode"" different emotions. Eckman has classified six basic emotions- happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness- and then associated each with characteristic movements of the facialc muscles. "
755	If Bush won because of the Electoral College and not individual votes why did the people even vote?  If noone were to vote then we would still have a president because, the Electoral College would just vote for who they wanted instead right? So why must America vote? 
756	People take classes the way online, some examples, a lot people taking that's way because some people are elder; but they things is better to graduate because he/she work and others things. Some people things that's is more better for then I things that's is great to do both side. People can helps another person or example some reason why he/her taking that's journey to graduate. Always one person in class is coming four or less days to schools the attends is so bad students things is better go to work that's why a lot students take that's route. Some students don't matter anythings about the school, however, students particularity not a lot both some person things bad. 
757	Well I hope You consider on taking this letter a help 
758	Taking aways the electoral college is like playing a game that have no obsticles nor opponents to challege you 
759	But if there was aliens On mare why would they just make one landform that looks like a face if there was aliens on mars im sure they wouldnt just make one that looks like a face and dont make anymore. They would make more and more till they got tired of making them 
760	"My quote from the story is ""Imagine being able to dectect exactly how other people are feelings, even when they are trying to hide their emotions.  Mona Lisa is in the picture, she 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry. At some schools there are some computers sofware that can recognize emotions but not all of them. Dr. Huang is terying to find better ways for humans and computers to communicate. they are suing alot of techology to find how are people emotions in the picture. I know when people lok at a picture people wanna know how are that person is feeling in that picture.  Dr. Huang is putting the computer constructs in 3D and trying to put 44 muscles in the model must move like human muscles. Eckman has classified six basic emotions like happiness, suprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. when your in a picture your going to have some type of face expression. It all depends on what type of face that the person in the picture is looking like. Even your mouth can depend if your face expression is good or bad by tighting your lips to show anger.  When your round people you can tell their face expression just by the look of their face. A lot of us would have trouble actually describing each facial trait that conveys happy. And their face expressions can depend on how their hair looks. If their hair looks all over the place its probably bad and if their hair looks all nice its probably happy. "
761	you would have to vote for a slate if you want to vote for john kerry. not always do the voters control whom their electors vote for. seventeen states didnt see the candidates at all,including rhode island and south carolina. but each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee. in a state creates a landslide electoral-vote victory in that state.  the popular vote was really close in florida in 2012.    
762	I'm writing this letter to you Mr. Senator to explain the good and bad effects the Electoral College has.  
763	If so many teenagers would just pay attention to what's going on around them they would understand what's going on in the world. 
764	There was a Gallup poll in 2000 that even states that 60% of the population of voters prefered a direct election instead of using the electoral college. That year, Al Gore won the popular vote, but, thanks to the electoral college, he lost the presidency. 
765	What I found out that is also not fair is to the citizens and state who vote, is that the winning candiate's share his share of popular vote with the Electoral College. 
766	But on april 5,1998 when mars global surveyor cydonia for the first time they shot photos of the pictures and they showed them.But they also investing in those pictures and rerally seen where they came from.But most people where not happy because the face of mars was located 41 degrees north martian latitude where it was winter in april 1996.But nevertheless on April 8, 2001 a cloudless summer day in cydona and it was 25 degrees to center the face of mars 
767	According to the machine if you frown at it, the next ad will be different. 
768	Most people may not like who are next president is gonna be but all just have to deal with it because we all cant go back and pick who we wont to be president. 
769	"Dr. Huang also stated that most human communication is nonverbal,including emotional communication. Dr. Huang also gave some examples of what movments to do in front of a mirror. For example raise your lips at the corners of your mouth. second squint your eyes slightly,to produce wrinkling (""crow's-feet"") at the corners of your eyes. Holding that, raise the outer parts of your cheeks up,toward your eyes.  "
770	"Well first if i go back to paragraph 3 Nasa states that they thought from sending the pictures to the pubic it be a good way to atract public attention to fund mar's missions.  ""The face"" became very popular when Nasa first sent it to the public. Also on paragraph 7 the author states that when the Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia ,they found out that ""the face"" was just a regular natural landform. In the year of 2001 the Mars Global Surveyor was able to snap a picture of the landform, as said by Garvin  ""the picture actually showed the Martian equivalent of a buttle or mesa- landforms common around the American West"" "
771	an advantage of the Electoral College is also that the winning presidential candidate is awarded all of the electors in most states, except Maine and Nebraska, stated in the seventh paragraph. 
772	"The process of Electoral College voting consists of the selection of the electors (the people who actually get to decide on the vote casted.) Under the 23rd Amendment of the Constitution the District of Columbia is treated like a state, and is ""allocated 3 electors"" for the purpose of voting "
773	we need to appreciate what the humankind has given us and use it. 
774	But if it's serious than they could go to the office and ask them if they could leave but it wouldn't be ok with the office because your parent has to be at the school to sign you out for example yesterday my mom came to school to pick me up early for an emergency so she had to go in the office to tell them that i am here to pick up my kid.      
775	instead, we have a system where each person votes on a candidate to represent their state in the election. 
776	im not sayin u a bad princical and u or considering to make a chang that's good all the studets should that fun activits and stuff like that because they come to school and that we try to make a chang and that we truy to good on the test i try to do my best. 
777	What it really is, is a natural landform that our viking took a picture of on one side of mars. 
778	A process that seems meaningless, a process that is uncalled for. 
779	"the university of amsterdam, Dr. huang and his colleague are experts at developing better ways for human and copmputers to communicatre. a computer recognize the subtle facial movements we human use to express we feel. the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the the face, all 44 major musclues in the model must move like human muscles.  the new emotion, recognition softwere track these facial movements in a real face or in the painted face of Mona Lisa, the different unit, thte softwere can even identify mixed emotion, each expression is compared against a neutral face showing no emotion. the humans perform this same impressive every day. for instance, we can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face. us would have trouble actually describing each facial trait that conveys happy, worried, that artist such as da vici studied human anatomy to help them paint facial muscles precisely enough to convey specific emotion.  his new computer softwere stores similar anatomical information as electronic code. perharps Dr. huang emotion algorrithmms are different sort of ""Da Vinc code"" the Mona Lisa demonstration is really internded to bring a smile to thet're face, while it shows just how much this computer can do. a computer that knows when they're happy or sad. if they're smile when a web ad appears on they're screen, a simily ad might follow, but if they're frown, the next ad will be different.  a classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored, then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor. the same technology can make conputer animated faces more expressive for video games or video surgery. most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication, note Dr. huang, so computer need to undersatand that tooooo.  had his actor carefully reproduce smiling and frowning as a way of creating these emotion on stage. feeling someone else's emotion state, may happen because they're unconsciously imitate another person's facial expression. whoever thought that making faces could reveal so much about the science of emotion "
780	So for example, say that Californa gets 45 electoral votes and then Columbia has the same amount of voters vote for the president they want they will only gte about 5 to 8 because of the state size. Once again restating that we need to vote for we want to and have everyone's vote coung not just the votes added up and then shrunk to electoral votes 
781	At some point a studnets can feel pressered after a class of even before there next class. These emotion have the accursy to not be the same during a students day. Calculating these emotion, can not be like working on a math problem. Emotions can change in the matter of a second. You just dont know what can happen at any minute that changes your expressions. 
782	it helps read kids mind whenthere upset and not happy 
783	it is easier to elect a president then having to go through a process of sending in votes by hand 
784	The Mona Lisa demonstration is really intended to bring a smile to your face, while it shows just how much this computer can do. Imagine a computer that knows when youre happy or sad. For example, if you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be different. A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored, Dr. Huang predicts. Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor. The same technology can make computer-animated faces more expressive for video games or video surgery. Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication, notes Dr. Huang. So computers need to understand that, too.  
785	The video conferencing you need to pay for a classes, in work some students have a job, and pay school. 
786	Imagine all the wonderful things you can learn about congress and you can have your own personal experience. The electoral College consists of 538 electors. A majority of 270 electoral votes is requried to elect the President. Your state's entitled allotment of electors equals the number of members in the Congressional delegation: one for each memeber in the House of Representatives plus two for your Senators. Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for aslate of electors, who in turn elect the president. If you live in Taxas, fpr instance, and wanted to vote for John Kerry, you'd vote for a slate of 34 Democatic electors pludges to Mr. Kerry. 
787	Never making it just a job. Its work that is always worth it in the long run. Never give up and never bale out on something. 
788	if that time students have online classes students doing homework and project,assessment at hospital and at home. Students sitting in the hospital they are boring if students have some attend class they are doing some online classes. And they students have time going to fast. Students attend classes finish they doing some plan. But, students doesn't to make plant January is to rarely to know this information because, students plan after depend school on there teacher and consular. And summer , winter vacation too and there plane my be change. So, students,would benefit from being able to attend classes from at home. 
789	"""The Electoral College consists of 538 electors. A majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the President"" (paragraph 3) "
790	4 reason is that each state has his or her on elector. 
791	but it is stil amazing because they wont have to do much just snap a picture and thee program will caulculate it think about how many crimes this will solve . 
792	No one uses it anymore. Due to it being completely unfair to citizens and states alike.  
793	I think if people do it online or at home they are not going to make friends. Sometimes is good to make friends because they can help you or be with you in someway is good to go school then taking at home or online. Also if they do it online or at home they are going to be more prepared and ready for wet ever situation because they was putting attention in their lessons. But being in a group in school is more interesting because you can meet new people and don't be alone doing the work but everything have their good choices for do it and people can decide how they want to do it or how much they want lo learn. 
794	The painting Vinci did was only one of the thing he did he mad more thing in the pass but the whole world knowes him for this one pating he ,ad and everyone from king to people like me and you come and see it 
795	because that if we let it keep on going then is will not be fair to anyone at all. And it also not fair for a winner tom take all.            
796	scientist should keep studing venus. 
797	Conclusion states that people have beautful everything around them! Not to mention, while looking in the mirrow process can make you a good pro at expressing your emtions. secdonly, muscles it's an expert, faces don't lie. These muscles clues are somtimes used to spot when smiling. Politiian or celebritu isn't being truthful. 
798	Say if the technology in the car was damaged and the car started to not act properly. That would probably cost thousands of dollars to repair. Also if the car was to not function correctly the driver, passengers, or other people outside of the vehicle may be injured. That is the first disadvantage of the driverless car. 
799	 1 the author is trying to explain how does this works,to help the people of the town and especially that if you vote that means that you are helping to the elctors and that probaly wil not help if you dont choose the correct person.       
800	It's official: The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. THe best arguments in favor of it are mostly assertions without much basis in reality. And the argument in favor of it are mostly assertions without much basis in reality. And the arguments against direct elsections are spurious at best. It's hard to say this, but Bob Dole was right: Abolsih the electoral college! 
801	NASA won't even leak anything. Some people think that Face is bona fide and that shows there are aliens on Mars. Nobody knows is that is true because if you read the paragraph it says some people think and everyone is believing what people think. 
802	"Voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference rather than poeple who thing that single vote may decide an election"" (Posner, Paragraph 23). "
803	I remember when we walked there I was playing with my plastic bag and I popped it. I figured out how to fix it by tying it. It wasn't a big rip so I could tie a knot by it to close it up. I certainly had better field trips but it was alright. I hope you use this idea for your school. At a public school I'm not sure how well this will turn out.  
804	Days later NASA let the picture out for the world to see. The picture went viral within days. This had become one of the most famous talked about things in the world. It appeared in books, magazines, radio talks, shows, etc. 
805	"The article states that ""The facial expressions for each emotion are universal,"" observes Dr. Huang, ""even though individuals often show carying degrees of expression"" (Paragraph 4). This is saying that sometimes people don't put much effort into emotions like for instance smiling, sometimes people don't smile as broadly as they would like to. "
806	the electoral college is the most lamest thing 
807	"The candidate's get to choose people who will vote for the person who picked them just bc they picked them. They probbaly dont have good reasons on the they pick that candidate they just pick him/her because they picked that person. They candidate who did win the election their electorial voters get a przie just for helping them win the election. And the others well they get nothing. It's not fair to the other people who voted for their apponite. All they get is a ""Thanks for voting"". Presidents voters get a cerification for helping them when. It's not fair to everyone else "
808	If scientist actually proved aliens are real I'm sure they won't tell the public. 
809	"The electoral college is not a place in united states. It is a process that the founing fathers made a long time ago. When they where first making the congress. It is a election of the presient by popular vote of the people in the united states.  The Electoral college is a process. That consists of people that are in congress that help vote for the Presient and Vice President.  The Electoral college consists of 538 elector, But there must be a majority of the 270 electoral votes to elect the next President. Your state's entitle allotment of electors equal to the members in the congress at a time. There most be one house of representetives plus there most be two senators in each states. In congress to make the vote go though.  Under the 23rd Amendment of the constitution, the District of Columbia is allocate  3 electors. They are treated like they are a state that is in the united states, But most people just call them District of columbia.  Each state has a candidate that running for president in there state. The electors are generally chosen by the candidate's political party, but there a lot of states that are not like that and the vote on who they believe in. Who they think that is going to do the best job as president.  The president election is held every four years. no president can be president more then twice, but there was one person had more then two but that was a thing that happend because there was a war going on.  The presiential election is held every four years on the first tuesday after the first monday on November. you help choose the next president of the united state. but only if you are 18 you can not vote before you are 18.  Most states have a ""winner-take-all"" system that awards alll electors to the winning presient candidate. However, maine and nedraska each have a variation of  "" proportional representation. ""  After the president election, your governor prepares a ""certificate of ascertainment"" listing all of the candidates who ran for president in your along with the names of their respective electors. the certificate of ascertianment also declares the winner of the president election that in there state at the meeting of the electors in december of the election year. your state's certificates of ascertainments are sent to the congress an the national archives as a part of the official records of the presiential election.                                                                                                                            "
810	For example, lets say two people are running too be president of the United States. People vote and everything but then its up too the 538 electors. Then the 538 electors choose who they want as their president, 270 electoral votes is required to elect the President, as weeks go by, the new President is one of the two people that ran too be President was elected. Some people are happy and some people are mad because they put their vote in and they voted on the other person but that other person won and now they are angry.

813	 Like On paragragh 18 the same thing happen with obama and romney to . obama received 61.7% for the elector vote compared to only51.3%.so the electoral collage should not be a constitution 
814	Luke Bomberger was just an ordanery small town boy untill his friend ofered a jod as a seagoing cowboy. When he was thinking about it he said to him self that it would be a wonderfull oprtunet and just couldn't say no. He told his friend that he would take the jod.  When Luke truned 18 thay could have drafted him over to the army but they didn't. Luke claims in the article that he was ment for the job becues he was rased on his aunt's farm. Yet he was not ready for the sea.  Luke said he saw some pritty cool stuff. Thay also had some fun on the ship when the anamals were out. When Luke came home his aunt was probuly rilly thankfull that he came back ok.  He probuly was thankfull that he got to come home becoues the other seagoing cowboys didn't do as much seagoing as him. Luke said going over seas let him be more aware for people and there needs, thats what lead him to latter on hosting international students in his home for many years.

819	" To begin with under the 23rd amendment of the constitution ,""The District of Columbia is allocated 3 electors and treated like a state for purposes of the electoral college"" and for that saying , in the  following discussion , the  word state also refers to the district of columbia. Also Each and every candidate that is running for president in your state has his or her own group of electors.""The electors are generally chosen by the candidate's political party , but state laws vary on how the electors are selected and what their responsibilities are.""  Foremost , under the electoral college system , voters vote not for the persident , but for a slate of electors , who in turn elect the president.""Who are the electors? They can be anyone not holding public office. Who picks the electors in the  first place? it depends on the state. Now i understand sometimes at state conventions , Partys , central committee , sometimes the presidental candidates themselves , Also sometimes get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate.""The single best argument against the electoral college is what we might call the electoral college is what we might call the  disaster factor. Its Basically whenever theres a  really good argument thats what its called.  Subconstantquintly , Sometimes most people worry about the prospect of a tie in the elections vote. ""In That case , the election would be thrown to the house of representatives , where state delegations vote on the president."" At the most basic level , the electoral college is unfair to voters. ""because of the winner-take-all system in each state , candidates dont spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning , focusing only on the tight races in the ""swing"" states. Then now its official "" The electoral college is unfair , outdated , and irrational."" The best arguments in favor of it in favor of it are mostly assertions without much basis in reality.  "

830	It's the electors that elect the president not the people. When your voting for a presidential candidate you're actually voting for a slate of electors. Each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee

832	Most of the residents in Germany have given up their cars.  Vauban's streets are completely ''car-free'', this means that no one except for the main thoroughfare and a few streets on one edge of the community have cars. This movement is called ''smart planning.''  This movement helps the greenhouse gas emissions in Erope. Passenger cars are reponsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe, and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States, this evidence is given in paragraph 5.  David Goldberg states on paragraph 7 that all the development since the World War II has been centered on cars, he is promoting new communities that are less dependent on cars.  In source 2 the autor talks about one of the biggest advantages of limiting car usage, by cleaning the air from pollution. Cold nights ans warm days cased the warmer layer of air to trap car emissions. In Bogota, Colombia they are doing a program that is called ''Car-free'' this is a program that allows people to have a day without using their cars, in souce 3 
833	Luke Bomberger used to be an average teenager working two part-time jobs. Then his friend, Don Reist, came and asked him if he wanted to be a 'Seagoing Cowboy', or one who helps bring livestock to war victims in Europe. Luke then took this as an opportunity of a lifetime and couldn't resist.  The Seagoing Cowboys are a group of people who take care of livestock that were being shipped overseas to help the many that were devastated by the war in Europe. This livestock included young cows, horses, and mules. Shortly after Don and Luke found out about the Seagoing Cowboys, they then both signed up. LIttle did Luke and Don know, this job had a lot of risks.  The Seagoing Cowboys were a great part of an even greater orginization, the UNRRA, or the United Nations Relief and Rehibilitation Adminisrtation. This orginization was made up of 44 nations. This orginization also helped relieve and rehibilltate the devastated families of Europe. Luke knew what he was doing was a great cause, but did he know that going across the Atlantic and the Pacific oceans was a very risky thing. Luke could have had second thoughts about the risks that he was taking, but he wasn't doing it for himself, he was doing it for the people that needed his help.   
834	Although an Electoral College can cost a lot of money to build they are still worth it. The bulding of the college will also be beneficial because it causes more jobas for the unemployed. Electoral Colleges are fundamental and will help improve the state's current voting system. 
835	Run-Off elections should be avoided, it would greatly complicate the presidential election process.  
836	I still don't believe that can ever happen because we express how we feel we can't count our emotions. 
837	The author say's that Venus has no value because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors .

840	Some schools are requiring students to do a summer projects to assure that they are learning during their break. Do you think that this project should be designed by the teachers or students? 
841	"""Long ago, venus was probaly coverd in large oceans and could have supported varouis forms of life, just like earth today"". The planet has a surface temperature of 800 degrees farien height. Also the planet has a much higher atmospheric pressure at over 90 times greater than Earth. "
842	Some people disagree though they think that we should stick with the electoral college. They think its a good way to do the voting because they get to choose the electors who will choose our president. 
843	Can you imagine a computer guessing everyones emotions, and tell wether their sad, happy, confused, etc. Well a 3-D computer can model all 44 major muscles. 
844	but that's not the point 
845	That doesn't mean it was created by aliens and besides, we didn't find no ancient civilization on Mars 
846	This is what I think and what people should do about cars and phones the true ones would understand this message thank you so much for taking your time to read till again bye.   
847	This device would also be helpful there because it tells you about the muscles that move to show a certain emotion. 'For example, your frontalis pars lateralis muscle (above your eyes) raises your eyebrows when surprised...' (D'Alto paragraph 3); students can study their muscles that make their emotions by learning about these muscles.  
848	The argument that isn't even factual.  You are going off of a guess in your mind. 
849	One reason why it would be good is to see if the person is just not happy at all then you could talk to them and see whats going on with them. So you can see if you can fix it. Another reason why i think its a good thing is because it tell the peron your doing it to and you how there expressions are. I also fill like this could be a good thing because if the person is going threw a hard point in their life then this would be good. The reson why this could be good is because then you could help them out before they do anything to them self. another thing that this would be good for is if you r going to go do something and the other person has a expression on there face you cant tell how they feel about it then yoiu can use this technology to see if it bothers them or not. There was a claim in the story that they figured how the person felt before doing something. 
850	Sometimes they need help so you should get involved and help out every once in awhile. 
851	This indicate that anything could happen if we touch one of those planets. He addresses the speed in the planets when it orbits the sun. Anything can go wrong if its always going like that. Its like having something spinning around everyday. Eventually, something is gonna go wrong and its gonna mess everything up. On the other hand, People who study space would know the answer to what will happen if they was to touch. The author basically wants others to care about the world. He wants others to see both parts of the world. It doesnt matter if something is bad you should still have respect and love in it because its here for a reason 
852	how know what could be on the planet. If we do we should be real cafeul because there could be dangerous stuff there. Its an opertunaity to see what Venus good values are. We can also compare earth o venus. 
853	according to sports news website on collage sports, suggests that 25% of sports players in collage sports that train hard and keep lead to building skills that could help down the road and the other 75% of collage players that dont train hard and just sit around learn how to succed through failer. This means that the collage students that try their best are the one mostly building skills that will help them succed and the other 75% who dont try learn skills through not putting more work into it knowing what they need to try to improve on to become better. 
854	But some students only do it like once or twice like me but other they will just have it out all the time in every class and not pay attention. So that just makes them fail and have to redo everything all over. 
855	In closer I thing that asking for multiple opinions is good become. You would see what they would do, if they are all good pople they will have your best in mind,and You will get multiple ways to do what you need to do 
856	"The residents of the other regions are likely to feel disenfranchised- to feel that votes do not count, that the new president will have no regard for their interests, that he really isn't their president.""this quote from source 3 explains that without the Electoral College their vote won't count and that the new president won't have any of their interests. To end this, if we didn't have the Electoral College no one's vote would count "
857	I am against this because I belive it would create many arguments and I belive we are not ready for this yet. 
858	"The easiest way to prove that the electoral college must go, is to reveal the facts. In source 2: The Indefensible Electoral College it states ""over sixty percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now"". Multiple icons such as Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and the AFL-CIO have stated they would like to abolish the electoral college as well! "
859	The Electoral has its flaws but so does the popluar vote.

862	""" The authors reasoned it would be a good way to engage the public and attract attention to Mars. The ""Face on Mars"" has since become a pop icon. It has starred in a Hollywood film, appeared in books, magazines, radio talk shows, even haunted grocery store chechout lines for 25 years! But not everyone was satisfied.  The Face on Mars is located as 41 degrees north martian latitude where it was winter in April '98, a cloudy time of year on the Red Planet. Mission controllers prepared to look again. ""It's not easy to target Cydonia,"" says Garvin. ""In fac, it's hard work.  "" Mars Global Surveyor is mapping spacecraft that normally looks straight down and scans the planet like a fax machine in narrow 2.5 km-wide strips. ""We just don't pass over the Face very often,"" he noted.  What the picture actually shows in the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa-landforms common aroud the America West. ""It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River PLain of Idaho,"" says Garvin.  ""That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same heigh as the Face on Mars."" "
863	"Evening star""is what they call Venus. The nickname gaive the rung idea of Venus. Peolpe where misstaking that Venus is a star. Venus it's a own plant.

864	Mona Lisa don't smile often, but the computer can make her face smile by using the imagery. Facial impression and movements are not just for communicating it can also be in while looking at someone or reading a books.

866	"Requiring ""massive upgardes to existing roads, something that is simply to expensive to be practical."" "
867	It really makes time fly by so much quicker . I've beenn doing this for what now,2years? And i've already been on 9 trips! Though sitseeing is not the only thing we do we trasport animals to country's in need . So far it's been a huge success and we don't want to look back, not yet. 
868	The electon could have a bias opinion and go against what the people want 
869	The Mona Lisa is very famous and many people know about it. And learning more about it would be great thing for the kids in the classroom 
870	The test is saying even though Mercury is the closet planet to the sun Venus has the highest preasure and heat and Benusin geology and weather presents additional impendiments like valcanos, earthquakes, and freguent lighting so it? hard for scienetist to land rockests on Venus. 
871	the electoral collage is a process that helps use vote for the preaident and vice president. and they count the electores votes and it is desited by congress. 
872	So that's why i think its important school before sports. and have an A or B for grades so you can do sports 
873	Dispite the electoral college method voting is still possible. 
874	The author is worthy os studying venus because venus is a planet were there could mostlikly have human on the planet 
875	People who think the face is just a natural landform probably think the people that believe aliens made it are crazy. 
876	If you where in school and would have to do the work the next day after you feel better. 
877	Most students these days don't help out enough or anything and they need to learn how to help up the community so when they get older they can volunteer to do something like help the community out. I am a student and i think they should make kids to community service not just by kids volunteering i think they should make everyone do it and not by getting in trouble by the cops neither. 
878	"I want to believe that there is life on Mars, but the thing is that Mars ""probably"" have alien's there. As no one has thought about it, alien's could be legit. Just because we see a face on Mars means one thing, but the fact that it's whole entire bottom half of it's neck-to-bottom part is gone. Just because it changed up doesn't mean,""Oh, it must have cleared up since it's been there for a while"". I doubt that because, no human being can walk on Mars with no protection on that can keep him/her alive. If your going to Mars, make sure you need a quite bit of protection. But, if you actually do see an alien, just run, because it's best staying alive instead of wind up dead in the middle of no were on Mars. "
879	But these speculaters dont understand that they are choosing the president and the electors before the vote of the president. 
880	"Riches on earth mean nothing. Moth, famine, and thieves destroy here. But riches in heaven is what matters. This country would never even have became independent if it was run by the people who are running it now. First of all this country was founded on God and now the government wont even allow us to have a Christmas party in schools because the word CHRIST is in it. They want us to have a ""holiday"" party instead. they will all see one day. On judgment day. All we can do is pray for them because thats all that can help these distranged men. Love Joy Peace Patience Kindness Goodness Faithfullness Gentleness and Self-control ol ol. Love joy peace patience kindness goodness faithfulness gentleness and self-contol o ol. "
881	The 'Face on Mars' was found by us NASA, in 1976. It got very popular over the years then. 
882	This story is about evaluating The Challenge of Exploring Venus. In the first paragraph it is kinda misleading because it says that venus sometimes called the evening star is one of the brightest points of light in the night sky. Then it goes on to talk about how venus is also a planet so the name is very misleading. Then paragraph two it talks about how its a planet again not a star and its saying that its the closest planet to earth.  
883	Venus is the closest plant to earth in terms of density, size, and in distance. Earth, Mars, and Venus all are planetary neighbors. Something Earth is closter to Mars or we are closer to Venus, it just depends on the different speed. Venus is sometimes around the corner, in space terms. We, humans, have sent plenty of spacecrafts to land on cloud-draped world. But none of the spacecrafts have survived the landing less than a day. We havent had a single spaceship land down on Venus in more three decades. 
884	I cant say we would not take advantage of this priviledge cause some people will. 
885	Televison and movies have been fasinated by cars that could drive their selves. 
886	Second Venus is called the earth twins. why do you ask? Earth in terms of density and size and occasionally the closet in distance too. 
887	Studying venus is a amazing purduit because no human could not live in venus or go up to venus because its far away from earth and we haven't made a spaceship that could reach all the way up in venus because it could never make it 
888	It is a great picture off landform you might never see again, but it has nothing to do with aliens on Mars. If aliens were real, one of  NASA'S scientists would have found them in outer space by now 
889	Policy two you cant even use the phone at all. I think each school that's thinking of having phones should do a vote with the parents and students, and have students write an essay on why they should have phones and if twenty out of one hundred students have a convincing essay about phones then they should be able to have there phones during lunch and passing periods. 
890	"""Face on Mars could'nt of possibly been evidence of life on mars because, why would there be a face but no body to go along with it "
891	my third reasons:They should make classes work online only for the kids.  
892	The electoral college is described in many ways. It is described as needed, useful and helpful 
893	but it would be good for them to learn their consequences. 
894	But if they never know the feeling of accomplishment when it comes to that. 
895	I agree we should clean up the entry school in end up clean like a whistle 
896	because the Face on Mars looks just like a natural face 
897	Are these cars going to run on gas or electricity? Either way, these cars not start. A car stalls all the time, but those cars we handle, but what about cars that are driverless? 
898	The author supports this idea by giving information how its different from today then on the 1940s. 
899	The number of electoral votes given to each state is bad because there can be a lot of the same numbers and an example is, Texas has 38 votes and North Dakota, South Dakota, and Montana all of 3 votes. Each party has to have trusted electors because too me, if each party has trusted electors, then maybe a lot of the votes won't be the same. 
900	the computer can recognize the subtle facial movments we human's have to express hoe we feel. 
901	I think that the  Electoral college should omly have one elector. 
902	Much like taking this test we are waisting our time. We are endowed by our creator certain unalianable rights that cannot be taken away. There is a lot wrong about our government and elecoral college doesnt strike the surface. It is foolish to think electoral college is the biggest problem america has. Not just america but the world. The world is falling apart and all these hypocritical media people are freaking out over the electoral college. 
903	"In the article ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"", it tals about how scientest are working on new technology to overcome the chalanges of Venus and its complications. "
904	We are all one so we should all vote and choose who we would like as a President of the United State.                   
905	I admit the congress does know alot 
906	"The idea of these ""Driveless Cars"" does sound intersting and at the most fascinating. But however i'm going to say i'm all that for that particular idea for a few reasons "
907	Then,Your home PC can't hanlde the complex algotithms used to decode Mona Lisa's smile. 
908	This is very important, as we all want a good leader who will support our home state. If, for example, the Electoral College voted on a Democrat, and he won, Florida may not have much hope. Florida is a Republic state, as is most of the southern states; yes, Mr. President would be obligated to help all 50 states when necessary, but the bigger benefits would go towards the Democratic states, and probably his home state 
909	Many my agrue that, the Electoral college is there for our benefit. 
910	"but in the second article it says ""Because of the winner-take-all system in EACH state"".  "
911	advantages of limiting car usage 
912	I have done lots of reaserch, and revealed a natural landform. 
913	Another way to stay involved with your school is to work on the yearbook. 
914	The founding father that discovered Electoral College made it easy for anybody to be president. 
915	So yeah, I dont really know how to feel. There's bad good way this thing couls affect the world. But there's pro and cons to everything I guess. 
916	This artical explains what electoral colleges are, how they help voting, and how they are bad. These three things give the reader the opion about this artical. 
917	Since the voter are not voting directly for their candidate of choise, I personaly dont think this is the best way to go. The popula elections provide a better way of voting for president. Since it means that the people that vote a voating directly to the candidarte and not the electors. 
918	aliens probably wanted it to be like that 
919	This article is abaut the platent of venus that are sometimes called Evening Star this is the secon planet from our sun,this planet is one that tje people can see from a large distance it has proved a very challenging place to examine more closely. this is the most dangerous for the people because the sun is like the fire the people can`t see and touch this in a short distance the sun and they light can be beautiful but is it most thing that is dangerous in the universe. 
920	''under the electoral college systems voters vote not for the president but for a slate of electors who in turn elect the president if you lived in texas for instance and wanted to vote for john kerry youd vote for a slate of 34 democratic electors pledged to kerry on the off chance that those electors won the statewide.  the electoral college is widely regarded as an anachronism a non-democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be overruled by declaring the canidxent who recevies the most popular votes the winner the advocates of this potion.  a dispute over the outcome opf an electoral college vote is pooible it happend in 2000 but its less likely than a dispute over the popular vote the reasons is that the winning candidtes share of the electoral invaribly exceeds his share of the popular vote in election for example obama receievd 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to only 51.3 percent of the popular votes.  cause most of the states awared electoral votes on a winner take basis even a very slight pluerality in a state landslide victory in that state a tie in the national nationwide vote is possible cause then total number of votes 538 is an even number but is highly likely.    
921	that will work to he mite do it and he mite not any way you tried to get him to change his mind 
922	,but, it is not a good idea 
923	"Lastly, this goes for the same as drinking and driving. Any alcohol consumed inside your body will greatly be affected in your driving ability. The Alcohol Rehab Guide claimed that, you'll have a ""slow reaction time, lack of coordination, reduce concentration, decrease vision, and inhibit judgment."" These are ways alcohol influences you, and your driving capabilities. "
924	Well each candidate running for president in your state has his or her own group of electors. for example, the electors are generally choosend by the candidate political party, but state laws vary on how the electors selected. and did you know that when u vote for president you help choose a elector because when u vote for them u voteing for your candidate electors. 
925	"The Electoral College is unfair, outdated, and irration. Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president. The electoral college is unfair to voters, because of the winner-take-all system in each state. Candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the ""swing"" states. Over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now. And yet, the electoral college still has its defenders. "
926	tudents will receive a good grade if they participate in this community because is like an extra credit. 
927	because the only way that I would do that one is if all of the kids in the school get on there phones in the middle of class and just stay on it for the whole time without doing anything else without even paying attention to anyone or anything else. But policy one is more understanding because it is getting phones out of the way while they are working but not while they are on there free time because phones shouldn't bother anyone if its on there free spare time 
928	people get to pick who they want by why pick it if you dont pick he most popular vote ,because what if we dont like what you pick ? 
929	they could make life long friends that have the same interest. 
930	Most people don't understand the use of the Electoral College. I think that there should be someone going out to jobs and schools talking to the the new generation and the people with jobs about this Electoral College. 
931	in other cases itthe presidential canidates have  more intrest in the bigger states such as Florida. that could boost in the jobs, and advanteges in the bigger states. 
932	Long hours of your eyes being exposed to the screen could lead to temporary loss of sight witch is never good. Also, headaches occur when most people are on the phone to much long hours often affect the ears witch leads to more problems occurring then normal. Scientist have shown that the more time we spend on our phones the more time are bodies are being affected. Things like slouching or leaning could lead to permit neck issues and back sprains. 
933	The electoral college doesn't only have a few minor set backs, but it could tarnish out dreams of who we wanted to be president by way more than we could've expected. 
934	but not all students 
935	I closed this section by saying that all computers and scentist can't recongize everybody emotion because everybody is different and experience different test on there emotion 
936	hey guys this is tyler, i'm a reporter, 
937	like when vice president richard nixon.  who was presiding over the seanate validated only his opponents elelcectors thats not right or fair he made sure to do so with out establishing a precedent what if it happens again the nations doseant need that . 
938	There is also a possibility that we wouldnt have to go completely without cars. We could go to electric or just find a totally different resource to run a car. I am sure there has to be something else than just gas that could run a car. It amazes me how we make all these crazy futuristic inventions but we cant make another substance to run a car. I think we should stop worrying about just stopping car usage completely and try to make something else that will run a car.

940	"In America, we use vehicles on a daily basis to get around.  You either drive a vehicle that you own, ride a bus, take a taxi, ride a bike, or walk.  It is rare to see someone walking or riding a bike these days, but that is because we are so dependant on motor vehicles.  If you take a look at other countries, you will realize that they are taking steps to cut back on the use of motor vehicles to help stop pollution.  It is uncommon in the U.S. for a whole town of people to ""give up"" their cars, let alone pay $40,000 for a parking space and a house.  In Vauban,Germany, this ""smart planning"" movement was introduced to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions and the amount of cars in the area.  ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,"" said Heidrun Walter, a mother of two and media trainer.  70 percent of families living in Vauban do not own cars and walk or ride bikes to reach their destinations.  The town is not completely ""car free,"" there is a main thoroughfare that runs from downtown Freiburg.  Considering the town was only built about ten years ago, they are helping our environment in a big way.  Smog is a big problem in Paris,France.  After several days of ""near-record pollution,"" Paris temporarily baned driving to clear the cities air.  About 4,000 drivers recieved a 22-euro fine and 27 of those drivers had their cars impounded because of their reaction to their fine.  The fine worked and the cities congestion was down to 60 percent after five days of the smog.  The cities weather was part of the reason why there was so much smog, but some people believed it had to do with the diesel fuel that was used throughout France.  The public transit was free from Friday to Monday, but the smog eventually cleared and the band was lifted.           "

971	well scientist come to notice that venus has some familiar featurs alike earth it has vallys, mountains,and craters, scientist have come to think that long time ago, venus was probably coverd with oceans and could have suppoted various forms of life, just like earth today., thats why scientists are not giving up on figuring out venus witch is why they are still trying to go back to venus safe and scientificly productive following the safe orders that NASA gave the scientist, NASA gave sicentist permission to go to venus with some conditions,they will only be allowed to be floating above the fry, scientist will have to invent a stronger space ship, and they will have to study not just the planet but the people more so it can be safer and they dont have any risks. not to mention venusis the closest to earth in terms of desity and size, and occasionatly the closest to didtance too its the second planet from our sun known as erths twin.

""Not a single spaceship has touched down on Venus in more than three decades."" "" A thick natmosphere of almost 97% carbon dioxide blankets Venus.""  The suface of venus is over 800 degress, that is 90 times greater than what we experience on Earth. These conditions on Venus are far more extreme. Venus conditions also beat submarines divinging into the deepest parts of out oceans. Ir would liquidfy metals. Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar sysem even though Mercury is closer to our sun. Venusian geology and weather presents additional impediments like erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lighting strikes to probes seeking to land on its surface.  Venus was probaly covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth. Venus still has some features just like Earth. The planet has rocky sediment and includes familar features like valleys mountains and craters but, you have to consider given the long time frames of space travel.  Venus would allow scientist to float above the fray. A cehicle hpvering over Venus would avoid the unfriendly ground conditions by staying up and out of the way. You would have to be 30 plus miles above the surface. The temperture will still be hot around 170 degrees. The air pressure would be close to sea level on Earth. ""Radation would not exceed Earths levels."" The conditions on Venus would be survable for humans. "" Most forms of light cannot penetrate the dense atmosphere, rendering sandard forms of photography and videpgraphy ineffective.""  "" Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation."" ""Reaseachers cannot take samples of rock, gas, or anything else from a distance."" "

995	The electoral college method is a process that consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for the President and the Vice president, and the counting of the electoral votes by Congress. This means that that people are not directly voting for who they want to be president but voting for an elector that then places a vote. The founding fathers established it in the Constitution as a comprimise between election of the president by a vote in Congress and election of the president by a popular vote of qualified citizens. The Electoral College consists of 538 electors, and a majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the president.  But the other process of voting for a president is what we have now, it is called the popular vote, in which people go to a place where there are machines that you can place your vote for the president you want elected, the person with the most votes becomes the president of the United States and the person that lost the popular vote is elected vice president. 
996	In order for the Electoral College to elect a presidant they need 270 votes out of 538 Electors. Each state or country has electors in them. The candidates running for presidant have their own electors. Every 4 years a presidential election is held at the same time on tuesday after the first monday of novemeber.

998	"The planet venus also known as the ""Evening star"" is one of the brightes in the night sky. Venus is also like a twin of earth the characteristics of this planet is alike except for the speed and the size.  A thick atmosphere of about 97% of carbon dioxide covers the planet venus. When you pass that the surface of the earth is 800 degrees fahrenheit and verry deadly to any creacher that lives on earth. the atmospheric pressure is 90% than what we experience here. So why do scientist still study and figure out how life can form on this planet? well...Scientist want to study this planet because they believe it was similar and an earth-like planet. When the planet was and Earth-like planet it could have supported the life that lives on the actual earth now. On venus there were oceans,rivers,valleys,and ect. could we return to this planet? Scientist say that returning to earth is indisputable. Scients also want to figure out how they can send people there and be successfull? NASA want to design a blimp like vhical that can hover over venus without touching the unbarable ground but would give little insight of the planet. Scientist could not take samples of rock or gas or anything eles. Many researchers are tryin to come up with an idea so that they can get all their information on venus. "
