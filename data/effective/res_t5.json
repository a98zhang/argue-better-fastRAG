In the 23 Amendment of the constitution, the district of columbia is allocated 3 electors and treated\u00a0 like a state for purposes of the electoral college. For this reason, in the following discussion, the word \"state\" also refers to the district of columbia. Next, each canidate running for president in your state has his or her own group of electors.  The electors are generally chosen by the candidate's political party,but state laws vary on how the electors are selected and what their responsibilities are.  The president election is held every four years on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. Also, most states have a \"winner-take-all\" system that awards all electors to the winning presidential canidate . However, Maine and Nebraska each have a variation of \"proportion representation\".  Abolishing the electoral college! But don't worry they're not alone; according to a Gallup poll in 2000, taken shortly after Al Gore.  Thanks to the quirks of the electoral college, which won the popular vote but lost the presidency, over 60 percent of voterswould prefer a direct election to the kind we have now.  Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president.  You might not know this so if you dont here is something very interesting for you to know. Who are the electors? Well they can be snoyone not holding public office. Here's something eles you might know, Who picks the electors in the first place? well here's the answer it depends on the state. The single best argument against the electoral college is what we might call the disaster factor.  The American people should consider themselces lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century; the system allows for must more. consider that state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors, and thats those electors could always defy the will of the people.

During their time the founding fathers where among the most educated men in the country. Back then education was not standard and very few people could read or write. The founding fathers did not want uneducated citizens voting on the individual who would lead the country.

There would be a point where some sort of electronics would be needed. And as of right now, there is not an effective enough invention that could put humans on Venus to live and research. ",

During our \"recession\" Americans were \"unemployed\" and \"unable to pay (The end of car culture 32).\" Because citizens were not able to pay for cars, they did not use them, thus as you get adapted to a new situation you tend to stay with it.

                "content": "people all over the world are paying attention to what they can do to help the environment, meaning that this is an advantage that will appeal to a widespread audience. One way that limiting car usage will help is that it will reduce greenhouse gas emissions. In Elisabeth Rosenthal's essay \"In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars\", she writes, \"Passenger cars are responsible for 2 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe ... and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States\". By limiting the usage of cars, the amount of greenhouse gases being emitted into the world would decrease substantially. While the idea that everyone would stop using their cars and the gas emissions caused by them would disappear completely is unrealistic, the prospect that a majority of the emissions could do so is perfectly reasonable. The reduction of these emissions would mean that the air quality would increase and be overall healthier for both all the world's population and all the wildlife across the world. Robert Duffer provides another example of how less car usage would impact the environment in his essay, \"Paris bans driving due to smog\". According to the article, an intense smog had covered Paris for five days, when the city decided to ban car usage over the course of two days. The cause for the smog was thought to be the high use of diesel fuel in France, with 67 percent of cars using it over gasoline, about 14 percent higher than the rest of Western Europe. The plan for the ban had been that cars with even-numbered license plates to not be used the first day and for ones with odd-numbered license plates not to be used the next day. In actuality, cars with odd-numbered plates were never banned from driving since the smog had cleared just after the first day. This shows the impact of limiting car usage. In just one day, a smog that was comarable to the one in Beijing, China, one of the most polluted cities in the world, was removed considerably after just half the normal amount of cars were used over the course of a day. If this was used all over the world, the result would be even more significant. This evidence supports that limiting car use is good for the environment in more ways than one. ",

Always listen to yourself when someone is forcing you and not always be a follower, but also listen to other opinons when they are not forcing you. ",

Another thing, some people have more experience with giving advice. Some people are just more fit to give you advice. For example, who would you be more comfortable taking an opinion from, a friend or a therapist? You may know where to look, but its probably safer to simply get more people's opinions. Even so, sometimes people who aren't in those particular fields tend to think more simply, which might be what you need along with that professional opinion to form a bigger, clearer\u00a0picture. If you're having trouble picturing what I mean, think of it like a doctor. If you get back your diagnosis and it seems wrong or misinformed, you'll probably end up asking for a second opinion.

He explains how they are working on some simplified electronics, made of silicon carbide, that have been testedd in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface. This may sound like a good thing, but it is far from one. This is because the author finsihes by saying that the electronics lasted only three weeks.

However, this reasoning is flawed in that it assumes that citizens of a state are more likely to inform theirselves thouroughly simply because their vote holds more value, in a sense. Also, candidates would no longer pay special attention to swing states if the electoral college weren't in place so the votes of these citizens wouldn't be held above the rest. Increased value of votes is not a good thing, which this argument also assume. It is the best decision to abolish the Electoral College.   ",

He explains how they are working on some simplified electronics, made of silicon carbide, that have been testedd in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface. This may sound like a good thing, but it is far from one. This is because the author finsihes by saying that the electronics lasted only three weeks.

Once more, this is slightly irrelevant and does not contribute to the story at all except to add another paragraph instead of focusing on the specifics of how NASA is using them to help with Venus.

Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth\" (The Challenge of Exploring Venus). If Venus could've supported human life long ago, it is likely the planet still can. The scientific facts throughout this statement support the author's claim by having a reliable source of information, supporting the idea. Paragraph 4 reads, \"Today, Venus still has some features that are analogous to those on Earth. The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters\" (The Challenge of Exploring Venus). Venus already has Earth-like landscapes and other similar formations. This supports the author's idea of exploring Venus because it is so similar to Earth, the chances of survival are higher than any other planet. ",

For example, if a student has a resting face that seems generally happy, the system might confuse this dazed face as a satisfied face and think that the student is happy with their lessons when they are actually confused or not paying attention. In the same way, if a student has a resting face that looks naturally sad, the system may think they are unhappy with their lessons, even if the student feels they are learning a lot. A lot of students also try to hide their emotions, like frusteration or sadness, with a happier look on their face, and even though the article states that the system can detect a \"false smile\", it cannot always be accurate as a person may be good at hiding their emotions and displaying a genuine smile.

He explains, \" On the planet's surface, the temperature averages over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet.\" Considering that this is true, we can definitrly assume that condition on Venus are severly dangerous, and a lot of people may get hurt trying to explore it.

What the author is stating here is that not even our strongest materials and creations can withstand the conditions on Venus. This means that in order to explore Venus we have to design all new machinery, which would cost a lot of money, not to mention the human costs as we would need humans to test things out. He also makes it notable that venus has the hottest surface of any planet, despite not being the closest to the sun. All of these facts are serious concerns when regarding human safety as well as propr functioning of machines. Even if exploring Venus was a possibilty, would it be even be worth it after all of he human costs and money costs or paid.

Managing a cell phone while driving is now putting you in a life or death situation that you wouldn't want to be put in.   ",

This may restrict students from taking classes that they are interested in or limit students from branching out and potentially finding a new passion. However, students taking online classes can choose from a wide variety of classes, that most likely incorporate their interests. The lack of restraint in regards to the courses offered in distance learning is beneficial for students. Not only do student have the freedom to choose what to learn, they also have the freedom to choose when to learn. Having the freedom of choosing when to learn is vital for students with specific needs or disabilities. When students are unable to go to school, learning can continue. This eliminates sick days, weather delays or cancellations, and school holidays. Furthermore, students are able to take courses at their own speed. Rather than the typical every other\u00a0day school schedule, students can master a course in less than a month. The lack of restraint in regards to the courses offered in distance learning and when a student can learn is beneficial for all students. ",

Not every student thinks the same way, so they should be encouraged to express their creativity to establish a diverse school setting. Additionally, some students may possess specific learning disabilities such as ADHD, dyslexia, autism, mental illnesses, and more. In this case, these students require much more attention from their teachers to help guide them through this process, but an online class can only do so much. The teachers may be going at a faster pace than what these students can normally handle or they are confused about a certain area of the subject, so their frustrations may build up and lead to detrimental effects on their mental health. Although it is considered to be personalized learning, these individuals require careful guidance towards achieving the same success that their counterparts are experiencing. In the sense of virtual learning, these individuals are at a disadvantage because their learning disabilities are beyond their control. Video conferencing may be an option, but students with learning disabilities prefer not to share with their peers that they are struggling in a certain area or having difficulties understanding the curriculum, but would much rather keep this information confidential between themselves and their teachers.

For a moment, imagine that it's time to vote for the President, and person 1 has no idea of who to vote for.  So person one goes back to his/her good friend person 2, then asks, \"Person two, who are you voting for?\" Person two replies with his/her chosen candidate, and person one asks several other people, and finally, person four tells person one about the candidate that he/she has chosen, and person one also votes for that person, because from what person four said, that person will do great things as President. If person one had just asked person two who to vote for, he/she never would've known that person four had chosen the candidate that was right for person one's beliefs. Another benefit to getting multiple people's solutions is that the different advice can be applied to the same problem until something works. For example, person one is trying to fix that pesky flat tire on his/her car, and then the advice that person two and person three gave. Because person one can't get person four to help, because person four is on vacation in Norway, person one decides to apply the advice of person two and person three to see if something works, and it turns out that person two had good advice once person one figured out what person two was trying to say.

With this in mind, if students were able to be introduced and subject to this technology, there could be future scientist that want to further improve this technology and, until then, would be more involved in it's place at school. (D'Alto 1). Also, due to the fact that this technology is not only limited to the classroom, it is then evident that other jobs could be produced out of this technology being in the classroom, sparking interest in young and vulnerable students. As the author includes, \"The same technology can make computer-animated faces more expressive--for video games or video surgery,\" it is showsn just exactly how various the fields are that this technology could be used in. (D'Alto 6). Whether a kid is devoted to learning about medicne or engrossed in playing games, it has been shown that this technology in the classrooms would expose these kids to it's capabilities and potentially create a passion. (D'Alto 6). Therefore, by including this technolgy in the classroom with it's own purpose, the students would be subject to technolgy that is blooming in several fields and could easily inspire a child to become something that utilizes this technology in their future.

Romney knew that there was no incentive to campaign heavily in the South, because he would not gain any electoral votes by increasing his plurilaty in states he knew he would win. If popularity decided the president, residents of the other regions might feel like their vote would not count, and that the president would have no regard for their interests. Say that popularity did actually determine a winner. While most regions might vote for a certain presidents, the ones that did not would feel like that the man running the country wasnt really \"their president\". However, Mr. Senator, if the Electoral College was to stay, this problem would never exist. With the system we have now, the people vote for your state's electors when they vote for the president. Most states also have a \"winner-take-all\" system. Therefore, the canidate with the most votes in a state win's that state's electors. This lets the voting be even, fair.

People can just sit back and watch the electors take the power, while the others do nothing but be slumps. In source one, the Office of the Federal Register mention that \"when you vote for your candidate you are actually voting for your candidate's electors.\", which means that if voters have friends in the position of an elector, voters might just vote for the elector because theres nothing else to really pay attention to.

Research and experimentation taking place on Earth is giving scientists and astronauts more options for studying Venus. Although conditions on Venus are not hospitable to life, these new scientific advances are making it possible for data-gathering equipment to be sent to the surface of Venus and last long enough to gather data. Other scientists are moving away from traditional electronics and looking into purely mechanical systems. \"Systems that use mechanical parts can be made more resistant to pressure, heat, and other forces\" (7). The alternative that has presented itself to would-be explorers of Venus is older technology, like that found in the earliest computers. Scientists have realized that modern technology is too fragile and that more durable technologies are needed. By turning to other forms of technology, scientists are widening their options for ways to study Venus. The author mentions three different ways that scientists are making progress towards being able to study Venus - from the air, using new materials, and using old technologies. The author's postion that Venus should continue to be studied is supported by the scientific advancements that are serving to make studying Venus a reality. ",

What if someone wants to buy a Cadillac. Obviously, Cadillacs\u00a0are expensive and the person would ask somebody before spending their hard earned money on a Cadillac. If the person asks their best friend who thinks they are ugly if they should get a Cadillac, they would obviously say no. The best friend has an opinion on Cadillacs. If the person had asked somebody who thinks Cadillacs are amazing, they would say to buy it. This is an example of why asking multiple people before making a choice is good because they might have different opinions. If someone wants to open a donut\u00a0shop, but their uncle hates donuts. When they ask their uncle if they should open a donut shop, he will say no. He has an opinion of thinking donuts taste gross. But when they ask their sister who loves all desserts and will always support her sibling. She will say yes because she has an opinion of loving sweet foods and her siblings. This is an example of why people should ask more than one person before they do something. The student president might want to start a book club. A lot of students a do not like books because their teacher made them read a boring book three years ago and they have not liked books since then, they have an opinion on books from a long time ago. The teachers, on the other hand, love this idea because they think that students these days do not get enough reading time in and a book club would be a good idea. If the student president would not have asked the teachers if they liked the idea there would be no book club ",

No matter how cool it would be if it was not to mention that it could make NASA famous or rich it just doesn't have the proof you need to be a alien artifact. If you look more into the passage it even says it was not a alien made artiffact. Yes this face was very famous it even says \"The \"Face\" on Mars has since been a pop icon. It has starred in a Hollywood film, apperered in books, magazines, and even radio shows.\" (5). See how famous that face was 25 years ago is amazing but it still doesn't mean it was a alien made artiffact. So in final say it is not a alien made face and nor will there be enough proof its just a landmark on Mars that was very popular to people everywhere!           ",

You can also build property on spaces to make the enemy players pay more. If you were to buy those, you practically win the game. On the other hand, the spaces at the begining are basiclly worthless, costing about 100 dollars and giving you about 1000. Those are like the small states, that have almost no value to the election, and the big states are worth a lot. ",

        "query": "Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, the U.S Chamber of Commerce, and the AFL-CIO, in their time , agreed on? Abolishing the electoral college. Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for the slate of electors, who in turn elect the president.  Who picks the electors? It depends on the state. Sometimes state conventions, sometimes the state party's central comittee, sometimes the presidentail canidates themselves. Voters can't controls whom their electors vote for. Well not always .Voters sometimes get very confused about the votes in vote for the wrong canidate.  The best arguement against the electoral college is called Disater Factor. The Americans should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election in a century. Back in 1960, segregations in Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratics with new electors that would oppose John F. Kennedy.  The Electoral College is widely regarded as an anachronism, a non-democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be overruled by declaring the canidates who recieve the most votes. A dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is possible, it happened in 2000, but it's less likely than a dispute over popular vote.  The Electoral College requires a presidential Canidate to have trans-regional appeal. No other region ( South, Northwest, etc.) has enough electoral votes to elect a president. The winner takes all method of awarding electoral votes. The electoral College avoids the problems of elections in which no canidate recieves a majority of the votes cast. For an example, nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992 both had only a 43 percent plurality of the popular votes.       \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ",

        "query": "The founding fathers established it in the Constitution as acompromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by popular vote of quilified citizens. Your state's entitled allotment of electors equals the number of members in its Congressional delegation, one for each member in the House of Representatives plus\u00a0 two for your Senators. The presidential election is held every four years on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. You help choose your state's electors when you vote for your candidate you are actually voting for your candidate's electors. The Certificate of Ascertainment also declares the winning presidential candidate in your state and shows which electors will represent your state at the meeting of the electors in December of the election year. Your state's Certificates of Ascertainments are sent to the Congress and the National Archives as part of the official records of the presidential election. At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winner-take-all system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states the know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on thje tight\u00a0 races in the \"swing\" sates. During the 2000 camaign, seventeen states din't see the candidates at all, inckuding Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters inn 25 of the largest media markets didn't get to see a single campaign ad. If anyone has a good argument for putting the fate of the presidency in the hands of a few swing voters in Ohio, they have yet to make it. The electoral College requires a presindential candidates to have trans-regional appeal. No region (South, Northeast, etc.) has enough electoral votes to elect a president. So a solid regional favorite, such as Rommey was in the South, has no incentive to campaing heavily in those states, for he gains no electoral votes by increasing his plurality in states that he knows he will win. This is a desirable result because a candidate with only regional appeal is unlikely to be a succesful president. The residents of the other regions are likely to feel disenfranchised, to feel that their votes do not count, that the new president will have no regard for their interests, that he really isn't their president.

People must remember that this system is a compromise for the election and that any change could lead to problems among the government again. The public must also remember that \"each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee\".(Richard A. Posner). This system also can often prevent disputes. \"A dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is possible...but it's less likely than a dispute over the popular vote. The reason is that the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College invariably exceeds his share or the popular vote.\" (Richard A. Posner). Along with the fewer disputes, it also creates standards for the candidate. \" The Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal...This is a desirable result because a candidate with only regional appeal is unlikely to be a successful president.\" (Richard A. Posner). Another benefit to this system is that it causes voters to pay closer attention to the election. \"Voter in toss-up states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign.\" (Richard A. Posner). Along with the more aware voters, the Electoral College is also very beneficial to the big states. \"The Electoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states (by population) lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment of the Senate decreed in the Constitution.\" (Richard A. Posner). And lastly, the Electoral Collee helps avoid run-off elections. \"There is pressure for run-off elections when no candidate wins a majority of the votes cast; that pressure, which would greatly complicate the presidential election process, is reduced by the Electoral College, which invariably produces a clear winner.\" (Richard A. Posner). To sum it all up, there are many benefits to the Electoral College. ",

As children with developing brains, staying on task with all of these factors\u00a0can only be accomplished by a few, but not the majority. A study conducted by the University of Virginia states that, \"almost 90% of students under the age of 18 have an attention span of about 10-30 minutes before becoming distracted\" (Generic_Name). This exemplifies how most students cannot stay focused in a video based classroom when there is no adult supervisor or teacher directly making sure they listen, which is quite difficult to achieve via distance learning. With this in mind, it is harder for students to have motivation to complete work during class time\u00a0when they have easy access to other sources of entertainment right at their fingertips. Thus, video based learning is detrimental to student's work ethic because it gives them no motivation to complete their work whereas in the normal school system, they would be forced to work on it during class because of a direct presence of an adult supervisor keeping them on track. All in all, a world without video learning for all students is a one that strengthen's one's work ethic through practice in the work place rather than at home. ",

Would I use my two younger siblings advice even though they have never done this type of school work, or would I take advice from my parents and older sibling who have experience. The answer is obvious, even though there are almost an even amount of people on both sides, you stick with who has experience. Finally my favorite way of using comparing and contrasting the advice. If you have a bunch of different opinions and none of them really match up or there are no patterns and repeats, you get to make it. In this case you can pick and pull parts from all the advice and build your own advice for yourself based off of other people's ideas.

When I get home, I have a substantial amount of homework to do, and I have to practice the sports I play. My schedule is already full. homework takes me the longest to do. I work on my homework thoroughly. I try to make sure there isn't any mistakes. When I do this, I'm more likely to pass the test because of how much thought and time I have put into my work. I describe this as my work ethic. My homework takes me about two to four hours at most and it takes up most of my schedule. The sports that I play take two hours. With a total of seven hours at most, I can never seem to fit anything else in my schedule. This might be surprising for other people but this is the daily schedule for average students and most students might have more to do. If we even tried to do an extra activity than we wouldn't be able to finish all of our work efficiently and properly. Adding another thing to do every day would throw off our work ethic and our grades would most likely go down. Time has such a drastic effect on us students because it can be hard to manage. Our parents, for example, suffer from time management along with us. If we all do an extra activity, then that means that school is extended another few minutes. This is hard for our parents who pick us up after school. They have to find another time to pick us up which can be stressful since their schedule is as cramp as ours. We are not able to participate in an extra curriculum because of the amount of time that we don't have, and even if we were able to, there might not be any other options. ",

But some people show emotions in various ways, and the technology most likely cannot accomodate for the many different ways people express the same emotion. For example, if a student has a resting face that seems generally happy, the system might confuse this dazed face as a satisfied face and think that the student is happy with their lessons when they are actually confused or not paying attention. In the same way, if a student has a resting face that looks naturally sad, the system may think they are unhappy with their lessons, even if the student feels they are learning a lot. A lot of students also try to hide their emotions, like frusteration or sadness, with a happier look on their face, and even though the article states that the system can detect a \"false smile\", it cannot always be accurate as a person may be good at hiding their emotions and displaying a genuine smile.

An example that would show this is voting for an elected official using one persons advice verses voting an elected official using multiple peoples advice. On one side, using one persons advice can result in a much more simpler reason to vote for a official. This also allows for a lot less stressful voting process as you do not have to compare different candidates. However, using multiple people means it is more likely that you will get more unbiased results. This also means that you can kind of figure out what the general \"popular vote\" is, or in other words, what the general majority of people are voting. This example shows that asking one person for a solution does not always allow for the best solution because most of the time, you are not receiving unbiased opinions unless you ask multiple people.

This can be applied to advice because, if someone were to ask several different people for advice, they could get completely different advice from different people, and, chances are, some of the advice can really help instead of giving the person that needs advice useless information floating around. For a moment, imagine that it's time to vote for the President, and person 1 has no idea of who to vote for.  So person one goes back to his/her good friend person 2, then asks, \"Person two, who are you voting for?\" Person two replies with his/her chosen candidate, and person one asks several other people, and finally, person four tells person one about the candidate that he/she has chosen, and person one also votes for that person, because from what person four said, that person will do great things as President. If person one had just asked person two who to vote for, he/she never would've known that person four had chosen the candidate that was right for person one's beliefs. Another benefit to getting multiple people's solutions is that the different advice can be applied to the same problem until something works. For example, person one is trying to fix that pesky flat tire on his/her car, and then the advice that person two and person three gave. Because person one can't get person four to help, because person four is on vacation in Norway, person one decides to apply the advice of person two and person three to see if something works, and it turns out that person two had good advice once person one figured out what person two was trying to say.

At thirty-plus miles above the surface, temperatures would still be toasty at around 170 degrees Fahrenheit, but the air pressure would be close to that of sea level on Earth. Solar power would be plentiful, and radiation would not exceed Earth levels. Not easy conditions, but survivable for humans.\" (paragraph 5).

This idea is to have humans 30 or so miles above Venus for exploration. The author claims how this would be beneficial in keeping humans safe from the Venusian landscape. However, The author does not support this idea well, as he goes on to say how not much exploration can be done from there, and the conditions would still be extremely dangerous but \"survivable\". Also in paragraph 7, the author explains how NASA is working on other approaches to study Venus. He explains how they are working on some simplified electronics, made of silicon carbide, that have been testedd in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface. This may sound like a good thing, but it is far from one. This is because the author finsihes by saying that the electronics lasted only three weeks. If a computer can't withstand Venus's conditions longer than three weeks, I am very doubtful that a human can. This proves my point that our technology is far too inadvanced for such a task like exploring another planet. Therefore supporting my claim that the author did a poor job in supporting this idea. ",

It is obvious that the voters only know so much of what they vote for and do not really get a good taste of how the presidential canadidate is like. It can be clear that as a blind election, the voters have no hints of who they might be voting towards and in the end can cause a major catasrophe if a canadidate has very little intentions for the states. In agreement to the article the text  In the defense of the electoral college by Richard A. Posner it begins to sate the election of Romney who, by increasing his plurality and possesing only regional appeal, lost the peoples desire to vote for him thinking that the man has no regards for their interest and does not have any intentions of improving their needs or helping with creating a community where the people can rely on Romney. The actions taken began to change the thoughts of the citizens and create a petrifying conclusion that the man was not on the run to be everyone's president. This dilema could have been changed around if Romney had shown that he had cared more for his state and his country and thought more about the needs he could fill and the actions he could improve, then many of the voters would have most likely shown repsect and a desire for the man to be choosen as their new president. On the opposing hand Romney had not shown any of those qualities or passion which had caused for him to be thought of as unresponisble and selfish.  The country has more than thousands and thousands of people to serve and direct. It can be understood that having a large amount of citizens can result in uncertainty towards the election and the votes cast, yet it is yet to be changed to a more reasonable way of confronting it. With many systems such as \"Winner-Take -All\" due to states titled as the \"Swing States,\" it can be an untrustworthy election fo rmany voters around the country. The election process not only need to be changed to select a more responsible canadidate, but to create a more trustworthy system of itself.  ",

This is unfair to people in the Dakotas or Montana have no information to base their votes on, instead just picking a canidate by mainly party affiliation. the biggest political battles are in fact fought over the biggest states, in the forms of advertisements and propaganda. Although the propaganda is truely just that: propaganda, there is some truth in them, and the voters in bigger states are more well versed in the political and practical advantages of one canidate over the other. Article 3, while defending the Electoral College, in fact condems itself, by saying that voters in so called \"swing states,\" where there is no true dominant party, are likely to be given the most information on the canidates as they battle over who will get that state's votes in the college. The same thing can be said for the bigger states, because neither politician can really afford to let the other gain the upper hand in that state. Therefore smaller states, or states that are basicly marooned on one party are ignored or disregarded as worthless and unattainable in any case, so they widthold information from them, forcing them to vote blindly in favor of whichever party they choose, which votes may be discarded anyway. With an uncensored popular vote, the political canidates will be forced to advertise for all of the united states, instead of just the bigger or indevisive states. this will also remove all of the unfair advantages from the larger states, including more information as well as an unfairly weighted voting system.

The author believes that sometimes humans cannot let curiosity, imagination, and innovation be trampled by the dangers and doubts. Humans cannot live in fear all the time. The human spirit always demands that humans continue striving towards knowing more.   ",

But some people show emotions in various ways, and the technology most likely cannot accomodate for the many different ways people express the same emotion. For example, if a student has a resting face that seems generally happy, the system might confuse this dazed face as a satisfied face and think that the student is happy with their lessons when they are actually confused or not paying attention. In the same way, if a student has a resting face that looks naturally sad, the system may think they are unhappy with their lessons, even if the student feels they are learning a lot. A lot of students also try to hide their emotions, like frusteration or sadness, with a happier look on their face, and even though the article states that the system can detect a \"false smile\", it cannot always be accurate as a person may be good at hiding their emotions and displaying a genuine smile. Therefore, since technology is not always accurate and because human beings are so various in the way they behave, the technology would not be useful in a classroom where it may misread a student's state of mind and lead them in the wrong path of education.

High School and Middle School students tend not to share their emotions, even with their parents. FACS could idntify students that are emotionally troubled, have depression, contemplate self harm or even have mental illness. Once students like these are identified then counselers and social workers could step in, allowing for students to be helped. Right now students that struggle with these issues do not share their feelings. They do not get help and carry on like they are fine. While many may turn out to be okay, even one taking their own life or somebody's else, is too much. While FACS may not be able to help or eliminate all signs of emotional distress, it can surely make a difference. Another benfit of using FACS is that it reads emotoins silently. Students don't have to potray a certain emotion for the technology to understand what they are really feeling. If a studnet is asked how they are, they probably give a surface level, I am fine, answer. The technology reads through that completely, eliminating awkard one on one conversatoins with conselers, and allowing for all students to be reached. ",

Technology in school has rapidly increased especially as every student at Generic_School now has their own laptop for their own educational use. Now every student can get their work done through a computer at school, but not every student or teacher prefers it. Therefore, today, some schools offer distance learning for students to attend classes from home by way of online testing and course learning on their own. Many students and especially parents are skeptical of these online distance courses because they think that the old fashioned way of staying in school and using paper and pencil is the optimal way of learning. On the other hand, many people think otherwise, so this has become a great debate in the system of education for many counties and individual schools. ",

We have processors that can count the number of people that like apples versus oranges and come out with a percentage, verdict, reciept, and the best bussines option as soon as the numbers are input, as soon as we push that little blue \"Enter\" button. We can send the votes through the air in the billions, without as much as wires to conduct them. there is little or no possibility of tampering or miscommunication, and there are records to back up and correct every single little error. it is much smarter, safer, and more accurate to initiate a simple counting program on the computer, with each individual terminal sending all of it's results and information to a higher terminal until all of the information is scored, backed up, double checked, counted, percentaged, and a final verdict is reached. This can even be done in a way to run the information separately to different computers, to minimize tampering. ",

For a moment, imagine that it's time to vote for the President, and person 1 has no idea of who to vote for.  So person one goes back to his/her good friend person 2, then asks, \"Person two, who are you voting for?\" Person two replies with his/her chosen candidate, and person one asks several other people, and finally, person four tells person one about the candidate that he/she has chosen, and person one also votes for that person, because from what person four said, that person will do great things as President. If person one had just asked person two who to vote for, he/she never would've known that person four had chosen the candidate that was right for person one's beliefs. Another benefit to getting multiple people's solutions is that the different advice can be applied to the same problem until something works.

In the same way, if a student has a resting face that looks naturally sad, the system may think they are unhappy with their lessons, even if the student feels they are learning a lot. A lot of students also try to hide their emotions, like frusteration or sadness, with a happier look on their face, and even though the article states that the system can detect a \"false smile\", it cannot always be accurate as a person may be good at hiding their emotions and displaying a genuine smile.

The same thing can be said for the bigger states, because neither politician can really afford to let the other gain the upper hand in that state. Therefore smaller states, or states that are basicly marooned on one party are ignored or disregarded as worthless and unattainable in any case, so they widthold information from them, forcing them to vote blindly in favor of whichever party they choose, which votes may be discarded anyway.

The Electoral College only has a little over five hundred electors that are representing the millions of regular people who show up at the polls on election day.

A teacher would not be able to identify a student's weaknesses, resulting in a weaker result than anticipated. ",

These countries have temporarily closed their schools until April in order to better combat the novel corona virus, COVID-19. That said, the schools are still holding lessons online where attendance is taken and students are given the same education by the same teachers, only through a computer screen. If it is feasible for other nations to accommodate for their students during a health epidemic then surely we can also implement a similar program for our students during times of peace. Furthermore, we can not, both morally and legally, allow for our disabled students to receive a sub par\u00a0education than their peers.

If we some how passes through the atmosphere, than we'll face ANOTHER problem with the ground. Since Venus is the second planet from our sun and with all those carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, the surface ground temperature is over 800 DEGREES FAHRENHEIT. In which with the surface and the atmosphere, it could basically melt many types of metal with no problem. Another Problem is that the atmosphereic preassure is 90x greater than our Earth, with that much preassure could easily crushed a submarine that is built to surrvive the deeper end of the ocean. From what we gather small information from our space craft, the geology of venus pretty much have erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lighting strikes. ",

This ties back into people losing hope that their vote will not matter because they trust the electors to vote their canidate into office, when the electors could go either way. Another key point is, the canidates may not campaign in states that have a lower number of electoral votes. In Source 1 the Office of the Federal Register also asserted, \"Most states have a 'winner-take-all' system that awards all electors to the winning presidential canidate\".

Research and experimentation taking place on Earth is giving scientists and astronauts more options for studying Venus. Although conditions on Venus are not hospitable to life, these new scientific advances are making it possible for data-gathering equipment to be sent to the surface of Venus and last long enough to gather data. Other scientists are moving away from traditional electronics and looking into purely mechanical systems. \"Systems that use mechanical parts can be made more resistant to pressure, heat, and other forces\" (7). The alternative that has presented itself to would-be explorers of Venus is older technology, like that found in the earliest computers. Scientists have realized that modern technology is too fragile and that more durable technologies are needed. By turning to other forms of technology, scientists are widening their options for ways to study Venus. The author mentions three different ways that scientists are making progress towards being able to study Venus - from the air, using new materials, and using old technologies.

But some people show emotions in various ways, and the technology most likely cannot accomodate for the many different ways people express the same emotion. For example, if a student has a resting face that seems generally happy, the system might confuse this dazed face as a satisfied face and think that the student is happy with their lessons when they are actually confused or not paying attention. In the same way, if a student has a resting face that looks naturally sad, the system may think they are unhappy with their lessons, even if the student feels they are learning a lot. A lot of students also try to hide their emotions, like frusteration or sadness, with a happier look on their face, and even though the article states that the system can detect a \"false smile\", it cannot always be accurate as a person may be good at hiding their emotions and displaying a genuine smile. Therefore, since technology is not always accurate and because human beings are so various in the way they behave, the technology would not be useful in a classroom where it may misread a student's state of mind and lead them in the wrong path of education.

Ask the teacher for an extension? No, he's too strict and he's going to say no. So you think your only option is to cheat. So you text a student who took picures for the wrong reason.

Usually each state has a \"winner-take-all\" method, so the presidential candidate that gets majority in your state will get all of the electors that represent their party, not just most of them. This is beneficicial to the outcome of the election becuase it makes the ability for a candiate to get majority vote much simpler.

Source 3, \"In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep out despised method of choosing president\", states that \"even a very slight plurality in a state creates a landslide electoral-vote victory in that state...\" , therefore allowing the candidate to secure all votes to their side, instead of having the votes divided on the line of majority rule, and causing rifts between Electoral College voters.

People are supposed to be granted the opportunity to elect the president of their choice, not of somebody elses. The most popular vote would take into consideration of every citizen's opinion with a direct percentage of votes to elect a certain candidate. In the article, \"In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President,\" Richard A. Posner states, \"The Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal. No region (South, Northeast, etc.) has enough electoral votes to elect a president.\" This may be true but if the most popular vote system was put into place, there would be an even more exact number of how many people voted for each candidate. The Electoral College does not voice the opinions of all citizens because in reality, a person is not directly voting for their desired candidate. They are voting for other representatives that will hopefully, in turn, elect the candidate they want. Obviously, the Electoral College is definitely a system that should be abolished in the United States of America. ",

Students always want to find the easy way out, and online school could be that no challenge road.

For a moment, imagine that it's time to vote for the President, and person 1 has no idea of who to vote for.  So person one goes back to his/her good friend person 2, then asks, \"Person two, who are you voting for?\" Person two replies with his/her chosen candidate, and person one asks several other people, and finally, person four tells person one about the candidate that he/she has chosen, and person one also votes for that person, because from what person four said, that person will do great things as President. If person one had just asked person two who to vote for, he/she never would've known that person four had chosen the candidate that was right for person one's beliefs. Another benefit to getting multiple people's solutions is that the different advice can be applied to the same problem until something works. For example, person one is trying to fix that pesky flat tire on his/her car, and then the advice that person two and person three gave. Because person one can't get person four to help, because person four is on vacation in Norway, person one decides to apply the advice of person two and person three to see if something works, and it turns out that person two had good advice once person one figured out what person two was trying to say.

It is obvious that the voters only know so much of what they vote for and do not really get a good taste of how the presidential canadidate is like. It can be clear that as a blind election, the voters have no hints of who they might be voting towards and in the end can cause a major catasrophe if a canadidate has very little intentions for the states. In agreement to the article the text  In the defense of the electoral college by Richard A. Posner it begins to sate the election of Romney who, by increasing his plurality and possesing only regional appeal, lost the peoples desire to vote for him thinking that the man has no regards for their interest and does not have any intentions of improving their needs or helping with creating a community where the people can rely on Romney. The actions taken began to change the thoughts of the citizens and create a petrifying conclusion that the man was not on the run to be everyone's president. This dilema could have been changed around if Romney had shown that he had cared more for his state and his country and thought more about the needs he could fill and the actions he could improve, then many of the voters would have most likely shown repsect and a desire for the man to be choosen as their new president. On the opposing hand Romney had not shown any of those qualities or passion which had caused for him to be thought of as unresponisble and selfish.  The country has more than thousands and thousands of people to serve and direct. It can be understood that having a large amount of citizens can result in uncertainty towards the election and the votes cast, yet it is yet to be changed to a more reasonable way of confronting it. With many systems such as \"Winner-Take -All\" due to states titled as the \"Swing States,\" it can be an untrustworthy election fo rmany voters around the country. The election process not only need to be changed to select a more responsible canadidate, but to create a more trustworthy system of itself.  ",

This is unfair to people in the Dakotas or Montana have no information to base their votes on, instead just picking a canidate by mainly party affiliation. the biggest political battles are in fact fought over the biggest states, in the forms of advertisements and propaganda. Although the propaganda is truely just that: propaganda, there is some truth in them, and the voters in bigger states are more well versed in the political and practical advantages of one canidate over the other. Article 3, while defending the Electoral College, in fact condems itself, by saying that voters in so called \"swing states,\" where there is no true dominant party, are likely to be given the most information on the canidates as they battle over who will get that state's votes in the college. The same thing can be said for the bigger states, because neither politician can really afford to let the other gain the upper hand in that state. Therefore smaller states, or states that are basicly marooned on one party are ignored or disregarded as worthless and unattainable in any case, so they widthold information from them, forcing them to vote blindly in favor of whichever party they choose, which votes may be discarded anyway. With an uncensored popular vote, the political canidates will be forced to advertise for all of the united states, instead of just the bigger or indevisive states. this will also remove all of the unfair advantages from the larger states, including more information as well as an unfairly weighted voting system.

                "content": "Citizens' wishes will not always be equivalent to what the electors vote for. This occurs partly because of the winner-take-all system. In this system, the winner of the popular vote in an individual state wins all of the electoral votes a state has. According to the Office of the Federal Register, all but two states use this system. These two states are Nebraska and Maine. As a result of the winner-take-all system, it is possible that a presidential candidate loses the overall popular vote, but wins more electoral votes and thus wins the election. This occurance happened in the infamous 2000 election, when Al Gore won the popular vote but lost to George W. Bush by a mere five electoral votes. If the public indicated they wanted Al Gore as president, why should Bush have won due to this unfair system? It simply doesn't make sense. The winner-take-all system also results in political campaigns to focus their efforts in only certain regions. Some states very predictably vote either for the Republican candidate or for the Democratic candidate. Take Texas, for instance, which has traditionally always voted red. A Democratic candidate knows he should not focus his campaign in Texas, because he realizes his best efforts won't allow him to win the popular vote there and thus win the electoral votes. Because of the tendencies of certain states, many electoral votes are practically predetermined. The states which do not typically only vote in favor of one side are labelled \"swing states\". With the way the Electoral College works, the few states which are a toss-up carry the most weight. Presidential candidates will usually spend most of their time in these swing states, and very little time in others. For example, in the 2000 election, seventeen states were not visited by either candidate. Supporters of the Electoral College view the disproportional focus of campaigns as a positive. According to Richard A. Posner's article in favor of this corrupt system, \"The Electoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment of the Senate decreed in the Constituion...\" (21) ",

Then, psychologists have classified six basic emotions that are associated with different movements in the facial mucles.

However, these emotions can be decieving. Someone could say they are happy, when really they are angry or upset. This is where the Facial Action Coding System comes into play. The FACS is a software that detects human emotion by tracking muscles in the face. For example, when you are happy, muscles in your face move up, and when you are sad, they move down, FACS tracks this and calculates your emotions. The creators of this software, Prof. Thomas Huang and Prof. Nicu Sebe are the leading experts of developing better ways for humans and computers to communicate. There are still some questions surrounding the usefulness of FACS, like what could this software actually be used for? One of the ways FACS may be used is in classrooms. ",

Summer projects should be teacher-designed to insure the relevancy of the project, guarantee structured guidelines, and limit the unnecessary stress for students.\u00a0 ",

Adding to the quotes, on the top of the book said  #1 New York best Selling Book , basically saying to new readers that this series is good and popular. That is usually why on the front cover or back cover of a book contains a quote from different people or companies showing their good opinion about this book, so the readers can see that since this person liked the book, then it must be a good book to read. Having an award on your book also brings in popularity because winning something like the Pulitzer prize can bring a ton of attention to your book. It can give you more to believe in that your project will be good because you have many people who say your project is good. Not just the people who say that it's just \"good\", but also the people who point out the things that they especially liked within your idea, such as, \"I liked how you included this part to make that huge problem go away.\" These kinds of compliments makes you feel even better inside, and it tells you that you can take your mind off that one part of the idea and imagine more possible problems.

This line states that the lab partner will be able to tell a difference netween a genuine and meaningful smile from a harshly forced smile. There is a difference between the two because smiling will not make you happy although it is a happy gesture. The machine informing someone that they need to smile will not actually change the emotions of that person. Politicians and celebrities are major culprits of this action. They often smile as they are told to do, but they are not always genuine. They are typically hiding something from their spectators such as when they are not being truthful (D'Alto 8). Just because famous people smile when talking or looking at their audience does not change whether or not they are happy individuals. If humans themselves are unable to change their emotions when they can detect that something is wrong, then machines will be unable to do that also. Although it can give people a precise measurement of their emotions, it will not change how they feel. Therefore, investing in this system would be extremely useless and wasteful. ",

But some people show emotions in various ways, and the technology most likely cannot accomodate for the many different ways people express the same emotion. For example, if a student has a resting face that seems generally happy, the system might confuse this dazed face as a satisfied face and think that the student is happy with their lessons when they are actually confused or not paying attention. In the same way, if a student has a resting face that looks naturally sad, the system may think they are unhappy with their lessons, even if the student feels they are learning a lot. A lot of students also try to hide their emotions, like frusteration or sadness, with a happier look on their face, and even though the article states that the system can detect a \"false smile\", it cannot always be accurate as a person may be good at hiding their emotions and displaying a genuine smile. Therefore, since technology is not always accurate and because human beings are so various in the way they behave, the technology would not be useful in a classroom where it may misread a student's state of mind and lead them in the wrong path of education.

When going to a certain activity you go because you enjoy that one thing, well the other people there also enjoy that activity and now you know a whole bunch of people who share a common interest with you. sometimes even the smallest things can spark a friendship maybe you and someone play the same position on a sports team that can be a great reason to be friends or to even talk, doing extra curricular activities gets you out of your comfort zone and makes you feel just open and wanting to talk to people. When going to a certain activity thinking of how the people there are gonna act is a huge thing but most likely the environment is very welcoming and it makes you want to keep doing that one thing with the same people because of how they treated you.

In agreement to the article the text  In the defense of the electoral college by Richard A. Posner it begins to sate the election of Romney who, by increasing his plurality and possesing only regional appeal, lost the peoples desire to vote for him thinking that the man has no regards for their interest and does not have any intentions of improving their needs or helping with creating a community where the people can rely on Romney. The actions taken began to change the thoughts of the citizens and create a petrifying conclusion that the man was not on the run to be everyone's president. This dilema could have been changed around if Romney had shown that he had cared more for his state and his country and thought more about the needs he could fill and the actions he could improve, then many of the voters would have most likely shown repsect and a desire for the man to be choosen as their new president. On the opposing hand Romney had not shown any of those qualities or passion which had caused for him to be thought of as unresponisble and selfish.  The country has more than thousands and thousands of people to serve and direct. It can be understood that having a large amount of citizens can result in uncertainty towards the election and the votes cast, yet it is yet to be changed to a more reasonable way of confronting it.

The election process not only need to be changed to select a more responsible canadidate, but to create a more trustworthy system of itself.  ",

But students should not let the technology of today make them lazy and they should be willing to work hard and diligently.   \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0   \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 ",

They also do not benefit students by having more of a likely chance to cheat during exams online. Because of this, this does not prepare students for further growth of knowledge if they want to continue to do school after high school. The final reason students do not benefit from online courses is that students need friends in person because that is what makes them have a good childhood and become a better person based of off their opinions. To conclude, online courses are not a way to help students at all during this day and age. It has too many flaws that can not be fixed unfortunately. A lot of things are growing in this society, but this should not grow any further. ",

I glanced around, taking in the unfamiliar eyes staring me down.  I'm never going to fit in here.  One of the eyes turned away from me and began to speak. She formed strange sounds with her mouth in a language that wasn't familiar to me. I turned around and ran out of the room, feeling so alone, so deserted. Salty tears stained my cheeks.  A week ago, I had taken a 14 hour long flight from  Generic_City to Generic_City. It was my first time being somewhere else other than my home country, and I felt so intimidated by the new environment. Strange shapes, strange sounds, and strange people with impossibly bright hair and piercing eyes surrounded me. It was all beautiful to me - but at the same time, the most horrifying thing I'd ever seen. I felt trapped in a haze. This haze was brimming with thoughts of never fitting in, never adapting to these alien surroundings, and mostly - the crushing feeling of homesickness.  This haze pushed me down into a deep cavern, and I was encapsulated by darkness. Even though my parents tried to find me in this cavern, every search effort was in vain, until something miraculous happened. An angel, perhaps, entered the deep labyrinth and ushered me out. Her name was Ms. Generic_Name. She gave me a new perspective, a new bias. Ms. Generic_Name told me to view this unfamiliar atmosphere as something special, a new opportunity - not a hostile monster trying to swallow me whole. She told me to be glad of the change in my life. This was the first time I had ever listened to somebody's opinion and savored it in my heart. I didn't know the importance of listening to the viewpoints of others at the time. I thought  I always knew what was best; after all, nobody knew me better than myself. I took her words and used them as fuel for learning English and making friends. I thought her words were all I needed, but somehow, I was still in despair. I still struggled. So - I decided to let someone else tell me what they thought was best.  After school, I talked with my parents. I told them what I felt, that I was always alone. That I felt so, so homesick. They told me it was good to feel that way. Moving overseas was a tough thing to endure, and they said it was healthy to let myself feel down sometimes. They told me I didn't always need to pretend I was happy when I was not. These two opinions from Ms. Generic_Name and my parents shaped me as a person - I learned to let people in, and know that seeking multiple opinions is a wise thing to do.\u00a0Because of this, I learned to speak English and surround myself with a group of compassionate, kind friends who guided me through my darkest times. I learned to let in my parents and take notice that they always wanted what was best for me. I learned that I didn't always know what was best, and that was okay. ",

Due to the Electoral College system being based off population some states have more of a say than others. Whenever a state decides their votes for Electoral Colleges the state typically contributes every vote it has to one canidate. When this occurs the state's people may be misrepresented. ",

If you lived in texas for instance and wanted to vote for john kerry you'd vote for a slate of 34 democratic electors pledged to kerry,On the off-chance that those electors won the statewide election they would go to congress and kerry would get 34 lectoral votes. Each candidate running for president in your state has his or her own group of electors. The electors are generally chosen by the candidates,s political party, but state laws vary on how the electors are selected and what their reponsibilities are. At the most basic level the  Electoral College is unfair to voters because of the winner take all system in each state,canidatdes dont spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning.  Election by popular vote for the president of the  United States  Obama received 61.7 percent of the electoral votes compared to only 51.3 percent of the popular votes cast for him and romney becausw almost all states award electoral votes on a winner take all basis even a very slight plurality in a state creates a landslide electoral vote victory in that state. A tie in a nationwide electoral vote is possible because the total number of votes 538 is an even number,but it is highly unlikely but each party selcts a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee it is entirely possible that the winner of the electoral vote will not win the national popular vote.

It happened in 2000, when Gore had more popular votes than bush yet fewer electoral votes,but that was the first time since 1888 thats happened. there are five reasons for reraining the electoral college despite its lackof democratic pedigree all practical reasons not liberal or conservative reasons.

Each candidate running for President in a state has their own group of electors. After each election, the governor of your state prepares a certificate presenting all of the candidates that ran for your state. As stated in the article by the Office of the Federal Register, \"The Certificate of Ascertainment also declares the winning presidential candidate in your state and shows which electors will represent your state at the meeting of the electors in December of the election year.\" The Electoral College is what mantains everything professional.
