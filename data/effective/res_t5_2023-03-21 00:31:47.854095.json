                "content": "The author shows that the huge rock formation, which resembles a human head, is formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and a mouth. The author also states that Garvin said, \"as a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger that the pixel size, so if there were objects in this picture like, airplaines on the ground, or Egytian-style pyramids, or even small shacks, you could see what they were!\"   In 1988 a Viking 1 took a, slightly disturbing, picture. Of a face! Viking 1 found a landform that happends to look like an Egyptian Pharoah. This face was found and started major controversy.  Some people had thought that it was fake and others thought that it was just a coincidence. The massive sand storms just created a face. That's all that they thought. But can that be true?   This giant rock formation, which stretches for about two miles from end to end, isn't uncommon at all. Actually, it is a mesa which just has shadows that cast on it a certain way, which makes it look exactly like a face.  In 1976 the face looked like a face. In 1998 it started to not look like a face at all. In 2001 it just looked like a rock. So i believe that it was not created by aliens but that it was just something the olanet had made itself. This has certainly got the attention of the people.  The \"Face on Mars\" is not a face. If you look at the pictures from 1976, and 1998, and 2001 and in the text it says that the photo from 2001 is the most recent photo that NASA has. It still looks nothing like a face so since the 2001 picture is the most recent it shows that it is just a natural landform. It is just a natural landform. On Mars there are natural landforms everywhere and the fade away. Here on earth natural landforms are created everyday.  Contrary to popular belief, there is nothing unatural about the supposed \"Face on Mars\". Though many would like to believe in the supernatural, this oddity is nothing but a rock formation. There are several reasons as to why the theory of aliens making this formation is preposterous, each reason stronger than the previous.  In 1976, Viking 1 took photos of Mars and found a huge rock formation that remebled a human head with shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth.  This was soon to be known as the \"Face on Mars\".   NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft has found something while circling  Mars. But what is it, they have seem to have found a face formed into the rocks. Is this new discovery actually a face or is it just another rock formation.  The believers and the non-believers of the face on Mars are waiting anxiously to find out what it is. Is it a rock formation or is it an actual human face, no one knows  In paragraph 12, Garvin said, \" It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about thye sane height as the Face on Mars.\" Jim Garvin is saying that these formations on Mars are very similar to the ones that we have here on Earth. He is also saying that there os no face on Mars.  Some of the biggest tricks played are constructed by the eyes. When the first image of the face on Mars was revealed, the features such as the eyes and nose were most likely created by shadows. In the article it explains, \"A few days later NASA unveiled the image for all to see. The caption noted a 'huge rock formation...which resembles a human head...formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth.\"  It does look like it could be from another living organism, but it's just a rock on the planet. In our newest image of the rock, it turns out that the face has dissapered. There is no evidence of this being created by aliens, rather it was created by wind and water that has been found on Mars. The reason you might believe that this was indeed aliens, might be the fact that the news has blown it out of poportion. It's just the rock that had some interesting shadows and holes that made it look like a human face. ",

This evidence is only given in the last paragraph of the article and is not mentioned anywhere else. Also, the author lists many of the dangers of traveling to Venus, but does not dictate why it is worth the risk of exploring the planet.  The author supports their claim by giving numerous details and supporting his ideas.\"Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endbeavors.\" A big issue that is brought up are the harsh conditions Venus brings. \"On the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Farenheight, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet.\" Knowing this, you might think that they must stop there with their research because there's no way they can discover Venus now because it's to dangerous and harsh. That is false, \"NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray.\" Their solution is to have a vehicle hovering over Venus that would avoid the unfriendly ground conditions by staying up and out of their way. It would still be toasty but not deathly. The author claims, \" Not easy conditions, but survivable for humans.\" The author supports his claim by saying yes, the temperature is a challenge they will face, but NASA has one particular compelling idea for sending humans to study Venus, and they will continue to challenge themselves and find solutions to these conflicts they face.  In coclusion, the authors final claim states, \"Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation.\" Although there are many dangers that could seek upon them, they take them as \"challenges\" and are willing to dig deeper to find out why Venus is the way it is. \"Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth- like planet in our solar system.\" Therefore, this is why the author does a good job by suggesting that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents.     In Paragraph 8, the author claims, \"Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiousity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors.\" The author brought up the word \"challenge\" again,  The author of \"The Challenge of Exploring Venus\" did a fair job at arguing their claim, that Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents.  In \"The Challenge of Exploring Venus,\" the author supports the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents  In \"The Challenge of Exploring Venus\" the author supports Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presnts through his analysis of hovering, silicon carbide, and mechanical computers. He supports his ideas with evidence and also the analysis he has with his knowledge by research. He uses facts, and not a lot of opinions to express his ideas and belief that Venus is a worthy pursuit. He colcudes his argument that humanity's travels on Earth and beyond should never even be limited by threats of dangers or doubts. Without that, knowledge will be expanded and fuel the innovation of the human world and beyond.  In this article \"The Challenge of Exploring Venus,\" the author gives many details throughout this text as to why he believes that studying Venus is a worthy persuit despite the dangers.  First, the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers is well supported by the author as seen through the many rewards of studying Venus  The author of \"The Callenge of Exploring Venus\" did a fair job when arguing that Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. While the author did accurately present the dangers and solutions for the dangerous parts of exploring Venus, they failed to create a strong thesis. The author exceeded when giving factual information about the topic to help the reading get on their side of the arguement; do to them struggling to get across their position on if Venus exploration is worthwhile, some of the provided information they gave was not used to it's full potential when changing the reader's opinion.

We take time to study our favorite candidates, and if the electoral college does not agree with them, they are pushed to the side. What happens to the people who did not vote for the, \"right\" candidate? They are forever unheard. Sentenced to live in a community where they are silcenced. I do not agree with the electoral college because agree with our fore father Abraham Lincoln. He said this was supposed to be a country of the people, by the people, and for the people.   The voters are left with an unfair outcome at almost every election because of the Electoral Collage. The votes can either be very close or the people could miss Ads or campaigns for canidates, leaving the people with nothing and confusion all over. Even if you knew what elector you voted for, you cant necessarily pick who it is your voting for and your vote could possibly get confued giving you a bad outcome. Most elections are just slid by and are just based on what ever the Electoral College thinks should happen. So please abolish the Electoral College its is irrational and is not neccessary, let the people really have a fair chance.  Sometimes the electoral candinates vote against the people that elected for them and go for what they think is right which in no case is incorrect but a hudreds of citizens were counting on them to make their choice. We all have a voice, we have to use it in the fair way, and the righthous way is mostly a popular vote  As in Source Two, I will ask you the question, \"Who picks the electors in the first place?\" Certainly not the citizens as a whole, most of the time its picked by the state governement in some shape or form, but sometimes, even the presidental candidates themselves can pick them (paaragraph 10)! As well as in Source Three, where its clearly pointed out that \"... it is the electors who elect the president, not the people,\" (paragraph 15). It's outragous how easily they can pull the wool over our eyes, and even worse how we let them. But no more.  In doing this you are having a fair vote in the election with everyone who is eligable to vote, voting whomever they please. If you vote for your own president of your choice there will not be any elector deciding for you if they do not like what you have elected. We need to have a say in what we want. I mean if we want someone to be watching over us, and deciding what to do, we want someone who everyine agrees on. Just a few hundred poeoplpe choosing for you is nothing compared to approximatley more than a million people choosing for themselves. In  Source 2 \"The indefensible electorial college : why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong by Bradford Plumer\"  it says that the electors can always defy the will of the people. In my case I believe that no one would want that. I mean, would you want that?  from the article \"The indefensible electoral colllege\" it says it was the biggest election crisis in the century\". Consider that state legislatures are technically responsible for\u00a0 picking electors, and that those electors wioll always defy the will of the people. If we the people vote for our choice to run this country their should not be any of these fiascos.  According to Source 2, \"state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors, and... those electors could always defy the will of the people.\" The defenders could be completely indifferent about the voters choices, or situations where swing states are borderline one party or another, and the Electoral College allows a limited selelction of people to make the final decision of millions (Source 1). The ballots that we vote in don't even effect the results of the election. It is as if these elections are trying to illude citizens from the fact that the only votes that contribute to the adoption of a new president are the electoral votes. Why bother letting us vote for a president, if only the defenders get to make the decisions?  First of all we don't know who picks the electors. We don't know if there truthful as in putting in votes. I'm sure they have to have certain requirments to become an elector but we are not the ones chosing them. In the 2000 campaign 17 states didn't even see the people running in the election. Also in an Electoral College ties exist so then it has to be thrown into the House of Represenatives where the delagations will vote on the president. Making our votes worthless because the people in the goverment get to chose whos next to become president.   They have much more power than the standard voter. The electors would completly oppose the most \"popular\" vote and put in their vote for whoever they feel deserves it. This is wrong and totally goes against the idea of giving the people power. This would qualify as just giving a few people power. There could also be room for a tie. This could result in the elcetion ending in the hands of the House of Representatives where the state delegates could chose the president. Not only is this destorying the power of the general public but this could also result in people not getting what they wanted. The delegates cuold go completly against what the people say because they technially have the right to since they have the power of the situation.  In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President\", author Richard A. Posner states that \"knowing [the voters'] vote has no effect [gives them] less incentitive to pay attention to the campaign.\" But, \"voters in presidential electons are people who want to express\u00a0 political preference rather than people who think that a single vote may decide and election.\" This means thatchanging everyone to a single vote will have no effect, too because people will not put thought into who to vote, but they will just vote for whoever.

We should get rid of the electoral college all together. This system is not working for a lot of people and this is why many people dont care enough to vote anymore. There are people that vote for our state. Why should the people care? If we switched to popular vote, our country might participate in picking who the next president of the United States will be. When people have a voice, they will use it as much as they possibly can.       \u00a0       \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     The Electoral College should be rid of. The process is not democratic and misrepresents voting citizens in more ways than one. If voters were able to directly vote for canidates then more states would actively engage in the campaign and all people would be represented equally. It would lower the chance for downfall, and the chance for incidents to occur. I propose that the next presidential election should use the process of popular vote to choose the next president for the United States.  After all, electoral colleges should be changed because it is better for the people so there is more of an input from smaller populated states, they will want to vote and there would be less of an ability to tie the election. Having a popular vote lets the citizens in big states that are metaphorically already \"chosen\" allows the minority vote to maybe have a chance in the office. Last but not least, it is understood that having the electoral college decreases wrong-doings, but if the elector chosen by the state changes his intentions just for himself, that gives the state no word about it.     You cannot deny, changing to election by popular vote for the president of the United States would be extremely beneficial for our country. Citizens would regain their Constitutional-right to vote for the leaders who make major decisions for the entire country. The Electoral College is useful to produce a clear winner in elections, but is evidently not completely necessary and is unfair to voters who want and deserve a say in the outcome(Plumer 13, 14). Abolishing this system would cause for a drastically more fair election and greater citizen satisfaction for multitudinous reasons. Please consider.  In conclusion, we should abolish the Electoral College in order to encourage more people to vote and to stop a catastrophe that is bound to happen soon. Acorrding to a Gallup poll done in 2000, over 60% over the American people would rather have a popular vote. This just prooves that the Electoral College is unfair, outdated, and irrational.   Having popular votes system will be arguably the best system to use for the election and towards the voting process. Using electoral votes will be unfair to voters when they are voting because of the simply winner-take-all basis of each and every one of the fifty states. Not only that it's unfair, it also causes many crisis in the United States dealing with this system alone and then eventually lead to dramatic chaos across the nation. Also, having the amount of electoral votes doesn't compare to the population of the actual state. Remember it is still one representative for the 500,000 people in Wyoming. Popular votes should be used in every political system no matter what situation it is. As the passage says, the argument against direct elections are spuriors at the best.  If there was no Electoral College candidates will be fighting for the popular vote. The problem with this popular vote is that there would be no candidate that recieves a majority of the votes. In an Electoral College there would not be this problem, since in each state the winner takes it all.  The popular voting method is not only a direct vote for the desired candidate of the people's choice ",

Yes, it is very dangerest because of high temperature and pressure. But if we come up with a way to lower the temperature and pressure it will be surely worth the work put in. These reason are way we should try to visit Venus in the future.  The second one is Venus could have once been able to be compatable for life.  This means there is a worthy reason to explore Venus; to discover another habitable planet. Along with successful life on Venus, our modern technology could also survive the planet. Paragraph 5 states, \"Imagine a blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the roiling Venusian landscape. Just as our jet airplanes travel at a higher altitude to fly over many storms, a vehicle hovering over Venus would avoid the unfriendly ground codnitions by staying up and out of their way\" (The Challenge of Exploring Venus). Moreover, if airplanes are already in existence, new aircrafts would need to be slightly adjusted to suit the conditions of Venus. The author's claim is supported in this quote because this is another reason Venus is worth exploring. The technology needed is already almost perfect for the planet, therefore not a problem NASA would have to approach.  The author also states that \"Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth.\". This shows the readers that Venus is worth studying because there may have been life on this planet. Therefore, NASA needs to send researchers to Venus to identify if there is life or not. The author gives another example by referencing Earth-like features to show that thesremay be some form of life or a way of nature, these references include Venus having mountains, valleys, and craters. This validates the authors point well.  In conclusion, the author supports the exploration of Venus, and is open to finding ways to explore this harsh planet. He believes that the knowledge we would gain from Venus would be very beneficial to the people. He believes that mankind has endured many other harsh endeavors such as the exploration of Venus, and the curosity of mankind will likely lead us to exploring the great hot planet of Venus.  For example, \"At thirty-plus miles above the surface, temperatures would still be toasty at around 170 degrees Farenheit, but the air pressure would be close to that of sea level on Earth\" (5). The author uses this piece of evidence to demonstrate that Venus's conditions are possible for humans to survive, making Venus a serious contendor for space exploration.  In paragraph 7, it says, \"some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface and have lasted for three weeks in such conditions.\" This shows that they are already testing new methods that could possibly survive on Venus. In paragraph 7, it says, \"Another project is looking back to an old technology called mechanical computers...system that use mechanical parts can be made more resistant to pressure, heat, and other forces.\" This proves that they are using all resources that even date back to the 1800s.  Paragraph 4 states, \"Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system. Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth\" (The Challenge of Exploring Venus). If Venus could've supported human life long ago, it is likely the planet still can. The scientific facts throughout this statement support the author's claim by having a reliable source of information, supporting the idea. Paragraph 4 reads, \"Today, Venus still has some features that are analogous to those on Earth. The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters\" (The Challenge of Exploring Venus). Venus already has Earth-like landscapes and other similar formations. This supports the author's idea of exploring Venus because it is so similar to Earth, the chances of survival are higher than any other planet.  Compared to current conditions of Earth, Venus does not possess the necessary qualities that would make it a valuable reserve for potentially sustaining human life forms.  He also states that, \"Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life.\" But there is nothing that follows it that claims what happened or could have happened to cause high pressures, high temperatures, and a high level of carbon dioxide to form.

If students could be educated the way they would want to be educated, yet still get the knowledge they need to succeed, then the future generation could be unstoppable. In paragraph 9 it states that \"making faces can reveal so much about the science of emotions.\" There are no limits to what the next generation can do if it all starts with teachers being able to read the emotions of their students. The future starts here with this idea, and this software.  The highly inteliigent Facial Action Coding System a valuable asset for students in a classroom, as it fosters an enjoyable and captivating learning environment that will shape the students' commitment to school. This advanced software analyzes the movement of a human's facial muscles, comparing it to an emotionless one, and determines the percent distribution their feelings. This innovative software provides students with the ability to customize the pages and lessons on the computer, giving them control over their method of learning. Students with this ability will feel captivated by their learning, as they are in control and can decide how they learn. The development of a desire to learn is crucial for school-aged children so that in the future, they will continue on to further educate themselves and expand their knowledge. This facial  -analysis technology provides schools with the ability to create a captivating learning environment for students that will motivate them to stay committed to their education and reach their goals. While this new technology provides a bounty of benefits to many, assisting students in the achievement of their hopes and dreams holds the most value.  According to the article \"Making Mona Lisa Smile,\" there is a new technology called the Facial Action Coding System (FACS) that enables computers to identify human emotions. This technology is relatively brand new. It creates a 3-D computer model of all fourty-four major muscles in the face that move like human muscles as well. Then, psychologists have classified six basic emotions that are associated with different movements in the facial mucles. This new technology could result in many benefits in our community as well as all around the world  The implications of technology that can detect emotions simply by reading the muscles in the face sound truly remarkable. The thought that one can tell what another is thinking simply by plugging data or maybe even a picture into an algorithm sounds like fiction, but may soon be a reality. The article, \"Making Mona Lisa Smile\" by Nick D'Alto briefly discusses the possible use of such technology in a classroom. The system could examine student's faces, and if they read to be unengaged or uninterested, could adjust the lesson to make learning more interesting to that group of students. That type of technology could revolutionize learning, and customly tailor lesson plans to the feelings of students on any given day.  The author states that scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa when the face appeared. This shows that they have seen things like this before and they knew that it wasn't real, or alien like. Another example that the author proves is that Garvin said it reminded him of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. The camera on board MGS had to peer through wispy clouds to see the face and perhaps alien markings were hidden by haze. Also NASA can be hidding information about the Face. But, you can see that the Face is formed by shadows, and not an alien haze.  The people using this technology are doing so many things, \"The process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face;\" So they're not only using 3-D software but also, \"Using video imagery, the new emotion-recongnition software tracks these facial movements.\" The people who are specializing in doing this kind of technology, are branching out in very large, and impactful ways. Many students could be interested in doing this, and sometimes if it's not in school and they don't hear of it. They can never find it.  So now what do you think? Computers advance more and more everyday, however facial recognition may just be the beginning. Learning in classroom has become based on all technology in many different forms. Facial tachnology will broaden our horizons with better test scores and happier students that can understand the material evn better than before! The use of technology to read the emotional expressions of the students in a classroom could be a life changing improvement in the 21st century since every student has different wants and needs as far their education.  New technology is being introduced to mankind almost every second in this world, and now, the latest techonology is a computer program called the Facial Action Coding System which can identify a person's emotions. The question is whether this technology is actually valuable and for what it could be used for. Experts suggest this technology could be used in a classroom to identify the state of mind of a student to adjust the lesson they are trying to comprehend. But, even though this technology may be helpful to teachers trying to keep students active and engrossed in their lessons, the question arises of whether this techonlogy is actually worth the recources or whether what experts think is a great idea is actually an invasion of privacy.  Nowadays, technology and science became one of important parts in human life, it makes life runs easier. With human's intelligent, technology is improved day by day. Many things are dicovered, or invented that we don't even know about their appearances. One of them is the Facial Action Coding System also known as FACS, which technology could identify human emotions was created by Dr. Paul Eckman.  There is so much wasted potential if the system is put into a classroom.  we could use this technology for bigger and better things. For instance better facial recognition security systems so it can be more accurate reading faces and does not open or let in anyone that looks like the person. Or lock the person out of anything that is protected by facial recognition. Another example of how this could be useful in other ways is the facial recognition can be used in the police force to find a match of a person that was caught on camera to be tracked down and captured.

The electoral college should be abolished. It has caused nothing but problems for us in the past years. From ties, to innacuracy of votes, to causing re-counts. The electoral college is not putting America in the right direction. Most people don't like change, I am one of those people. Although, this change is for the better. And it should be strongly considered in the comig years  In conclusion, the Electoral College should be replaced by the popular vote system as soon as possible. The Electoral College relies on archaic methods to make tallying votes simpler for the government, which results in problems. It's like the government is rounding the votes. The winner-takes-all method of the Electoral College can render a voter's vote completely useless, and it even allows representatives to vote for the presidential candidate that is against the voter's wills. Presidential candidates will not bother campaigning in states that are loyal to their adversary or are too small to be worth their time. While a single person's opinion might not seem important, or rounding votes seems \"easier,\" no corners should ever be cut when deciding who the leader of a nation with over 50 million citizens is, which is why the Electoral College should be replaced by the popular vote system.     Thus, the Electoral College is completely unfair to voters, and should be abolished. Voters should not have to vote for other votes which could very well defy their's, why not just have the Electoral Cllege do all the voting then? It is both redundant and unfair.     It should also be removed because its simply unfair to the voters. There votes may or may not be counted  In conclusion, we should abolish the Electoral College in order to encourage more people to vote and to stop a catastrophe that is bound to happen soon. Acorrding to a Gallup poll done in 2000, over 60% over the American people would rather have a popular vote. This just prooves that the Electoral College is unfair, outdated, and irrational.   In conclusion, the senator should change the voting system for many reasons. First, the popular vote is more reliable and there will always be a winner. Second, the electoral college has an even number of votes meaning there could be a tie therefore ruining the election. Finally, most people would like to personaly vote for theyre president rather than someone else to do it for you. These simple reason suggest why the senate should change the system.       \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  In conclusion, the electoral college needs to be extinguished for many reasons. those reasons are because it doesn't let the people vote for who they want and it over rules a notions votes. And because it doesnt show the number of votes as equall. Some may say that it is good because it prevents a tie but if there is a tie then I'm sure htere are better ways to revote. we need government for the people, by the people and that isn't what the electoral college is.    Reasons number 3 and 4 both contradict reason 2 as well, stating that everybody gets a vote, only swing states should get a vote, and only bigger states should get a vote (even when there is a 51/49 split, where 51%=100%, mind you).  The last reason, why we should change over to election by popular vote is because of the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote. ",

                "content": "Community service should be a choice, not mandatory. Sometimes students serve the community with the little things they do every day, like RELATIVE_NAME's challenge says. Clubs and organisations are important to a student too and with community service around there would be no time. Some students might not even do the service at all. And it takes too long which may result in sleep loss. I hope you take my views into consideration.  In conclusion I feel that students should have to do community service.  What they \"need\" or want to do probably isn't as important as giving back to the community. The community service does not have to conflict with the students life outside of school; it can be as short as one or two hours. Which is why students have no reason why they shouldn't help.      because it can almost be treated like a field trip where students will be brought to a designated location where clean up is necessary and the students will clean up the roads and fields to have better land and less global warming because of the littered trash.  This form of community service would be easy because it would take less than two hours, so the kids can leave the school and come back in the blink of an eye.   I think if you want to do more than 24 hours of service, go right ahead that would be even better.  If 1,000 students each help out for a day, that would be 24,000 hours of community service!  That could make a huge impact in our community.   It doesn't even take long to clean there stalls if you keep up on the work. There is also sometime between pickups of the animals for yourself, or for playing with friends in the empty hold after animals have been delivered. Delivering the animals is always fun, seeing the smiling faces of the little kids riding there first horse, seeing there first cow, or anything else. It's guaranteed to bring a smile to your face.  What these kids are saying is, on a rough estimation, in 3,600 hour school year the don't have just 10 hours of that time to give back to their community? I find that pretty hard to believe, and I hope you would to. I have to agree that students lives are very full these days, but the can make time for their community that makes there lives full. On my opinion on refusing to do community service is either the person is lazy, or just plain mean. The students may not realize it not, but community is definitely worth their time. After doing community service, the students will have a satisfying feeling, knowing they did something good, and benefited their community. You never know, they just might like community service.   i think that everyone should be required to do community service at least once a week.  it would be unfair if the people who are working constantly their whole week have to then perform community service after their long and hard week behind and a new one imminently coming. while it is completely fair for the slacking and un working people to take time out of their day to help their community  I believe everyone should be required to do at least 24 hours of community service each year.  That's adds up to only one day of your 365 day year.  For example, two schools in an area have their 8th grade students do at least an hour of community service a day. Eventually, people would forget how nice it is because it would become a usual thing around the town. This shows that if everyone in 8th grade performed community service daily, or even weekly, citizens would view it as the students doing what they need to do, rather than how nice those students are.

While the author did accurately present the dangers and solutions for the dangerous parts of exploring Venus, they failed to create a strong thesis. The author exceeded when giving factual information about the topic to help the reading get on their side of the arguement; do to them struggling to get across their position on if Venus exploration is worthwhile, some of the provided information they gave was not used to it's full potential when changing the reader's opinion.  Everybody wants their advice to be credible and not bogus, so they seek out different websites, books, and people. If a person was having an argument and says that Alexander Hamilton was the best Founding Father and wanted to know more about him, they might go watch the musical,  Hamilton . That is just one source, so they decide to read a biography about him. The person decides to go on History. com to research more about the Founding Father, and even visits New York City, the place where Hamilton lived most of his life. The person decides that that is enough information and is satisfied with what they have learned. They know all the information is credible because of all the primary and secondary sources they have used and declares that Alexander Hamilton was the best Founding Father. Credibility is really important when it comes to making a decision and can be difficult when there are many different sources to choose from.  a great reason for going to another opinion for help is the fact that they won't sugarcoat the truth from you.  Talking to someone to get an outside opinion could help because this person doesn't know all parts of the story or maybe doesn't know everybody involved personally. This is helpful because they have no sense of bias on who is involved and what is happening in the situation. This person isn't going to sugar coat their words and tell you the truth even if it's something that you don't want to hear. They may simply listen to what you have to say and will already be ready to introduce to you new opinions and will help you look at it from\u00a0a different perspective. They may tell us the truth to address the things we may be avoiding in the situation such as something that is right or wrong. This helps us because sometimes we need to hear the truth to see why we are right or wrong in these situations. By hearing the truth and possibly getting advice to move forward you get to move forward with all your facts laid out.  people had many reasons to believe what they believed. Michael Malin had to find out the answer and find out what exaclty made it. That's exaclty what he did. He found out it was just a landform that resembled a face.  Overall this article's information and research was great and really did inform me about the planet, but the conclusion ruiened it all. The whole time (paragraphs 1-7) the author lead all the readers to believe that going to Venus has too many dangers and isnt in our best interest, yet the conclusion stated that going to Venus would be a great oppurtunity and that \"Our travels on earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation\". If the passage had evidence all throught that going to Venus is beneficial, it would be a perfect article but i was all around confused when I found out the author was all for going to Venus and it ruiened and confused the whole article.           as he gives only one vague reason to explore it,  Mark, or as most people know him Markiplier, is a famous Youtuber who has over 10 million subscribers and specializes in gameplays and some acting skits. He has shared his story multiple times about how he almost graduated from his engeinering career in college based on a complex but effective way of cheating the university's online grading system, which brings up the example of the potential abuse of online lessons  In the book, \"The Great Gatsby,\" Nick was able to find a new found trust for John upon receiving the information that they attended the same war together. This shows how John shifted from some mysterious guy to a possible trusted friend, all because of a personal connection. Schools offer this same opportunity with students and teachers, but online classes eliminate this opportunity. The online connection of a student and teacher is significantly reduced due to never seeing them or having any personal interactions  He does not support this idea throughly, giving limited information to convice the reader of his claim. He only says it can last in challenging conditions for a limired amount of time, but does not mention any support, leaving silicon carbide as his weakest support on how using that, can convice people that Venus is a worthy pursit depsite the dangers it possesses. He uses only one fact, but not not give enough anaylsis to make his argument strong or very clear. ",

Knowing myself, all I want to do when I get home is eat, and of course, sleep. Being lazy leads to weight gain. Many students my age care about how they look to others. You have to be \"skinny\" to \"fit in\" or \"thick\" for boys to like you. It's always good to stay in shape and after school activities may help you with that. Doing what you love makes you more energized. Most clubs have fundraisers you can volunteer for and contribute too. You can stay up at night planning about it, making up cool ideas that'll keep you awake. Overall, no student should just sit at home, doing nothing but eating, if they have a choice to join a club.  On the other hand, some argue that students will use the distance learning less as a tool, but more as a crutch, so that they don't have to attend classes and can stay home whenever they want. People believe that the longer that students are required to show up and are given less options to make it up at home ,the more drive to show up at school will be seen.  We also have to go home and do some choirs, foils some laundry, take a shower, and eat. That to takes up another hour, lets add it up 8 hours at school 2 hours at sports 2 at community service (which is what you want)  +  1 at home...  _____________  That's already 13 hours of the day, and who knows, maybe someone had more things to do, like sports out of school, or scouts, or dance. The possibility are endless and adding this could makes someone day could make it torturous. This also leaves us no down time to read, relax, or watch T.V.  Some students may want to go straight home from school to go eat and take a nap. Also when some students are testing all day they may want to go home and relax. However if the principal forces students to participate in extracurricular activities then they will be even more exhausted by staying after school for the clubs or sports. Some students may not want to stay at school for an extra 1 to 3 hours just for a extracurricular activity. students may have made plans to hang out with friends or go out to the mall. However if they are forced to stay after school then they would have to change their plans. This is another reason why the principal should not force students to participate in extracurricular activities.  Taking classes at one's home would distract students physically and mentally, making it difficult for them to be totally immersed and invested in what they are learning. Even if it is unintentional, a student will rush through their coursework in order to move on to something else more interesting; like playing basketball, watching a movie, or even just eating lunch. In a traditional school setting, class schedules keep students and teachers alike focused on the task at hand. Similarly, it gives them a clear time to take much needed breaks. An environment dedicated to learning lets students know that, when they come to school, it is time to learn. This separation of work and play is much more productive than working at home. So much happens at home. People eat, sleep, hang out with friends and family, cuddle with pets, have good conversations and bad conversations; the list goes on and on. Trying to do work in an such a busy and dynamic environment makes it hard for a learner to dial their brain into the current task at hand. A school environment dedicated to learning makes it easier for a students brain to focus and function.  If a students life consists of just wake up, eat, watch a lecture, do the work, eat, go to sleep, then they miss out on human interaction other than their direct family for nearly eighteen years. That is absolutely not an ideal trade for the luxury of learning from home.   The safest place on earth for anyone on earth is their home, you eat, sleep, and live in your home so why should you not learn there too? Schools used to be the traditional option for learning and education but with students becoming a danger to one another and teachers finding it difficult to deal with certain students its seems as though the system is falling apart. Home schooling is one of the options that many parents are choosing to use as an alternative and this is with good reason. Home schooling is more student-centered than public education and can groom a student differentlly depending on the program  Students would rather talk to their peers than learn but when choosing to learn at home the student is making the executive decision to focus on his/her schoolwork therefore, they will control their surroundings and create a distraction free learning space for the most effective learning experience within their own home. Students can utilize the teachers in the way that school was originally intended without having to wait on a classmate to finish asking a teacher a question or wait till the teacher is finished helping the other students. Since students can learn from their own homes they can eat whenever they would like to and never have to really leave the classroom or stop for a lunch break. The liberty to customize a learning space allows the student to create a space that can be the most preferred and visually appealing to enhance overall brain activity and creativity.  Her family has decided to let her do online school , and has helped her so much because while being at home eating and also going to doctor appointments she has the option to do her assignments online and also sometimes some teachers come to her house do homework assignments with her that help her a ton.

My overall thought on becoming a Seagoing Cowboy is amazed by all the good you would be doing for the world.  The Seagoing Cowboys program is a fun experience in many ways.  Hi, I'm Luke Bomberger. I was a Seagoing Cowboy. You might be pondering what that is, and if you are, I will inform you. Seagoing Cowboys help animals, mostly horses, donkeys, cows, and mules, that are being shipped overseas to avoid harm get to their destination. Are you thinking that you maight like being part of this program?  I loved the opportunity to become a seagoing cowboy, even if it was for a short period of time. I was able to learn animal body language and more about how to take care of the animals. I was able to see many great things like the castle in Crete and the Panama Canal. I also learned about culture in many other countries and some of the hardships of living there. The trips made me more aware of the hardships every person in other countries face every, single day of their lives. I hope that all of these reasons convinced you to become a seagoing cowboy.      While I was in the Seagoing Cowboys program I made nine trips it was the most of any Seagoing Cowboy it was great. I saw so many amazing places I thought I would never be able to see because I was just a normal person in my town. I saw Europe and China while I was in the program it was a great experience for me as a almost adult. I also had the advantage of taking a gondola ride in Venice,Italy, it was the city with the streets of water. I also had a awesome chance at touring the excavated castle in Crete and marveled at the Panama Canal on my way to China in the Seagoing trip. You should join it so you can see all those amazing places I just stated to you that I have seen because of this amazing experience in the Seagoing Cowboys. Another reason you should join it is because if you are almost 18 and you do not want to get military drafted then join this, they count it as your service or they did for me which means they will for you. Another one is after the animals get dropped off and we are going back with no animals we get to play amazing games in the stalls that the animals were in like baseball and volleyball, we also played table-tennis tournaments or even boxing.  These are all the amazing things i got to do and see, you could see and do them to if you join Seagoing Cowboys.  When I was a Seagoing Cowboy, it opened up the world to me. I saw that the world wasn't all sunshine and rainbows, like the little me thought. The world was full of unfairness and was my job, everybody's job, to help stop it. I stepped up to do my part by joining the Seagoing Cowboys. Do your part. Join the Seagoing Cowboys program today. Make the world a better place, one cow at a time. ",

Finally, the fear of more computer based activities is rapidly squashed by the contradiction that being more aware should envoke more human interaction, not lesson it.  Becuase of this ability for teachers to understand their emotions, the quick turn around of revisiting the topic and teaching it a little differently could help the students absorb all the information, especially the information that they mau have not conprehended initally.  It is able to distinguish individual expressions such as happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness which humans can find hard to do making it vital to being infused into the use of schools.  It is very hard for anyone to tell someone they are sad. This is especally true when they barely know the person they are talking to. This can be the case for school councelors and the children they are meeting with. FACS may be able to help.  With the constant evoultion of the way we learn, its not suprising that something like FACS was created. Emotions have been with everything living since the beginning of time. Before FACS, it was suprisingly difficult to read these emotions in people. Such a crucial part of our everyday lives could be easily hidden away by a fake smile or a theatre tear. But now that there is FACS helping out, looks are no longer decieving.  Every human makes a mistake at some point in his or her life. Whether they are distracted by something they see or they fall asleep at the wheel, people will make errors; it is part of our nature. On the other hand, computers function on data and do not make nearly the amount of mistakes as people.  With this in our cumputers it can read the emotions of students better then the teacher ever could and can get the learns more focused and smarter.  While there are many positives to this technology some might argue that computers cannot actually calculate human emotion. They argue that human emotion is not somehting that can or should be understood because it would ruin the entirety of feeling certain ways.  Lastly, if the physical problems of the technology have not already been offputting, then maybe the moral problem of this technology will sway opinions against using it in a classroom. If this technology really can \"indicate the difference between a genuine smile and a forced one\", then this means it can invade people's privacy and indicate an emotion which a person is trying to hide.  Dr. Huang is talking about how it can change the ads you see and veiw if you dont look happy when you look at them. Dr. Huang states \"For example when a web ad appears on your screen and you smile a similar ad may follow, But if you frown the next ad will be different. A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,\" Dr. Huang predicts. This Quote and prediction of Dr. Huang states that is has potential to keep students intrestred into work ",

        "query": "The electoral college is a process, not a place. The electoral college process consists of the selection of the electors. The electoral college consists of 538 electors. In the 23 Amendment of the constitution, the district of columbia is allocated 3 electors and treated\u00a0 like a state for purposes of the electoral college. For this reason, in the following discussion, the word  state  also refers to the district of columbia. Next, each canidate running for president in your state has his or her own group of electors.  The electors are generally chosen by the candidate's political party,but state laws vary on how the electors are selected and what their responsibilities are.  The president election is held every four years on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. Also, most states have a  winner-take-all  system that awards all electors to the winning presidential canidate . However, Maine and Nebraska each have a variation of  proportion representation .  Abolishing the electoral college! But don't worry they're not alone; according to a Gallup poll in 2000, taken shortly after Al Gore.  Thanks to the quirks of the electoral college, which won the popular vote but lost the presidency, over 60 percent of voterswould prefer a direct election to the kind we have now.  Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president.  You might not know this so if you dont here is something very interesting for you to know. Who are the electors? Well they can be snoyone not holding public office. Here's something eles you might know, Who picks the electors in the first place? well here's the answer it depends on the state. The single best argument against the electoral college is what we might call the disaster factor.  The American people should consider themselces lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century; the system allows for must more. consider that state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors, and thats those electors could always defy the will of the people. Black in 1960.  Perhaps most worrying is the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote. In that case, the election would be thrown to the hose of representatives, where state deegations vote on the president. ",

Each candidate running for President in a state has their own group of electors. After each election, the governor of your state prepares a certificate presenting all of the candidates that ran for your state. As stated in the article by the Office of the Federal Register, \"The Certificate of Ascertainment also declares the winning presidential candidate in your state and shows which electors will represent your state at the meeting of the electors in December of the election year.\" The Electoral College is what mantains everything professional.  In order to understand the flaws in the electoral college, you need to know what the electoral college is, and how it came to be. \"The Electoral College process consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for President and Vice President, and the counting of the electoral votes by Congress.\" (Office of the Federal Register 2). This system was created by the founding fathers as a compromise between the congressional vote and the popular vote. However there was a reason for this new, seperated voting system. During their time the founding fathers where among the most educated men in the country. Back then education was not standard and very few people could read or write. The founding fathers did not want uneducated citizens voting on the individual who would lead the country. So they created a system where the uneducated would vote for a group of educated men, who would in turn vote on a president. Thus the electoral college was born.  The Electoral College has served us for more than a century in determining our nation's new president. \"The Electoral College process consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for President and Vice President, and the counting of the electoral votes by Congress,\" states the article \"What Is the Electoral College?\" written by the Office of the Federal Register. This means that we do not vote directly vote for our new president, but instead vote for electors that vote for a candidate running for office. Though many individuals are in favor of keeping the Electoral College, if kept, it will continue to cause problems in our nation.  The electoral college process consists of selecting electors, as you know, but those electors do not always vote for their partie's candidates like they should. This process causes the popular vote to not always guarantee pesidency to a certain candidate even if they have the popular vote. In 2000 Al Gore had won the popular vote but lost presidency because of the electoral college. Not only did one inncident occur but multiple occur because of the electoral college. As stated in paragraph 11 of Bradford Plumer's article, in 1960 segregationists in Louisiana's legislature almost succeeded in replacing Democratic electors with new electors who opposed John F. Kennedy so if Kennedy got the popular vote he wouldnt have got the presidency. Like Bradford Plumer clearly stated \"the electoral college is unfair outdated and irrational.\" The electoral college should be abolished so that problems can be eliminated and elections are fair.  The Electoral College is not a place but a process. The Electoral College process consists of the slection of the electors.  Every four years, citizens of the United States ages eighteen and up, gather at local voting locations to elect the President, our government leader. From Washington to Obama we have always elected our leaders as such. The Constitution has given us our way to vote- the Electoral College. This process, of course, consists of our 538 electors, the place where they meet to vote, and the counting of said votes. But how effective is this process?  When the Constitution of the United States was written our founding fathers decided on an Electoral College as the way to ellect the president instead of a direct vote. The Electoral College is a process that makes a compromise between the popular vote of the citizens and the Congressional vote. When citizens vote for president they are actually voting for a member of the Electoral College that is going to select their president, rather than the citizens voting for the president themselves. The Electoral College is made of 538 electors, the number of electors from each state varies depending on the states Congressional delegation. Washington D.C. is counted as a state for this process and alloted only three electors.  \"Do you want to be apart of a Electoral College\"  Electoral colleges. Do you know what this means? An electoral college is a process of multiple facts. Not a place. As everyone thinks Electoral College sounds decieving because the word \"college\" in the name but apparentley thats not true. The founding fathers established it in the constitution as a compromise between election of the President and votes by the people of America. Dear Senator, this is where I begin rambling on and on about how the electoral college is wonderful and great. But I am just going to let you in to alittle bit of knowledge behind the thinking, before you get your fingers in a knot.  In the article, \"The Indefensible Electoral College: Why event the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong,\" Bradford Plumer quotes, \"Under the electoral college sytem, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president.\" This is not how a republic is supposed to run. People are supposed to be granted the opportunity to elect the president of their choice, not of somebody elses. The most popular vote would take into consideration of every citizen's opinion with a direct percentage of votes to elect a certain candidate. In the article, \"In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President,\" Richard A. Posner states, \"The Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal. No region (South, Northeast, etc.) has enough electoral votes to elect a president.\" This may be true but if the most popular vote system was put into place, there would be an even more exact number of how many people voted for each candidate. The Electoral College does not voice the opinions of all citizens because in reality, a person is not directly voting for their desired candidate. They are voting for other representatives that will hopefully, in turn, elect the candidate they want. Obviously, the Electoral College is definitely a system that should be abolished in the United States of America.  The Electoral College is a process not a place. When the founding fathers established it in the Constitution as a compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and also a popular vote of approved citizens. ",

So in conclusion it is not a alien made face it simply in a mesa or a landmark on Mars. The proof is in the article when you see the 3 picutes that were taken to prove it wasn't a alien made artifact. No matter how cool it would be if it was not to mention that it could make NASA famous or rich it just doesn't have the proof you need to be a alien artifact. If you look more into the passage it even says it was not a alien made artiffact. Yes this face was very famous it even says \"The \"Face\" on Mars has since been a pop icon. It has starred in a Hollywood film, apperered in books, magazines, and even radio shows.\" (5). See how famous that face was 25 years ago is amazing but it still doesn't mean it was a alien made artiffact. So in final say it is not a alien made face and nor will there be enough proof its just a landmark on Mars that was very popular to people everywhere!            It does look like it could be from another living organism, but it's just a rock on the planet. In our newest image of the rock, it turns out that the face has dissapered. There is no evidence of this being created by aliens, rather it was created by wind and water that has been found on Mars. The reason you might believe that this was indeed aliens, might be the fact that the news has blown it out of poportion. It's just the rock that had some interesting shadows and holes that made it look like a human face.  There you have it. The Face sadly wasn't built by aliens, it was just a natural landform that happened to have some pretty neat features to it due to shadows. There is no way around it, because the pictures don't lie. It is even more obvious that it is a landform because ones just like it exist on Earth! Even though it would've been very interesting for it to have been actually created by aliens, it was just a natural landform in the end.  In 1976 the face looked like a face. In 1998 it started to not look like a face at all. In 2001 it just looked like a rock. So i believe that it was not created by aliens but that it was just something the olanet had made itself. This has certainly got the attention of the people.  The \"Face on Mars\" is not a face. If you look at the pictures from 1976, and 1998, and 2001 and in the text it says that the photo from 2001 is the most recent photo that NASA has. It still looks nothing like a face so since the 2001 picture is the most recent it shows that it is just a natural landform. It is just a natural landform. On Mars there are natural landforms everywhere and the fade away. Here on earth natural landforms are created everyday.  I believe the image of the Viking is just a landform and it wasn't created by aliens. I will explain to you why i think it's a landform.  Aliens never made the Face of Mars and the Face of Mars isn't real at all! It's just a natural landform by having the shadows covering up most of the landform making it appear as a face. For the conclusion, Cydonia has a natural landform on it that appears itself as a face using the shadows to make the illusion.  I find it highly unrealistic that NASA would even have been able to determine what the Face was forty years ago, much less hiding a discovery of extra-terrestrial life that could make a huge profit for the space program. And, had NASA really claimed that the Face was an object built by otherworldly life, surely someone would let the cat out of the bag. Not to mention that, if the vast majority of NASA believed it was an alien monument, do you really think that they would wait eighteen years to investigate the subject again? On top of all of this, it's simply illogical that aliens would create such a thing. As far as we all know, the supposed \"aliens\" on Mars have never come in contact with a human, much less seen one. That only leaves possible explanation; aliens created a monument that of which coincedentally resembles a human head. An absolute coincedence.  The author states that scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa when the face appeared. This shows that they have seen things like this before and they knew that it wasn't real, or alien like. Another example that the author proves is that Garvin said it reminded him of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. The camera on board MGS had to peer through wispy clouds to see the face and perhaps alien markings were hidden by haze. Also NASA can be hidding information about the Face. But, you can see that the Face is formed by shadows, and not an alien haze.  About twenty-five years ago, something happened around Mars. NASA, snapped photos of the object. On Mars, there is a face printed on the plant. People think it was created by aliens. NASA said it was created on it's own. Scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa. Those are common around Cydonia. A couple of days later NASA saw a nose, eyes, and a mouth. ",

Without the second policy, students' grades will drop lower and lower because they are not learning what they need to. This is just one more reason why the only way to go is to ban phones in schools at all times.  We all know that this is already a big problem here. If the new rule is made, the no cell phone rule wont get any 'better'. In fact, the problem will just slowly get worse until texting in class gets out of hand. If cell phones are allowed in school just during lunch, it could be in one kid's mind thinking, \"If its allowed at lunch, then the teacher wont be so strict on texting in class.\" Once one kid starts flipping out the cell phone in class, other people will catch on and turn on their mobile devices too. In a matter of months, it could lead to more detentions, more suspensions, and more angry parents. So think, what is the positive of having cell phones even at lunch?  As a current student in middle school, I have learned how children use cell phones. If you are reconsidering the cell phone policy, I believe the second one is the only way to go. Children in this school may sneak their cell phones into class without the teacher ever knowing if they are not banned. This will also lead to students doing poorly in class because they won't be paying attention to the teacher. Also, the use of cell phones in a wrong way can cause a student to get hurt. Overall, I believe your second policy to ban cell phones in class is the best choice because after being a student in school, I know what will happen if they are allowed in school.  If cell phones were allowed during classes, instead of only during lunch periods and other free times, they would be put to use constantly. Students would be able to communicate through text message throughout the classroom, and the teacher would never know. If a student had an Internet connection on his/her phone, they would be able to play games, go on websites that are not allowed in school, and so on. This would all take place right under the teacher's nose, but they would have no way of knowing what was going on. This could be a serious problem for a student's education too. Since cell phones are such a distraction, Students could miss important lessons taught that day, and may fall behind.  Lastly, you wont have teachers complaining about their students not paying attention in class due to the fact that the students are always on their cell phones. Most teachers have to stop the lesson because they have to waste their time taking students cell phones away.  Also, if cell phones weren't allowed in school and teachers really cracked down on the new rule, it would stop kids right in their tracks from attempting to get their cell phones out while they're learning about the Louisiana Purchase. Overall, this rule would set a great example for kids and teach them that cell phones are a distraction and lead you out of school. This would be a win-win situation.  For example if we could have our cell phones out nobody would be thinking of the lesson or would even bother to tune into the class because obviously a phone is a perfect way to chat with your friends while the teacher isn't looking. This makes it difficult for the person sending the messages AND the one receiving them because both are having their attention pulled away from what's important (class) and what's not (socializing). Another example is even if the rule says that cell phones can only be used during free time students will be using them all the time ignoring the rule. Honestly anybody can quickly put the phone under the table and text a quick message to their friend but in that short second the teacher could've been explaining something crucial to the development of the students skills. And just missing that one little thought the student is now behind because of it. As you can see cell phones will be a major disruption to the students if allowed for them to have them in school.  First of all, if students have cell phones then they will be tempted to use it and might get in trouble if they use it in class secretly because they are not allowed to use them in school  . Lets say that students are in class and they feel the urge to text because they have not used the phone that day. They will want to use it in class but they will do it secretly so the teacher wont take it away. For example there was this kid in my class and while we were in the middle of the lesson he would take out the phone while the teacher had her back to us and start using it. If you put the policy that will let us use our cell phones in school during lunch periods and free time then we will have enough texting done so that we will not need to text anymore until school is finished or until their next free time.  For example , we need to forces on more important things such as school work and maybe after school activates. I think we shouldn't be able to have our phones because 50% of students that have cell phones fail there classes because while the teacher is explaining something important the student us either messing around or texting another student which is not only affecting he/she but others around them.

As mentioned in the second paragraph, a majority of people can bring far more reassurance than one person. This can help somebody make better decisions, since there are other people that have examined the situation as their own, and have given thought out advice. As well, it is often a good feeling to somebody, knowing that multiple people acknowledge and care about them. People like when they have not been lied to, because it shows a relationship of trust. Trust can play a big factor, in terms of advice, because a person will not be able to believe other people's ideas, if they can't rely on the person. In conclusion, asking a group of people for advice can lead to different recommendations, an increased sense of relief, and ultimately, making better decisions. At the end of the day, it is important to ask others for advice because people have to make their own decisions. Sometimes it can be extremely hard for people to decide which path to take.  There are times when you need some advice, and a lot\u00a0of it. Asking more than one person is better in many different ways. Some for making better decisions, and some just to hear the opinions of others and what they think is the best thing to do. Someone once said, \"  two heads are better than one\".  when you ask more than one person for advice it can better your understanding because people have had different outcomes with similar experiences, your elders are wiser and can be another option for giving advice, and if you do not have people to support you and give you advice, people in your community and around the world post websites and blogs online.\u00a0Your peers, community, family, and friends are all there to support you and help give advice. No matter how big or small the decision is, someone is always there to help. Before making a life changing choice or decision ask multiple people for advice.\u00a0   \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  Asking someone a simple question like \"Is this good to go?\" can truly impact someone's mindset of how to deal with problems, and can give them strong advice of how to handle the problem they currently have. Multiple pieces of advise would make an even bigger impact on a person and give them more understanding of what others think. Because of this they will be more prepared, and have a different mentality for future problems. From my personal experience, I can relate to having others critic and check my work because I know the helpfulness and understanding I get, can make a real impact on me.  For instance, when someone has an issue and many trusted people believe in a solution, their opinions are almost certiainly the best option. In addition, it can help you find the better solution to have multiple people confirm that it is the best option in the situation.  Different people will have different ideas and options from their perspectives on different kinds of things. It is best to decide whether or not they have the same opinions or ideas, to see if they could bond to make new decisions. Everyone that that person picks from to get advice, could have the same opinions as others or different. Depending on people you trust may have better opinions then those of the people you do not trust. This person might think that the people they do care about or know more, have more ideas to pick from and approve from because they know and trust them most.  Asking advice from multiple people could benefit you in many ways. You have more options, more sources, and more to think about. Even though not every bit of advice you get may work for you, it is important to hear different points of view. Just because you know someone and trust them, doesn't mean they always know what is best for you.  In the end, it is up to you to decide what you listen to. Choose the advice you take carefully, not all of it is there to help you.  when people ask for advice, talking to more than one person can help you make the better choice. You can learn how to make the better choice most suitable for yourself when you talk to people who may have more experience and wisdom than you, and more people will be able to give their own ideas and inputs into the situation to help you look at the decision to be made in many different ways and perspectives. Finally, asking many people what they would do in the same scenario tells you if there might be a clear majority leaning towards one choice. Having a clear majority lets you know that this is what most people would do in the same situation, which leads you to feeling more comfortable and confident after making that decision. Though many people have to make difficult decisions throughout their lives, asking more people for advice in this decision will lead them into making the right one for themselves.  When you know several opinions, you have a better understanding of how others feel about the issue and can reach a general consensus, what the majority of people think, about the topic that you are deciding upon, which can make the correct advice easier to find. By seeking multiple opinions, you can find which ones are poor choices and which ones are ingenious ideas and doing this can make finding correct advice easier. If you seek multiple opinions, you may find out that others have had to make the same decision and had a positive outcome who'se decision you may want to follow. You also may find people who have made bad choices that you would not want to follow. By doing these three things, you increase your chances of finding correct information in the advice that others give you. If you get correct advice by asking multiple people, or if you don't ask anyone and make the wrong choice, you would be on trend mathematically with how many people you talk to, and your result.  Just as if it was math, the current knowledge is to be built on prior knowledge, it's no different for having an opinion. We are heavily influenced by the people around us, such as our parents or friends. When we combine the opinions of others on a situation, we can gather them up to make one solution. It's like adding pieces of a puzzle to make one grand masterpiece, we add the opinions of others to make our own opinion. There are multiple times when I have an opinion on something, such as a hobby, person, or situation and when other's share their opinions on it, sometimes I learn new things from them!

                "content": "The second reason the electoral college should be taken away is that the system has much room for failure. Electors could easily betray the will of the people  The first and foremost reason why the Electoral College should no longer be kept in the U.S is because it will only lead to negative consequences. This has been observed in the past, and it must be prevented from occuring once more. One element of this disaster factor is that electors could defy the will of the people.  The electoral college should be abloshied because it has caused multiple problems over the past years during elections and could continue to cause problems.  Additionally, Richard A. Posner says that \"There are five reasons for retaining the Electoral College despite its lack of democratic pedigree; all are pratical reasons, not liberal or conservative reasons. He then goes on and says, \"A dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is possible...but it's less likely than a dispute over the popular vote.\" In the Electoral College system, their will always be a certainty of outcome.  In an article by Richard A. Posner called \"In Defense Of The Electoral College:Five Reasons To Keep Our Despised Method Of ChoosingThe President\" he states \"there are...reasons for retainig the Electoral College despite its lack of democratic pedigree: all are practical reasons, not liberal or conservative reasons.\"\u00a0 Amongst these reasons one of them is the certainty of outcome and in source 3 paragraph 18 it states that \"A dispue over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is possible-it happened in 2000-but its less likely than a dispute over the popular vote. The reasons is that the winning candidates share of the popular vote.\" Richard Posner is stating that Electoral College is more effective because it causes less trouble and does not need to be disputed unlike popular vote which needs to be disputed because the winning candidiates share of the Electoral college invaribly exceeds his share of the popular vote.  very four years there is an election.\u00a0 The election is used to decide who our president will be for the next four years.\u00a0 The Electoral College is currently being used for our elections.\u00a0 The articles \"Does the Electoral College Work?\" and \"In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President\" by Richard Posner believes the Electoral College should continue to stay in use.\u00a0 On the other hand, the article \"The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong\" by Bradford Plumer believes that the Electoral College should be removed from the system of electing the President.  the Electoral College should be eradicated because it is simply unreliable  The electoral college should not only be abolished, or destroyed, because it causes problems but also because it does not benefit the United States in any way.  After all, electoral colleges should be changed because it is better for the people so there is more of an input from smaller populated states, they will want to vote and there would be less of an ability to tie the election. Having a popular vote lets the citizens in big states that are metaphorically already \"chosen\" allows the minority vote to maybe have a chance in the office. Last but not least, it is understood that having the electoral college decreases wrong-doings, but if the elector chosen by the state changes his intentions just for himself, that gives the state no word about it.     In conclusion, the Electoral College should be replaced by the popular vote system as soon as possible. The Electoral College relies on archaic methods to make tallying votes simpler for the government, which results in problems. It's like the government is rounding the votes. The winner-takes-all method of the Electoral College can render a voter's vote completely useless, and it even allows representatives to vote for the presidential candidate that is against the voter's wills. Presidential candidates will not bother campaigning in states that are loyal to their adversary or are too small to be worth their time. While a single person's opinion might not seem important, or rounding votes seems \"easier,\" no corners should ever be cut when deciding who the leader of a nation with over 50 million citizens is, which is why the Electoral College should be replaced by the popular vote system.

                "content": "By attending class online, students do not have to deal with the daily chores of waking up early, preparing for school, and in many cases rushing to leave in order to not be late. Being tardy for a class can be severely punished even if it was not directly the students fault, which could lower productivity and motivation. It is widely known that students complain about this dilemma\u00a0already, and with online learning, it can be solved in a simple and cost effective way.  Most students attend school with less than 5 hours to sleep due to sleeping late because of homework. Students who have the opportunity to work from home don't have to wake up early. Distance learning allows students to do online courses when they are energized, which doesn't have to be in the morning. This can improve the student's efficiency level and improve their performance. Not all students' physiological needs are met yet they are expected to work with no breaks during school hours. This is due to school hours not being enough for teachers to cover all the content that needs to be covered. Distance learning allows students to take breaks when they feel the need to. Giving students this autonomy can be more motivating to them.  In conclusion, many people will argue that online classes prevent productive learning and it is better just to go to school everyday, this can actually slow down certain peoples education and prevent them from moving forward. If you have a medical problem or are unable to go to school everyday due to sports or work, you should still be able to take online classes that can work around your busy schedule and allow you to get an proper education while also doing your everyday tasks. Though there may be some areas in online classes that bring up questions like whether students will be able to get all their work done from home, there are many ways around these problems that schools should be able to figure out, to make their students educations as good as in classrooms. There are too many benefits to online classes to not consider them. Online classes will change the dynamics of education but they will change them for the better. Students should have a right to to decide whether to go to school and focus on their education in a facility that\u00a0promotes\u00a0learning, students should also have the option to choose whether to take online classes and focus on other aspects of their life like their career or interests.  Attending a class online at home is a great way to stay on pace and not fall behind because all of the information is at the student's fingertips and they can complete their tests and assignments when they are ready and able. They can still also do everything at home while they are sick if they would really like, since all of their materials is already with them on their computer. This way, the student will not fall behind in class, there is less stress, and they won't under perform\u00a0on their exams because they are still able to learn the information they need on their laptop as usual. On the other hand, if a student is sick and cannot go to school that day, they miss all of their class papers and notes from that day and cannot usually make up what they missed. For this reason, online courses are a much safer and reliable way of learning that do not have the stress of missing a full day of information at school. Online courses may also have to be used for every course anyway before long due to the rapid spread and worry over the lethal Corona Virus, which can close schools and put people in quarantine for weeks.  There are a few unfortunate moments in a students day to day life where they stay up late working hard on an assignment that they end up forgetting on their desk, bed, dinner table or anywhere else that is not their backpack. Forgetting to turn in work can hugely affect a students grade, but with the help of online courses, a student can have easy access to their projects and assignments without having to worry about their grade dropping over a simple misplacement. They can have the opportunity to easily locate it and have it by their side once their teacher does any kind of review where the student can also keep up and ask questions, instead of looking around the classroom or peeking at someones\u00a0paper. Also, if students were to have access to their homework and other important projects at all times they are most likely to work on it until, they are able to complete it due to their conscience reminding them that there is work to be done and that the student had a lot more time to finish it.  If a student struggles to balance school, extra-curricular activities, and a job, they would probably find online classes to be very beneficial. When taking classes online, students are usually allowed for more freedom and flexibility. They can sleep in until noon, and then work on a class in the evening. Or if they work to help support their family, they can get up early, get their school work done, and work a job in the afternoon. Most online classes are scheduled similarly to college courses, and will allow students to plan when during the week they wish to take certain classes. My younger sister, who I spoke of earlier, has found this to be very beneficial, and something she will miss once she can fully reimmerse herself into a regular school schedule.  For example whenever I am at home doing my math homework and I am getting particularly bored with it it is very easy to \"take a quick break\". This could mean anything from a two minute glass of water or a five hour nap depending on how I am feeling. So if I took a online course I would have to face this same dilemma\u00a0with every assignment I am given.  Online courses do not give the opportunity for students to ask engaging and purposeful questions to help them make achievements. If students who are participating in taking an online course at home begin to struggle in a course, the lack of communication from someone who is experienced may further complicate that situation; however teachers i school direct students primarily to succeed in the course, and are willing to provide all the help necessary for a student's success. Even if students are taking a course through, for example a video conference, they still are not gaining the same\u00a0help. If a video conference lesson was for a math course, it would be complicated for a teacher to view the mistakes made on practice that a student completed, and directly present to them what they did incorrectly. Teachers roles are to expand and elaborate on topics, so a student is able to gain a full understanding of the curriculum necessary for a test, or a future assessment. Those who are taking a course at home do not gain\u00a0that full elaboration or background knowledge as a student who is receiving in person instruction would.  It decreases the time to finish work at home rather than at school. Most online school programs offer as much time as you need on an assignment. Although, once you've started one there is of course, a deadline. Attending online school at home is very benefitial in this reason because it would make it easier for the student. On that note, if a student were to be having trouble with an assignment online they would be able to turn it in once they have understood it completely or if not the student could move on to another subject and come back to it. That is what makes online school at home very helpful and beneficial. In a classroom that would not be possible, in some cases, they would have no other choice but to turn it when needed to and accept the consequences.  There are students have jobs, have lots of homework, and have emergencies, so online classrooms can benefit these students because online learning can allow the student to work on their own pace. For example, if a student has a death in the family, the student should take time off from school to mourn and attend services. If that student missed classroom taught classes, the learning experience the student missed cannot be brought back since the entire class as whole moves on through a designated schedule, and the student would have much work to catch up on in little time. But, if the student was taking online classes and missed multiple classes, the student would only worry little in comparison to a classroom student. Since online classes allow students to work on their own time, the student with the family emergency can always catch up whenever he is done with his personal business and he does not have to worry about other classmates' progress in the class. That way, online learning can be beneficial to the student. ",

                "content": "Throughout the story the author does list at least one benefit to exploring Venus. In the story he writes, \" it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system.\" Yes i can agree that would be a great reason to explore Venus,  Venus, otherwise known as the \"Evening Star,\" is one of the more challenging planets to examine closely in our solar system. While this plant is often called Earth's twin, it is vastly different in terms of environment and hospitability. Despite being the closest planet to Earth at times, no spaceship has touched down on Venus in over thirty years. The dangers presented by Venus are many, but the author greatly supports the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite these dangers.  These are all questions that need to be considered when brainstoming the idea of visitng another planet. The author of this article is avoiding all of these mainstream problems by simply saying it's worth the risks, when it actaully is not. In paragraph 3, the author explains all of the dangers of Venus and how they can affect humans. He explains, \" On the planet's surface, the temperature averages over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet.\" Considering that this is true, we can definitrly assume that condition on Venus are severly dangerous, and a lot of people may get hurt trying to explore it. The aurthor also states, \" These conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth; such an environment would crush even a submarine accustomed to diving to the deepest parts of our oeans and would liquefy many metals. What the author is stating here is that not even our strongest materials and creations can withstand the conditions on Venus. This means that in order to explore Venus we have to design all new machinery, which would cost a lot of money, not to mention the human costs as we would need humans to test things out. He also makes it notable that venus has the hottest surface of any planet, despite not being the closest to the sun. All of these facts are serious concerns when regarding human safety as well as propr functioning of machines. Even if exploring Venus was a possibilty, would it be even be worth it after all of he human costs and money costs or paid. What we are discussing here is putting human lives at risk, and spending a ton of money on a project that is no where near being ready ready to present. These reasons as well as the provided facts assure me on my claim that the author did a terrible job of supporting this idea of exploration.  I agree with him in this claim because if humans can explore Venus, I also believe we can go on to do bigger and better things with exploring our solar system  People have studied the many planets in our solar system and are fastinated by them. People have also studied the solar system to help explore and give information about the planets around us. One planet that scientists have studied for a good amount of time is Venus since it shows that at one time, the planet might have inhabited living organisms. However, Venus is a very dangerous planet since many attempts of landing spacecraft has failed on Venus and the clouds of the planet are made of sulfuric acid. Venus is not worth the pursuit of knowledge since the planet has a very dangerous enviorment for humans and that not a single spacecraft has landed safely on the planet and returned.  In coclusion, the authors final claim states, \"Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation.\" Although there are many dangers that could seek upon them, they take them as \"challenges\" and are willing to dig deeper to find out why Venus is the way it is. \"Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth- like planet in our solar system.\" Therefore, this is why the author does a good job by suggesting that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents.     When talking about something as dangerous as exploring another planet, it is easy to see that our Earth bound technology simply cannot do the job. in paragraph 5 of the article, the author describes an idea that was thought up by \"The National Aeronautics and Space Administartion\". This idea is to have humans 30 or so miles above Venus for exploration. The author claims how this would be beneficial in keeping humans safe from the Venusian landscape. However, The author does not support this idea well, as he goes on to say how not much exploration can be done from there, and the conditions would still be extremely dangerous but \"survivable\". Also in paragraph 7, the author explains how NASA is working on other approaches to study Venus. He explains how they are working on some simplified electronics, made of silicon carbide, that have been testedd in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface. This may sound like a good thing, but it is far from one. This is because the author finsihes by saying that the electronics lasted only three weeks. If a computer can't withstand Venus's conditions longer than three weeks, I am very doubtful that a human can. This proves my point that our technology is far too inadvanced for such a task like exploring another planet. Therefore supporting my claim that the author did a poor job in supporting this idea.  In \"The Challenge of Exploring Venus,\" the author describes why putting a man on the moon seems like a walk in the park compared to the horrendous obstacles preventing humans from pushing the frontier with visiting one of Earth's neighbors, Venus. The thick atmosphere is toxic to us. The clouds of sulfuric acid, the incredibly high temperatures on the planet's surface, and pressure would present challenges to mankind and its technology.  Overall this article's information and research was great and really did inform me about the planet, but the conclusion ruiened it all. The whole time (paragraphs 1-7) the author lead all the readers to believe that going to Venus has too many dangers and isnt in our best interest, yet the conclusion stated that going to Venus would be a great oppurtunity and that \"Our travels on earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation\". If the passage had evidence all throught that going to Venus is beneficial, it would be a perfect article but i was all around confused when I found out the author was all for going to Venus and it ruiened and confused the whole article.           While providing simple, yet interesting facts about Venus, such as it being the planet closest to Earth's density and size, may be enough to intrigue the audience into wanting to learn more about the planet, the author takes it a step further. The author goes in depth about the possibility of Venus being the most Earth-like planet in our solar system long ago. They detail the planet's environment today, consisting of Earth-like structures such as rocky sediment surfaces, valleys, mountans, craters, and other geological findings. They also state \"Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth.\" This information opens up an entirely new realm of possibilites for the audience to consider, and is more likely to interest them as it directly relates to our life on Earth. The way the author has set up the comparisons of Earth and Venus have allowed the audience to view the exploration of the planet as an opportunity to see a planet that could be like us; a planet with living, breathing forms of life similar to what we see everyday. The author uses this information to encourage the audience to view the pursuit of Venus as a chance to gain information on the things we see in our everyday life, and not just complex ideas that are difficult to understand and most-likely won't affect them.

                "content": "Projects, presentations and intellectual conversations would be removed from the learning realm, and would be replaced with watching videos and staring at a computer all day. Technology has been proven to be unhealthy to adults and especially teenagers. It has rotted our brains, shortened our attention span, and removed our creativity. Our generation has been revolved around technology, and has set the stage for the future. It is no doubt that one day their will come a time when students no longer come to school to talk to their peers and learn from their teachers, but instead learn from robots, in their dark rooms, only lightened by their computer screens and cell phones. Coming to school and sitting in a classroom, where are phones zipped in our backpacks and our laptops shut, is refreshing and healthy for teenagers. With online classroom, students would not be able to take physical education and run in the fresh air, and have a break from the technology they stare at throughout the day. If we were to take online classes from home we would be constantly hovered over our computer screens, diminishing our creativity and forgetting what school used to mean.   In almost all class rooms nation wide there is a similar routine. Learn something, practice it for homework and then see if a student is understanding it by taking a quiz over it. While this may be effective, it can be imporved ten fold with the Facial Action Coding System. The technology could understand emotion of students in present time. A teacher wouldn't have to wait to give out a quiz to see if students were having issues. They could teach the subject and then immediatly know if students are having difficulty unerstanding it. Dr. Huang, the creator of FACS, states that \"A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored\". If teachers are able to recieve this information, their teaching would become more effective. Teachers could change lesson plans in order to fit the needs of the students, and give extra support and help to those children that are still struggling. FACS can also help excite studnets about learning. This is important because no matter how much a teacher trys to help a student, the studnet will not imporve in anything if thet do not want to learn. If computers are able to read if studnets are excited or bored by a lesson, teachers would add visuals and what not to make it more intersesting to a student. This would make them want to learn, not them being required to learn. totality, the ability to be able to percieve students emotions would help students academically by allowing teachers to change lesson plans that allow for more excitment and understand in classrooms.  These basic forms of work require no fragile electronics at all. Using gears, levers, pulleys, and ramrods, corporations have been able to create many devices. When made out of an acid-resistent substance that can withstand high pressure, a mechanical machine may work. The only problem with a mechanical machine is that once on the planet, sure it can do work, but it would be unable to transmit and data findings back to a receiver on a ship or earth. There would be a point where some sort of electronics would be needed. And as of right now, there is not an effective enough invention that could put humans on Venus to live and research.  If there is an error or flaw in your idea, they can point it out so your idea won't contain that flaw anymore. An example is the Apple Company that makes a variety of electronics that people. They don't have just one version of the idea that they made; they have many different types of phones, each coming from different years with different ideas of the ideal iPhone that everyone would like to buy. People give their ideas to the Apple Company, such as having a phone with no home button, having a bigger-sized phone, or even having a brand new product, like AirPods. Many people who ask one person think it can be embarrassing to ask someone if there is anything wrong just to find out there is something wrong, although it doesn't matter if you get embarrassed or not. It matters that you got the mistake from someone and corrected that mistake for the better of the people. In fact, having more problems is better than having none, because that just means you just have some more to work on, and if the first type of your idea doesn't work out, you can always try again and again with your idea until it has reached the best outcome it can possibly receive.  I can just imagine how the near future ahead may look. From time to time I ask my great grandmother questions about the life she had growing up and im always amazed by the comaparison to the life that I live. I have grown up with technology at my fingertips, techonology from the alarm that wakes me up to the music I listen to on my ipod when I go to sleep. Growing up I don't remember getting lost and having to ever ask for direcions when traveling out of state with my family. We simply used our GPS system. I like watching movies on the car when we go places, and I life the rear camara on the car that helps us drive safely. These new techonologies have made our lives much easier and thanks to those bright minds that have created and innovated the techonlogy we have.  As time goes by, we as a society must make progress, and its clear that we have. Along with progress comes some disagreements and possible dangers thanks to time and acceptace from our society we have made great improvements from, lets say the time my great grandma was just a young girl.  Students are often young and their brains have the power to rapidly grasp and process information. However, this ability can be negatively affected especially when the student is in an environment that they are well acquainted with. A well known area where students have limited interactions can dull their curiosity and aspirations for learning, causing boredom. This boredom is able to take over a young student's malleable mind and replace curiosity with distraction. In a world where technology is ubiquitous and can bring the world to one's fingertips, students would much rather research the latest scores of a basketball game or catch up on celebrity gossip, than they would learn about the Pythagorean theorem. At home, a student's mind is able to roam around freely, especially without an instructor prohibiting such distractions. Making it less likely that students are being attentive to the subject being taught on an online forum that limits their participation in the class. Therefore, students will not benefit from attending online classes at home as they will get easily distracted by the comforts in their home.  Back in the 1950's people had to use cars to do eveything. From talking to a friend face to face to going to the nearest resturant. But now you can do all of that in your own living room, due to technology that has advanced us to be able to use Facetime, Skype, or Oovoo to talk to our friends face to face using out phone, tablet, or personal computer. And to drive anywhere we need to we have apps the diliver taxies to our houses for us.\"...the Internet makes telecommuting possible and allows people to feel more connected without driving to meet friends...Likewise the rise in cellphones and car-pooling apps have facilitated more flexiable commuting arrangements, including the evolution of shared can services fro getting to work.\" ( Paragraph 35, Rosenthal)  Working everyday will effect this because no one wants to miss work. Missing work means less money and creates more stress for the person missing work. By saving maybe $10 on gas that day you're missing out on the $125 you could've made by working, but there's another solution to this also. Car-pool! Even if you're driving the car yourself or you're in the car you're saving fule and money.  An example of this can be observed on a daily basis: with the simple accessibility of smart phones, it is now engraved in our culture that using technology to opt out of social situations is acceptable and more commonplace than ever before. This is because our long-term\u00a0un-moderated exposure to technology and its tendency to distract us from meaningful relationships with the people around us, is used as an excuse to limit our own social development. As a technologically-dependent and ever-evolving 21st century society, it would be unrealistic to propose that we halt the development of new technology as a means to preserve basic human interaction. Because these social habits are nearly irreversible on a global scale, an isolated, 100% digitized school environment would only promote the social debilitation of today's adolescent student body.  Today, many humans own and operate cell phones on a daily basis. The introduction of the modern-day cell phone has made life easier. The cell phone has improved communication between individuals despite the distance. Cell phones have also made receiving information easier for the user when lacking understanding on a certain subject. In other words, the invention has made life more convenient, which resulted in dependence on the object. However, there must be a limitation to the usage of the object, especially when using the cell phone at that time can be life threatening. One of the many times that a cell phone should not be operated is while driving.  Sebastian Thrun, founder of the Google Car project, believes that with the technolgy progressing consumers can have a driverless cab take us wherever we would like to go. Along with the sensors the radar will help with the antilock system to make that dream come ture.  BMW has already annouced the development of \"Traffic Jam Assistant\". It's a car the can handle driving up to 25 mph, but touch sensors keeps the driver holding the wheel in case of a malfunction. The human driver must remian alert and be able to take over in certain situations. Manufacturers are also considering using cameras to watch that drivers are remaining focused on the road. ",

                "content": "Another thing that has been changed due to the limitation of car usages is that with individuals not having to buy a car, pay for insurance, and pay for gas, it\u00a0 has increased the amount of money citizens have in their wallets. Citizens of the United States of America have not exactly chosen to not use cars, but some have, the main reason Citizen of America have limited themself is due to a lack of money. During our \"recession\" Americans were \"unemployed\" and \"unable to pay (The end of car culture 32).\" Because citizens were not able to pay for cars, they did not use them, thus as you get adapted to a new situation you tend to stay with it. After the switch citizens who chose to continue a life without a car, were able to have more money because they didnt have to pay for the cost that come with a car.  people all over the world are paying attention to what they can do to help the environment, meaning that this is an advantage that will appeal to a widespread audience. One way that limiting car usage will help is that it will reduce greenhouse gas emissions. In Elisabeth Rosenthal's essay \"In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars\", she writes, \"Passenger cars are responsible for 2 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe ... and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States\". By limiting the usage of cars, the amount of greenhouse gases being emitted into the world would decrease substantially. While the idea that everyone would stop using their cars and the gas emissions caused by them would disappear completely is unrealistic, the prospect that a majority of the emissions could do so is perfectly reasonable. The reduction of these emissions would mean that the air quality would increase and be overall healthier for both all the world's population and all the wildlife across the world. Robert Duffer provides another example of how less car usage would impact the environment in his essay, \"Paris bans driving due to smog\". According to the article, an intense smog had covered Paris for five days, when the city decided to ban car usage over the course of two days. The cause for the smog was thought to be the high use of diesel fuel in France, with 67 percent of cars using it over gasoline, about 14 percent higher than the rest of Western Europe. The plan for the ban had been that cars with even-numbered license plates to not be used the first day and for ones with odd-numbered license plates not to be used the next day. In actuality, cars with odd-numbered plates were never banned from driving since the smog had cleared just after the first day. This shows the impact of limiting car usage. In just one day, a smog that was comarable to the one in Beijing, China, one of the most polluted cities in the world, was removed considerably after just half the normal amount of cars were used over the course of a day. If this was used all over the world, the result would be even more significant. This evidence supports that limiting car use is good for the environment in more ways than one.  As you can see, there are many advantages to limiting car usage, such as, limiting the amount of pollution there is, lowering the risks of getting into, or even causing a wreck, and even something as simple as making it a more peaceful enviroment to live in, not only for yourself, but for others around you. Our world, and daily lives would be affected in great ways, in more cities, and even more countries, participated in lessing the amount of car usage.        \u00a0   All in all, there are many ways to try and cut down on our car usage for the better. It can be anything from not buying as many cars, to deciding to not use cars at all and deciding to walk, skate, and bike, etc. Not only will limiting our car usage as a whole stop traffic jams, car accidents, air pollution, and more, it will help to benefit our lives for the better whether or not people want to believe it. If things keep going from here, and more and more decide that less car usage is better than over a time span of let's say 20-30 years, there could be a lot less dangerous things occuring in our lives.     All in all, there are many advantages that could easily come with limiting car usage, including the reduction of smog and a more pleasent lifestyle for the citizens who decide to limit or cease their auto usage. While transportation issues may arise when people begin to give up their motorized vehicle, or if they decide to not purchase one in the first place, as many already have, a quick purchase of a bike or the use of public transit can solve at least some of them.     Smog, backed up traffic ways, and stress seem to be the main factor contributing to the decrease in car usage. Although these seem to be very negative factors, there are many advantages to limiting car use including helping our Planet Earth and less costly factors.  Although the use of cars may be convienent, the benifits of limiting the usage may be beginning to outweight the inconviences. Between reducing the greenhouse gas creating a cleaner environment as well as lessening stress and making the roads safer, the advantages of limiting car usage in the United States are major.     However, limiting car usage reduces society's carbon footprint, slowly eliminating the encompassing pollution  Around the world, people are going around side by side, without depending on cars like they use to back a couple years ago. Improvements shown in places like Paris, shows how the limiting of automobile usage can greatly impact the envrionment to create a clean atmosphere. Not only would it help clear smog, but it would allow a stress free city from being populated by traffic jams and yelling individuals, who are experiencing road rage thanks to the taffic. A happier environment would be created when people are out rding bikes to places and walking with friends. In cocnclusion, the benifits of limiting car usage are as clear as water, it would reduce smog, promote other forms of transprtation, and would help our culture by creating a happier, cleaner atmosphere to live in.     the reduction of air pollution and smog has become a major advantage in the limitation of car usage.

I dont see why we cant have this vote as a country then there wouldnt be a topic to argue about. The electoral college is a decision that was not in the constitution i believe so it can be removed very easily. My opinion is that we take the electoral college out because it is causing nothing but arguing. We deserve to pick if we want to have a president we want or not. We deserve this power atleast, we dont have any power as regular people we deserve this. They shouldnt have the right to take this away from us  Why do we vote? We vote so we can choose a candidate that we can trust to make the best decisions for our country. But what's the point of voting if we have an Electoral College. We are not actually voting to ellect a president, we are voting for electors, who elect the president.  In doing this you are having a fair vote in the election with everyone who is eligable to vote, voting whomever they please. If you vote for your own president of your choice there will not be any elector deciding for you if they do not like what you have elected. We need to have a say in what we want. I mean if we want someone to be watching over us, and deciding what to do, we want someone who everyine agrees on. Just a few hundred poeoplpe choosing for you is nothing compared to approximatley more than a million people choosing for themselves. In  Source 2 \"The indefensible electorial college : why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong by Bradford Plumer\"  it says that the electors can always defy the will of the people. In my case I believe that no one would want that. I mean, would you want that?  If one wanted to, an elector can completely disregard the decision of the voters and choose who they want. Considering the ratio of electors in some states to people, it seems completely non-democratic for the votes of some to be more important than the wants of the common people. Some start to feel that they shouldn't vote because their one vote wouldn't have the power to change anything, and wouldn't even ensure the election of the president they want. Another thing that lowers the morale is the absence of candidates in states that can't be won very easily. If a candidate is pretty sure he can't win over a state, he won't visit it because it wouldn't be worth his time. He also wil prioritize large states over small ones because they have more electoral votes. All of these can make a state or person feel as if the election isn't really in their hands, and when people feel like their vote doesn't matter, they don't vote.  By , not making their vote count some people can feel that their voices are not being heard which can lead to in some cases riots and rebellions etc. Voting happens for a reason if gives the world a chance to pick whom they want to see lead them and who they feel like is the right person but in the end if there votes cant count and actually go to the electors limits their power and freedom to speak. '' Voters in presidential elections ae people who want to express a political prefeence rather than people ho think that a single vote may decide an election''.(source 3 , p.23). The Electoral College may have worked in the past but now its not working as well.  The public wants to know exactly who and what they are voting for, they want to know exactly what their vote means to the election. More than half of the time they don't notice what kind of an impact a vote can make or what exactly they are voting for. Also when they do elect a President, the end up getting mad over their finances or taxes because the President trhat they voted for affected it in a negative way. They wanted to elect him because they wanted a better economy, to benefit them, not to restrict them from not having what they want.  Men who are running for a spot as a presidental candidate are not voted for by the citizens of that state. They have to gain supporters who then become the electors. Then the people of that state have to vote for the electors, not the person to become a presidental candidate. Voters can't even directly vote for who they want. What if you vote for a slate of electors, who are supposed to be in favor of the presidnetal candidate you want, but don't vote for him? What happens then? Presidental candidates who should actually get a chance at running for president because they didn't get enough electoral votes.  Eeveryone should have a say in what goes on where ever it is that they live. We the people make up the government. Who draws the line that states whether or not you are allowed to vote. We do! Therefore we should be able to decied ourselves who can be our president to the United States of America. It is niot fair that we need to elect others to have our submission be made. Even when we tell our electors who we choose, they might turn arouhd and vote for the other person. In  Source 2 \"The indefensible electorial college : why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong by Bradford Plumer\"  backs up my response when stating,\"In the same vein, 'faithless' electors have ocasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please...\". That to me my friend, is not fair at all.  A lot of voters who are not very well educated may not even understand what the electoral college is or what they are actually voting for when they vote. Instead of voting for the candidate that they want as the next president, they are voting for a group of electors that decide who will win. Sometimes, the electors that are assigned to that candiadate will not vote for them. This process also seems to disriciminate against the less populated states because they don't have as much a say in the college and are often forgoten in the rush of propaganda and aren't really aware of who they should pick and why they should pick them.  What is the point of people voting if they are not really getting a say in who they are really voting for? The Electoral College has a bigger say then the thousands of of people who vote. How can a group of peoples say mean more then thousands of people in the United States. Also, the \"Winner-Take-All\" sytem does not help anymore then the Electoral college does. What is so special about the Electoral College that they get picked specially to make their vote count on who wins or loses the election? ",

Last but not least, the Electoral College is just unfair in so many differnt ways.

Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and the AFL-CIO all agreed on one thing, and it was aboloshing the Electoral College.  Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and the AFL-CIO all agreed on one thing, and it was abolishing the Electoral College.  \"The founding fathers established it in the Constitution as a compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote.\" (the Office of the Federal Register). People must remember that this system is a compromise for the election and that any change could lead to problems among the government again. The public must also remember that \"each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee\".(Richard A. Posner). This system also can often prevent disputes. \"A dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is possible...but it's less likely than a dispute over the popular vote. The reason is that the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College invariably exceeds his share or the popular vote.\" (Richard A. Posner). Along with the fewer disputes, it also creates standards for the candidate. \" The Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal...This is a desirable result because a candidate with only regional appeal is unlikely to be a successful president.\" (Richard A. Posner). Another benefit to this system is that it causes voters to pay closer attention to the election. \"Voter in toss-up states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign.\" (Richard A. Posner). Along with the more aware voters, the Electoral College is also very beneficial to the big states. \"The Electoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states (by population) lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment of the Senate decreed in the Constitution.\" (Richard A. Posner). And lastly, the Electoral Collee helps avoid run-off elections. \"There is pressure for run-off elections when no candidate wins a majority of the votes cast; that pressure, which would greatly complicate the presidential election process, is reduced by the Electoral College, which invariably produces a clear winner.\" (Richard A. Posner). To sum it all up, there are many benefits to the Electoral College.  Back then, presidents wouldn't accept the Electoral College. \"What have Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and the AFL-CIO all, in their time, agreed on? Answer: Abolishing the electoral college!\"  What i mean is \"Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but the slate of electors, who in turn elect the president.\" Americans have always wanted to be in power and have a say in what we do but in the case of voting we do not. By doing this we are allowing the government to make all of the decisions for us, as if we were children. When you turn to the legal age for vothing your vote should count. With this majority does not rule, for instance say our votes of 46 percent and 54 percent were to come in. The man of the 46 percent still has a chance of winning when the people had already voted. The problem with that is at that point the peoples word goes out the window, and the government once again jumps in demanding that they choose. ",

If the law is not enough to persuade people to stop using phones while driving, the dangers of killing people should. Close to five thousand people died due to cell phone related crashes in 2018 (Texting and Driving Statistics 2019, thezebra. com). Even if someone is not on the phone themselves, someone else on the road could be  Cell phones are huge distractions in school. They lead to high school drop outs because of their grades and, not to mention, they lead to low income. If we let students use cell phones more in school they may get the thought they can do whatever they want. We need to put a stop to this now so our future generations will be able to support their families.  In conclusion, don't operate a vehicle while using a phone at the same time because it can lead to some serious consequences. You are not only endangering yourself but your endangering others on the road, as well as passengers, or even any close-by pedestrians. Driving needs complete attention and focus so ensure the risk of any injuries or deaths because driving is very dangerous. Using a cell phone takes away your focus and attention from driving because now you're trying to multi-task which means you're playing with life or lives. Speaking from experience, cell phones should be banned while driving because they slow your reaction time to anything that may be happening around you. Managing a cell phone while driving is now putting you in a life or death situation that you wouldn't want to be put in.    Over all, I believe that banning phones from school is a bad idea. None of the students would follow the rule, and they would just bring them to school and hide them. This will get zero progress, and will create no change in the school environment. If you let students text during free time, it could keep students from texting during class, and help them focus more. By distracting the students while they are outside or have free time, it could prevent them from doing something to get them in trouble. And less people would be angry. You would not have angry students or parents coming up to the school to take back a confiscated item, thus not having to bother with any angry people. This is where I stand on the policies, but the final decision is up to you.  As a current student in middle school, I have learned how children use cell phones. If you are reconsidering the cell phone policy, I believe the second one is the only way to go. Children in this school may sneak their cell phones into class without the teacher ever knowing if they are not banned. This will also lead to students doing poorly in class because they won't be paying attention to the teacher. Also, the use of cell phones in a wrong way can cause a student to get hurt. Overall, I believe your second policy to ban cell phones in class is the best choice because after being a student in school, I know what will happen if they are allowed in school.  You can have criminal penalties placed on you such as fines and tickets and depending on if you had an accident and killed someone you may face more serious criminal consequences such as jail time. Driving with a device can cause you to have higher insurance premiums because insurance rates are tied to a driver's driving history and if you get pulled over for using your phone while driving too many times, it could cause your insurance premiums to spike. Also, you can lose your driving privileges because just like your insurance, you accumulate points for your recklessness. So, if you accumulate too many, you can no longer drive. So, unless your like tickets, fines, jail time, or losing your driver's license, I suggest you wait till you get home to check you phone.  A simple message or text could wait. If people paid as much attention to the roads than their phones there would be less wrecks or car tragedies. Cell phones are huge distractions on drivers. Drivers are put in harm once they pick up their phones to check a text, post on social media, change songs, make videos, and etc. Cell phones while driving is like taking a risk. People are put in life or death situations once being distracted by their phones when operating a vehicle. In conclusion the use of cell phones should be prohibited while driving.     Today in the 21st century , phones have evolved to more of a necessity than that of a want. Almost everyone has phone these days and use it very frequently. Cell phones can be very distracting in every day activities like school , work , and worst of all , driving . The United States 1 out of 4 car accidents is due to driving while using a phone . That's 1.6 million crashes per year ! The use of phones while driving has escalated over the years and it is getting more prevalent  If cell phones were allowed during classes, instead of only during lunch periods and other free times, they would be put to use constantly. Students would be able to communicate through text message throughout the classroom, and the teacher would never know. If a student had an Internet connection on his/her phone, they would be able to play games, go on websites that are not allowed in school, and so on. This would all take place right under the teacher's nose, but they would have no way of knowing what was going on. This could be a serious problem for a student's education too. Since cell phones are such a distraction, Students could miss important lessons taught that day, and may fall behind.  All cell phone users can vouch that having a cell phone comes with understanding that there are a plethora of different applications going on within that minuscule device. Loud notifications from social media sites and vibrating text messages from friends and family, even though they may seem important, are all distractions that come with having a device. When someone is distracted, their reaction time when operating the vehicle becomes impaired which poses a threat to everyone on the road, even if they are just a passenger. If cell phone usage is banned from drivers, it would not be the first time or first \"place\" that cell phone usage has been barred from. Cell phone usage has been restricted or banned from vital places such as school and the workforce. This is all for the reason that it can alter that particular person's effectiveness when trying to conduct or produce work. If cell phones are not allowed in these places because they distract people so greatly, why should they be allowed when someone is operating a car that weighs a few tons? ",

                "content": "He states that Venus is often referred to as Earth's \"twin\". This is because Venus and Earth are close in size, density, and at some points in orbit are the closest planets in the solar system. It is also believed that at one point, Venus was a lot like Earth is now. \"The Challenge of Exploring Venus\" states, \"Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our soloar system.\". The article goes on to say Venus most likely had large oceans that supported life, and the planet has things like craters, valleys, and mountains that we also have here on Earth. The author including these details helps get the point across that Venus is a lot like Earth, and with the little research been done already, we've found so much. This helps readers understand that the longer Venus is studied, the more we will learn about it.  \"Ugh, I wish that I could just stay home and attend my classes online without having to leave home,\" I say to myself at least eight million times during the school day; taking a moment to think about it, I thought maybe this would be beneficial. Today we live in a society in which students attend classes on a daily basis, some who walk across the street to attend class, some who have at least an hour commute to attend class everyday, and some who take online courses, which is very beneficial  The system should not even be here today because it is outdated way past our time.  This might be the hundreth letter opened about this electoral college topic, but this is a very important subject that needs to be run by all of our citizens. Honestly the electoral college is very important because of the fact that after elections after everyone has voted they are the ones that are the electors for the President and the Vice President. Its not like it was made for no reason it was made to make the elections fair, it's not like it's the first time people have wanted to get abolish the Electoral College even many people have wanted to remove this like for example Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, and more but this dosnt mean that it is the right choice. Yes it is agreed that there are some downs to have the Electoral College, plus even the person that the Electoral College votes fo that might not be the person most of the nation choose. Like now in the 2012 elections Obama had more Electoral votes than Romney\"Because almost all states award the electorsl votes on a winner-takes all basis.\"  In 2018, 4,637 people died in car crashes due to cell phone use (The Zebra). That is 4,637 lives that could have been spared if it weren't for the recklessness of irresponsible drivers. In 2002, 62% of people owned regular cell phones, while today, in 2019, about 95% of americans own cell phones. 77% of these modern cell phones owners have smartphones, which can be even more distracting (Pew Research Center). In that time, car accidents caused by cell phone distraction has increased from 6% to 25% of all car accidents (Schlossberg 2002, Miller & Zois 2019). There is a clear correlation between the increased reliance of cell phones and distracted driving accidents. The irresponsible actions of these drivers is causing increased danger on our roads. Leniency cannot be accepted. The law should have absolutely no tolerance for this hazardous driving.  Everybody knows somebody like this in their lives; a homebody, someone who prefers staying home over going out, maybe doesn't have too many friends or has trouble forging bonds and building relationships. You may also call these people recluses, or shut-ins, but either way, you've stumbled across someone who fits this mold. Favorite characters even, like Oscar the Grouch or Angela from The Office, can be used as lovable examples. However, these traits are not always so endearing in a young child.  Cell phone companies such as AT&T realized how big cell phones are distractions to drivers so they come up with programs. For example, a big program today is \" It could wait \". On the site www.independentmotors.com it describes the can wait program. It quotes \"AT&T itself has helped drive these conversations with its It Can Wait campaign, which has seen more than 7 million people take the campaign's pledge to drive more safely. The company also launched its DriveMode app, which keeps all phone calls and texts quiet while you are driving. The app turns on automatically when it detects that the user is moving faster than 15 MPH and turns off shortly after it detects that the user has stopped.\"  The creativity of generation Z is outstanding and unique to modern day society. The opportunity for students to create the projects would be extraordinary and expressive of our generation. The use of creativity is very limited in school. You are to be complacent with the standards of your school through the strict rules and regulations they place. Many of the rules you are given are not only rigid but not needed. Teachers set boundaries on students and rarely let them experience\u00a0and express their own style and flair. When students are allowed to indulge in their personal ambiance their limits are endless. This is embodied through art and the publishing of students in modern day. More books written by teenagers are selling on the shelves today, than ever before.  Things like the picture of the Loch Ness Moster, the famous photo that was confirmed to be faked. Another good example is the \"Bigfoot\" craze. Both cases are similar to this one because all are just photos that are hard to be certain about, that sparked international interest. Not only are they similar that way, but each one has been debunked with solid evidence.  These electors cast their vote depending on the votes that we (you and I), cast. These electors that we choose are generally very trustworthy and reliable, being the reasons we choose these government officials to elect our government leaders. Sadly, however, not everybody is who they say they are, as we all have flaws and sins; occasionally one of these electors will be unfaithful and vote for the canidate they deem fit, instead of who we have chosen ourselves. Although this is rare, the possibilities would be negated completely if we simply had direct, individual voting. ",

                "content": "like its says in paragraph 6 \"Imagine a computer that knows when you're happy or sad\". For example if you smile when a web ad appears on your screen a similar ad might follow. But if you frown the next ad will be different \"A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored \"Most human communication is nonverbal including emotional communication\" noted Dr. Huang \"So computers need to understand that too  Nick D' Alto says \"Imagine a computer that knows when you're happy or sad.\" The author of this article talks of how it will improve ad placements by whether you smile or frown, however I know for a fact social medias, especially Facebook, are already basing information on preferable ads by just what material you look at. Why is it necessary for a program to constantly scan our face just to see if we like something or not? This gives the computer so much power of constantly knowing what your exact emotions are on everything. It is just so unnecessary that it causes one to question why in the world would we risk giving computers that kind of power. Also, is it appropiate to constantly scan childrens' faces as they are trying to learn? Would there be a security system in place or parental agreement necessary that would allow the permission of constant invasion of privacy in the name of education? There are many ethical questions and unknown future outlooks that one would not want to subject children to that sort of test of safety and security.  I beieve that it is the right thing to do, and that all will benefit from the experience. At some point, many will realize that computers are smarter than humans in many ways. Even though many think that the computers will have internal failure and create issues, I do not think that is the case. Companies involved in this new technology will test the product far before the release of any of their final product. The last thing they want is to have a disaster of driverless car failure. The fact that people support these ideas rather than oppose them shows that the majority of the population will want these vehicles on the street. The advancements that are currently being made and the support of the public make a point. Completely driverless cars will be here soon, and it is only a matter of time before everyone is introduced.  This can be seen in the text when it says, \" A classroom computer could recognize when a stuent is becoming confused or bored,\" Dr Huang predicts. \"Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor,\"\" (D'Alto 6). This exemplifies that the schools want to use this technology to help students learn more effectively by using technology thats like a teacher. For some students this may cause trouble if they make facial expressions, but it's not about the lesson. Such as if a student is told something by another student and the student looks confused, the computer might see that and think they dont understand the lesson. Then it would modify the lesson for the student even if the student understood it just fine. A teacher would be much better at understanding the students emotions in a certain situation than technology.  There is a saying that goes as this; \"You can't make everyone happy.\" One would typically use this saying if an action they make improves the situation for one person, but creates a worse situation for another. However, if Professor Thomas Huang's new 'Facial Action Coding System' proves to be what he says it can be, then Huang believes that there actually is a way to make everyone happy, even in the school setting.  Dr. Huang states Your home Pc cant handle the complex algorithms used to decode smiles\" This saying from Dr. Huang proves that a PC for home use is not strong enough for this program so what makes you average home pc different from a school one other than filters put on the pc which reduces preformance but the worse thing that could happen is what if the power happens to shut down or go out do to a surge that program requires power to run so that is also a big problem.  As far as what is explained in this article the only benefit to this technology is that computers will know what you are feeling, and the question that needs to be asked is; do we really want them to?  A project called mechanical computers was first evisioned in the 1800s. The author further supports how its worthy by stating, \"...these devices make calculations by using gears and levers and do not require electronics at all\" (Paragraph 7). He describes it as safer, since gear usually ensures that someone will not be exposed to a certain conditon in a inhabitable environment for humans. He further argues that modern computers are more fragile in extreme conditions, and are not as strong as mechanical computers. He strongly supports it by comparing it to other popular technologies, \"...imagine exposing a cell phone or tablet to acid or heat capable of melting tin\" (Paragraph 7). He explains in comparison, that systems using mechanical parts are far more resistant to pressure, heat, and other forces, unlike modern technology. He uses well thought out support and evidence, to argue that Venus is actually a worthy pursuit even with the dangers it gives. He believe that studing Venus will lead to challenges that will further evolve humanity and help it prosper.   Dr. Huang is talking about how it can change the ads you see and veiw if you dont look happy when you look at them. Dr. Huang states \"For example when a web ad appears on your screen and you smile a similar ad may follow, But if you frown the next ad will be different. A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,\" Dr. Huang predicts. This Quote and prediction of Dr. Huang states that is has potential to keep students intrestred into work  In the excerpt, \"The software is the latest innovation from Prof. Thomas Huang, of the Beckham Institute for Advanvced Science at the University of Illinois, working in collaboration with Prof. Nicu Sebe of the University of Amsterdam,\" shows just how recent this technology is. (D'Alto 1). With this in mind, if students were able to be introduced and subject to this technology, there could be future scientist that want to further improve this technology and, until then, would be more involved in it's place at school. (D'Alto 1). Also, due to the fact that this technology is not only limited to the classroom, it is then evident that other jobs could be produced out of this technology being in the classroom, sparking interest in young and vulnerable students. As the author includes, \"The same technology can make computer-animated faces more expressive--for video games or video surgery,\" it is showsn just exactly how various the fields are that this technology could be used in. (D'Alto 6). Whether a kid is devoted to learning about medicne or engrossed in playing games, it has been shown that this technology in the classrooms would expose these kids to it's capabilities and potentially create a passion. (D'Alto 6). Therefore, by including this technolgy in the classroom with it's own purpose, the students would be subject to technolgy that is blooming in several fields and could easily inspire a child to become something that utilizes this technology in their future.

                "content": "The first step to make a good decision is to think about your conquences. Some people make a decision and regret it because they did not think about their conquences. For example, when people go to jail, they regret their descision they made because it changed their life in a horrible way. Other peoples opinions can lead you into a bad direction, if you dont think about the possible outcomes. There can be some bad outcomes when you listen to peoples opinions, but if you chose carefully and follow the correct steps it will not be so bad. If someone is per-persuring you, that is never the right way to listen someones advice because they are forcing you. Always listen to yourself when someone is forcing you and not always be a follower, but also listen to other opinons when they are not forcing you.  if the President thinks that this is the best time for their country to go to war, but they don't know if any of the people they rule over, or even the rest of the government, thinks the same way, it would almost certainly make the president feel less confident in their decision than if they knew what people thought about their decision, and they might not do as good a job running the country because they might stress about it. But if they consulted many advisers before making that vital decision, the advisers might agree with the president, resulting in the president feeling more confident with their decision and ultimately leading the country better than if they just went with what one person said and didn't ask multiple people for advice first.  For example, there might be\u00a0some ignorant people who know next to nothing about the other side's situation. When people dont know much about another side's struggles or even their side of the story, they may place too much of their biases onto you or your situation. Another thing, some people have more experience with giving advice. Some people are just more fit to give you advice. For example, who would you be more comfortable taking an opinion from, a friend or a therapist? You may know where to look, but its probably safer to simply get more people's opinions. Even so, sometimes people who aren't in those particular fields tend to think more simply, which might be what you need along with that professional opinion to form a bigger, clearer\u00a0picture. If you're having trouble picturing what I mean, think of it like a doctor. If you get back your diagnosis and it seems wrong or misinformed, you'll probably end up asking for a second opinion. That way you get a more clear and sensible diagnosis that goes with your symptoms. Furthermore, asking different people for their opinions may just bring in some more qualified ideas into your argument.   Some people view it was selfish that one person would risk sending a text knowing that it has the potential to kill an innocent person or peoples . A text can always wait when others' lives are on the line . Its an over-estimation of one's personal confidence when driving . Noone that texts and drives really thinks and analyzes the hard that they are doing or can do to all the people in the cars around them . In the cars are innocent mothers , fathers, children , veterans , teachers ect . It goes without saying that they don't deserve to die due to someone thinking that because they've texted and driven before , noone will die .  The feeling of indecisiveness where your brain is waging war on itself, Google is giving out useless information, time is ticking, and you just wish someone was there to tell you what they think  If its about what you want to wear today and you ask someone they have given you their viewpoint and their constructive critisim about it. If you are asking people to give you advice about what type of people you should be around with then your getting more viewpoints on the matter. It could even be a viewpoint that saves you from a deathly mistake like if you were thinking about joining the army and you friend says, \"I dont think your ready for the army maybe somethig that could help but less physical like the airforce\". Then you sign up for the air force and in two weeks you hear on a sad gloomy day that the whole troop you were about to join was sent to the dark jungles of vietnam and now was all killed in action. That tiny viewpoint and good advice just saved your life.  What if you ask one friend for advice and their mad at the moment and they probably dont have your best interest in mind and you should get another opinion. I try not to ask mad friends for advise when possible.  You should ask multiple people because everyone dosent know whats best for you. My parents are the only people who know whats best for me.  Also your friends and peers dont always have your best interest in mind, sometimes they could give you bad advice to be funny. This happens to me all the time. This is my third reason why seeking more than one opinion can help you make a better choice.  The impact of asking people to help\u00a0you make a decision can be big, like a country deciding to go to war, or small, like a third grader choosing if they want to go into the advanced program in school, but nonetheless, asking for other people's opinions instead of just one person's opinion can make a difference in someone's life, whether big or small.  In reality, this technology continues to prove its many values, and it's evergrowing amount of benifits that completly overpower all the ideas that some may think its unnimportant.  We all know where there are friends, there are foes. When you group a bunch of developing teenagers going through puberty, where emotions and hormones are swarming around, you get a sort of cesspool of emotion. Yes, at times there will be drama, fights, gossip, harassment, and many other things normal to the life of every day teens. Some may say this is a lie, but it is very well the cold hard truth. People won't always get along it's apart of the human nature, and as you're growing up you are still trying to figure out what you do or don't get along with. ",

I do not agree with the electoral college because agree with our fore father Abraham Lincoln. He said this was supposed to be a country of the people, by the people, and for the people.   However, I believe that the popular vote is more fair because it expresses the opinion of the majority.  Most people think that the electoral college is not reasonable.

The proof is in the article when you see the 3 picutes that were taken to prove it wasn't a alien made artifact. No matter how cool it would be if it was not to mention that it could make NASA famous or rich it just doesn't have the proof you need to be a alien artifact. If you look more into the passage it even says it was not a alien made artiffact. Yes this face was very famous it even says \"The \"Face\" on Mars has since been a pop icon. It has starred in a Hollywood film, apperered in books, magazines, and even radio shows.\" (5). See how famous that face was 25 years ago is amazing but it still doesn't mean it was a alien made artiffact. So in final say it is not a alien made face and nor will there be enough proof its just a landmark on Mars that was very popular to people everywhere!            Just to show you what I mean, I'm going to get into more detail. Not to long ago my family, best friend, and I went out to go eat at Subway and when we got back into the car there was a man behind with all gold teeth, as soon as I saw him I didn't trust him because of his teeth and I started making a fist. Reasons like this is why I'm always trying to get advice from different people, I've seen how screwed up our world is right know and I've had trouble trusting people in public, what my parents always tell me is to welcome everyone. I know I should be following what they have told because I've done that my whole life, that's the reason I try my best not to cuss, I will sometimes say words like that, but I still try my best not to   It's becoming too much to bare. Despite the happiness and comfort they gave you all those years ago, they've changed. They're being more critical of you and your other friends, they have been asking you for money frequently without paying back their debt, and are being rude about you not spending time with them, despite them barely spending time with you. Despite you telling them about your concerns, they haven't stopped. You think it's about time you cut ties with your closest friend that you have known since your elementary school days. You ask your mother about what you should do, and she gives you her opinion from the outside looking in. You understand her thinking, but you're not quite satisfied with her answer. You feel as if you should ask someone else, but its not because you dont respect your mom's opinion, you just want another bit of advice. Why is that? Why do we feel the need to get more than one piece of advice after already receiving what we see as a satisfactory answer?  Leonardo Da Vinci was one of the greatest reniassance painters of the time. His study of the human anatomy allowed him to create pictures that captured the humna state. On of his most well known paintings is the \"Mona Lisa\". The Mona Lisa is a women that has sort of complacent facial features. She doesn't really look happy or sad. This was the popular thought up until a new technology was created. This technology is called the Facial Action Coding System. This technology is able to deduce what emotion a person is feeling. It is able to do this whothout the person even showing an obvious emotion. This technology can also be implenmented in many spheres of life, including in the classroom.  Truthfully it is just another way to tell someone no to doing this or that or it is a continuation of limiting people on their creativity. Back in 6th grade most people had a problem with the art tecaher because she had such strict rules in a way it was either her way or the highway. No one could really understand why she had us doing things this way or that way. With that being said everyone was hoping that one day she would actually miss a day and one day she called out but then I looked around me everyone was having a fun time because they could express themselves through their art. All students need to be able to express themselves without having someone telling them that they are doing things wrong.  There you have it. The Face sadly wasn't built by aliens, it was just a natural landform that happened to have some pretty neat features to it due to shadows. There is no way around it, because the pictures don't lie. It is even more obvious that it is a landform because ones just like it exist on Earth! Even though it would've been very interesting for it to have been actually created by aliens, it was just a natural landform in the end.  In 1976 the face looked like a face. In 1998 it started to not look like a face at all. In 2001 it just looked like a rock. So i believe that it was not created by aliens but that it was just something the olanet had made itself. This has certainly got the attention of the people.  The \"Face on Mars\" is not a face. If you look at the pictures from 1976, and 1998, and 2001 and in the text it says that the photo from 2001 is the most recent photo that NASA has. It still looks nothing like a face so since the 2001 picture is the most recent it shows that it is just a natural landform. It is just a natural landform. On Mars there are natural landforms everywhere and the fade away. Here on earth natural landforms are created everyday.  At one point in life everyone has gone through or knows someone who has been through a tough decision. A couple years ago I had a friend who always gave advice to everyone's\u00a0problems. She was beautiful, intelligent and fun to be around. However, she did not feel this way about herself. As time went on some situations became too heavy to handle, the stress grew on top of her. At school she only showed perkiness, meanwhile, she was in a darker place. No one was aware of this until a few weeks later when she spoke to her friends, then counselors, next teachers and eventually her parents to get the help she wanted. She was afraid of what the world would think of her if she wasn't perfect. These people all helped her find ways for comfort and how to get the treatment needed without doing something harmful to herself or others. She was steered back into a safe and happy pathway thanks to the help of those around her.  Three years later we recieved the best results possible. the photo not only showed no carvings but it also showed that there was no face at all!  People feel differently about lots of different things, whether they are small issues like shoes being ugly, or big issues like political opinions and whether schools should have dress code. What if someone wants to buy a Cadillac. Obviously, Cadillacs\u00a0are expensive and the person would ask somebody before spending their hard earned money on a Cadillac. If the person asks their best friend who thinks they are ugly if they should get a Cadillac, they would obviously say no. The best friend has an opinion on Cadillacs. If the person had asked somebody who thinks Cadillacs are amazing, they would say to buy it. This is an example of why asking multiple people before making a choice is good because they might have different opinions. If someone wants to open a donut\u00a0shop, but their uncle hates donuts. When they ask their uncle if they should open a donut shop, he will say no. He has an opinion of thinking donuts taste gross. But when they ask their sister who loves all desserts and will always support her sibling. She will say yes because she has an opinion of loving sweet foods and her siblings. This is an example of why people should ask more than one person before they do something. The student president might want to start a book club. A lot of students a do not like books because their teacher made them read a boring book three years ago and they have not liked books since then, they have an opinion on books from a long time ago. The teachers, on the other hand, love this idea because they think that students these days do not get enough reading time in and a book club would be a good idea. If the student president would not have asked the teachers if they liked the idea there would be no book club ",

Jim Garvin, chief scientist for NASA's Mars Exploration Program explained, \"As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size...So, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!\" By stating this, Garvin is saying that if there was any evidence of aliens builing this face on Mars, it would have been found.  The usage of vehicles are a double-edged sword. They may get us to where we need to go with plenty of time to spare, but what are we really loosing because of it? What we are loosing is the environment and also our health. In Paris, the pollution rate almost reached a new record high, thus forcing the partial driving pan to clear the air of the global city. In the article, \"Paris bans driving due to smog\", its evident that cars hurt us in more ways then we realize. Buisnesses are suffering due to the lack of transportaion avaliable to delivery their services as seen in source number two, \"Delivery companies complained of lost revenue\". \"Congestion was down 60% in the capital of france after five-days of intesifying smog...\" The smog was so dense that Paris officials created a law making even-numbered license plates to leave there cars at home to reduce pollution.  Driverless cars are coming, and they are going to be dangerous. Driverless cars are coming and they stilll have a lot of issues to work through that could be dangerous. Driverless cars are going to reward the lazy for being lazy, and make them have to do even less work. Taking away the need for human drivers in vehicles will take away great memories, fun adventures, and many valuable skills that peple can gain while driving a car. These cars also can cause many safety issues including accidents from the lack od the cars ability to handle certain situations and could also cause issues if the drivers of these cars fall alseep when there is a sitiuation where there is a need for a human driver. RIght now these cars do not have enough safety features and they do not have enough driving capability to be safe for public use. If the manufactoring companies continue to work on these cars and make improvements, then these cars might not be completely bad, but as of right now they are not safe enough or skillled enought to be sent out to the pubic.  Well, that point can actually be rebuted as well, because of what Jim Garvin, the chief scientist for NASA's Mars Exploration Program, said, \"As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixer size,\" he added. \"So, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!\". Factually that should be the end of it, it was a clear picture, that was enhanced for farther detail, on a clear day, with a high resolution camera.  To justify my argument that everyone should be against the development of these driverless cars, just think about if it was you. These cars can not be pradictable and no one can be postive what will really happen. But what if it was you who got hurt or maybe a family memeber, because they let these unsafe and unperdicable cars out onto the roads. You would have no one to blame because it was just a machine or just a accendent. They are never meant to hurt but everyone would rather be safe than sorry. Make the right choice and do whats right to keep people safe, not to make their lives easier.  A project called mechanical computers was first evisioned in the 1800s. The author further supports how its worthy by stating, \"...these devices make calculations by using gears and levers and do not require electronics at all\" (Paragraph 7). He describes it as safer, since gear usually ensures that someone will not be exposed to a certain conditon in a inhabitable environment for humans. He further argues that modern computers are more fragile in extreme conditions, and are not as strong as mechanical computers. He strongly supports it by comparing it to other popular technologies, \"...imagine exposing a cell phone or tablet to acid or heat capable of melting tin\" (Paragraph 7). He explains in comparison, that systems using mechanical parts are far more resistant to pressure, heat, and other forces, unlike modern technology. He uses well thought out support and evidence, to argue that Venus is actually a worthy pursuit even with the dangers it gives. He believe that studing Venus will lead to challenges that will further evolve humanity and help it prosper.   Clearly, the author has efficiently and convincingly supported the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. By describing all the information about the existence of other life forms and the similarities to Earth that we could potentially learn from the study, the author proves how worthy Venus is to be discovered. The author also rebuttals one of the main concerns for traveling to the planet by explaining how plans are being developed to make travel and living conditions surviveable, safe, and efficient for both humans and machines. In \"The Challenge of Exploring Venus,\" the author was able to convey and support the idea that Venus is worthy of exploration.  He does not support this idea throughly, giving limited information to convice the reader of his claim. He only says it can last in challenging conditions for a limired amount of time, but does not mention any support, leaving silicon carbide as his weakest support on how using that, can convice people that Venus is a worthy pursit depsite the dangers it possesses. He uses only one fact, but not not give enough anaylsis to make his argument strong or very clear.  While the internet can be used in very useful and academic ways, there are also a plethora of ways to get sidetracked. Things like social media platforms and Netflix will always be there taunting the student, requiring a substantial amount of willpower to not give into these deep dark holes of mindless entertainment. If it is already hard enough for students to focus in classrooms with a physical adult present giving instructions, just think how much harder it will be to focus without any of these accomodations (plus the addition of having the freedom to wear pajamas and move at their own pace). Not only will they have other platforms distracting them, but they will also have to make sure they are staying on track and not pushing things off to the last minute  The best way to understand how the world works is to ask questions. Without questions we would still be living in caves with no electricity and wearing no clothes. \"Two heads are always better than one\", said the great Albert Einstein. Asking multiple opinions will produce a better outcome than just using you're knowledge on the subject. There is only one way to put this, it is a complete mistake for someone to go into something blind, you need to know your surroundings, it just so happens that the only way to avoid going into something blind, is asking people their opinions.\u00a0   \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0   \u00a0 ",

Yes, as said before many people want to get rid of the Electoral College but it will stay with the United States and move forward with us people.  We should get rid of the electoral college all together. This system is not working for a lot of people and this is why many people dont care enough to vote anymore. There are people that vote for our state. Why should the people care? If we switched to popular vote, our country might participate in picking who the next president of the United States will be. When people have a voice, they will use it as much as they possibly can.       \u00a0       \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Electoral College is a process that help the United States over many many years. So my question now is, why are you trying to get rid of it? They made so it a vote from Congress would go towards the President and a popular vote from cictizens. Without the Electroal College barely anyone's vote would be heard and Congess would be making our choice for us  Electoral College should be abolished because the electors may help ruin the president election and large states are not vistied or spoken to from the president other than small states. Electoral college may seem an unfair disadvantage for most voters many of their campaign that they want to win can be rather at a disadvantage or advantage depending on their electors,\u00a0 many electors may betray their campaign because they're not pubilicly held in office. Lastly the disadvantage is that many voters want to see what and how they are going to change or improve their well being, but most electors and campaigns do not visit the states that want view and know the candidates better. The electoral College should be abolished for the matter of the voter and the United States of America. In my opinion we should be allowed to vote on our own, for example instead of voting for an elector we should just vote on the type of campagin whose better and meet our daily bases needs.   To sum it all up, the Electoral college is just an unnecassary back up plan when there is not one needed. It is unfair to the citizens and the candidate's electors are unreliable. If there was a way to keep the Electoral College, it would only be for ties. It wouldnt be needed if the vote was a clean win. When the President Election comes in the next 3 years, I hope that you consider my thoughts, because there are plenty people out there with the same perspective.     (In source 2) Even presidents want to get rid of the electoral college that is saying something. People would rather have a direct election then the kind we have now and I agree. See when the people are voting for electors they dont know what that elector is going to vote for they can only hope for what he is going to vote for. (source 2) Paragraph 13 \"At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters.  This might be the hundreth letter opened about this electoral college topic, but this is a very important subject that needs to be run by all of our citizens. Honestly the electoral college is very important because of the fact that after elections after everyone has voted they are the ones that are the electors for the President and the Vice President. Its not like it was made for no reason it was made to make the elections fair, it's not like it's the first time people have wanted to get abolish the Electoral College even many people have wanted to remove this like for example Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, and more but this dosnt mean that it is the right choice. Yes it is agreed that there are some downs to have the Electoral College, plus even the person that the Electoral College votes fo that might not be the person most of the nation choose. Like now in the 2012 elections Obama had more Electoral votes than Romney\"Because almost all states award the electorsl votes on a winner-takes all basis.\"  The Electoral College needs to be abolished, so that the peolpe of the U.S.A can vote on the president for real. People want a derect vote not just to sit and watched the peoson that they voted for not get elected becuase of a College that has all the \"power\"  \"At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters. because of the winner-takes-all system in each state canidates dont spend time in states they spend no time in stats the know thy wont win.\" Some states can get no canidates out and its because the electoral college is unfair. \"It`s official: The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. The best argumants in favor of it are mostly assertions without much basis in reality. And the arguments against direct election ar spurios at best. Its hard to say but Bob Dole was right: Abolish the electoral college!\" This Quote states that the electoral college is not fair and down right rediculus ",

This means if the voter is from the south, they have no reason to campaign heavily in those sates. Instead they can spend more time in states that need a little more convincing fot the candidate to gain their vote. It also restores some of the weight in the political balance that a large states loses by virtue of the mal-appotrionment of the Senate decreed in the constitution  under the electoral college system, voters vote not for president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president. a dispute over the outcome of an elecoral college vote is possible, it happend in 200 but, its less likely than a dispute over the popular vote. The reason is that the winning candidate's share of the electoral college invariably exceeds his share of the popular vote. The electoral college requires a presidential candidate to have transregional appeal.  it is considered a non-democratic method for selecting a president, and it is all up to the electors of a candidate. The Electoral College should also be changed to popular vote because it is not the people who are choosing the president, it is the three electors sent from each different state.  The popular voting method is directly controlled by the people and their vote is sent directly to their desired candidate. On the other side, by using the electoral college method voters vote for a select member of the state's electoral college votes and that member is\u00a0 elgible to vote for any presidential candidate of their choice. According to the article \"In Defense of the Electoral College: Five Reasons to keep our Despised Method of Choosing the President\" by Richard A. Posner, \" when you vote for a presidential candidate you are actually voting for a slate of electors.\" Further evidence from this article (quote on quote) claims there is a \" lack of democratic pedigree.\" Electoral voting also only benefits the larger states because of there is a\u00a0 larger amount of members of the electoral college for the\u00a0 larger states.  The Electoral College is a process where voters select electors who then vote for the President of the United State. But is it really that reliable? Is it better than an election decided by that of popular vote.   The Electoral College is widely regarded as an anachronism, a non-democratic method of selecting a president that needs to be overruled by declaring the canidate who receives the most popular votes the winner. I personally think that is the best way to decide who gets in.  Under the Electoral College, voters do not vote directly for who they want as president, but instead for a slate of electors, who in turn select the president. Although these electors may pledge themselves to a particular candidate, there is no way to determine whether or not they end up casting their vote according to the will of the people who put them in charge. Such an unpredictable turn of events could be avoided if only the outcomes of presidential elections were determined by popular vote, not through an Electoral College.  The Electoral College is a non-democratic method of voting because voters only get to vote for a slate of electors, not the president of their choice.  The Electoral College is as it says on the 3rd source \"widely regarded as an anchronism, a non-democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be [overruled] by declaring the candidates who receives the most popular votes the winner.\"  The President of the United States is currently determined by an electoral college. The electoral college process involves the public voting for their elector and not the main focus, the candidates. Through this, many of the states gain more power than they should, and the votes are set up as a \"Winner-takes-all\" system. ",

Since most of the time Congress has a party that makes up a majority of it, it would be very unfair to allow them to pick the president. It's also possible that even if a majority of the people vote for a president, the electoral votes elect the other candidate instead, like what happened to Al Gore in 2000. An election like this just has too many holes and pitfalls to be efficient. The holes need to be repaired before we can actually use this as our primary way to select a president, or else we're setting ourselves up to have problems in the future.  In doing this you are having a fair vote in the election with everyone who is eligable to vote, voting whomever they please. If you vote for your own president of your choice there will not be any elector deciding for you if they do not like what you have elected. We need to have a say in what we want. I mean if we want someone to be watching over us, and deciding what to do, we want someone who everyine agrees on. Just a few hundred poeoplpe choosing for you is nothing compared to approximatley more than a million people choosing for themselves. In  Source 2 \"The indefensible electorial college : why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong by Bradford Plumer\"  it says that the electors can always defy the will of the people. In my case I believe that no one would want that. I mean, would you want that?  Everyone would get to put in their opinion on who should be the president of the United States. I think that if everyone was to be able to individually vote for their president, there would be less chaos and arguements about the election and also the new president.\u00a0But,\u00a0it is possible that the winner of the electoral vote won't win the national popular vote. But, it is very rare. Some people don't bother voting because of the fact that their vote will have no effect. They have less incentive to pay attention to the campaign than they would have if the president were picked by popular vote.  The people make the decisions, the people vote for what they want and the people should be able to elect a president they believe will give them that! According to source 3 \"... it is the electors who elect the president, not the people.\" Why can't the people be the electors? If the people in the United States don't have the freedom to vote for a president of their choice, what say do they really have? Electing a president is like raising money for charity, the president does all the work but all they money that is raised goes to charity (the people). The people want someone who will help raise the money for them, not screw over their charity. Just like when signing up for a job the boss needs to see your resume, is like the people needing to see what the president can do to help their country. The citizens should be the ones making the decisions with help from the president that they believe could help with such decisions, not from electors who believe so.  It isn't right to select a few people from each state to decide who the President will be. That power lies with the people, and nobody should be able to take that away. The votes of millions and millions of people are out-weighed by the votes of a few hundred men and women. This is unjust and unfair in every way. If all the people in the United States wanted somebody as President, but the Electoral College disagreed, the Electoral College would win. Why should the Electoral College have more power than all of the people of the United States; they shouldn't. The power to decide who is President of the United States of America should always lie with the good citizens that live here.   All in all the Electoral College is just the better method of voting. The Electoral College will give what the people want. Also the electoral college\u00a0 represents the states votes. The reason is because electoral colleges are game changers and a trust worthy method. Certainly it wll be easier to choose a president and break ties.     They have much more power than the standard voter. The electors would completly oppose the most \"popular\" vote and put in their vote for whoever they feel deserves it. This is wrong and totally goes against the idea of giving the people power. This would qualify as just giving a few people power. There could also be room for a tie. This could result in the elcetion ending in the hands of the House of Representatives where the state delegates could chose the president. Not only is this destorying the power of the general public but this could also result in people not getting what they wanted. The delegates cuold go completly against what the people say because they technially have the right to since they have the power of the situation.  When people have to much freedom they don't know what to do and do wrong choices so i think choosing a elector is a good thing they have studied the president and have heard countless promises that he has done. I mean he or she most likley will vote for the candiate running for president you did because he or she is a elector he or she gets the people who also voted for the same person as he or she wants.  To start with, how can we live in a democracy were the people do not pick their own president but, some representatives we suposadly chose can. If we were alowed to choose our own president then we could at least feel right in what we chose and not what the representatives did.  I think it is more fair to have the people of the United States vote directly for their president instead of voting for a slate of electios that then choose the president. ",

                "content": "While there are many positives to this technology some might argue that computers cannot actually calculate human emotion. They argue that human emotion is not somehting that can or should be understood because it would ruin the entirety of feeling certain ways.  The technology is able to identfy a human's true emotions, but that will not alter the way that person feels.  Nowadays, technology and science became one of important parts in human life, it makes life runs easier. With human's intelligent, technology is improved day by day. Many things are dicovered, or invented that we don't even know about their appearances. One of them is the Facial Action Coding System also known as FACS, which technology could identify human emotions was created by Dr. Paul Eckman.  Computers don't have emotions, but you do! Imagine technology that seriously works for you, not only at home but also in the classroom! If technology could accurately read human facial expressions the learning possibilities could be endless. For example, think about that one story that you're forced to read that you just can't understand and brings out all your frustrations, with facial expression recognition you probably will never be so frustated again.  New technology is being introduced to mankind almost every second in this world, and now, the latest techonology is a computer program called the Facial Action Coding System which can identify a person's emotions. The question is whether this technology is actually valuable and for what it could be used for. Experts suggest this technology could be used in a classroom to identify the state of mind of a student to adjust the lesson they are trying to comprehend. But, even though this technology may be helpful to teachers trying to keep students active and engrossed in their lessons, the question arises of whether this techonlogy is actually worth the recources or whether what experts think is a great idea is actually an invasion of privacy.  The article states that the technology associates each emotion with \"characteristic movements of the facial muscles\" and then uses those movements to calculate the spectrum of emotions based on their facial display. But some people show emotions in various ways, and the technology most likely cannot accomodate for the many different ways people express the same emotion. For example, if a student has a resting face that seems generally happy, the system might confuse this dazed face as a satisfied face and think that the student is happy with their lessons when they are actually confused or not paying attention. In the same way, if a student has a resting face that looks naturally sad, the system may think they are unhappy with their lessons, even if the student feels they are learning a lot. A lot of students also try to hide their emotions, like frusteration or sadness, with a happier look on their face, and even though the article states that the system can detect a \"false smile\", it cannot always be accurate as a person may be good at hiding their emotions and displaying a genuine smile. Therefore, since technology is not always accurate and because human beings are so various in the way they behave, the technology would not be useful in a classroom where it may misread a student's state of mind and lead them in the wrong path of education.  According to the article \"Making Mona Lisa Smile,\" there is a new technology called the Facial Action Coding System (FACS) that enables computers to identify human emotions. This technology is relatively brand new. It creates a 3-D computer model of all fourty-four major muscles in the face that move like human muscles as well. Then, psychologists have classified six basic emotions that are associated with different movements in the facial mucles. This new technology could result in many benefits in our community as well as all around the world  There's a new kind of technology called Facial Action Coding System, or FACS, which enables computers to identify human emotions. The use of this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is very valuable  The implications of technology that can detect emotions simply by reading the muscles in the face sound truly remarkable. The thought that one can tell what another is thinking simply by plugging data or maybe even a picture into an algorithm sounds like fiction, but may soon be a reality. The article, \"Making Mona Lisa Smile\" by Nick D'Alto briefly discusses the possible use of such technology in a classroom. The system could examine student's faces, and if they read to be unengaged or uninterested, could adjust the lesson to make learning more interesting to that group of students. That type of technology could revolutionize learning, and customly tailor lesson plans to the feelings of students on any given day.  The Facial Action Coding System enables computers to identify human emotions. This new software has a promising applications for a variety of industries. \"Can we actually calculate emotions, like math homework?\" \"How can a computer recognize the subtle facial movements we humans use to express how we feel?\" ",

                "content": "The FACS will pick up emotions that a student is feeling and teachers, parents, and or consoulers will be able to get the help that that particular student aqquires. \"To an expert, faces don't lie; these muscle clues are sometimes used to spot when a \"smiling\" politicain or celebrity isn't being truthful.\" This same concept can work with students too. If a student is giving off a false emotion than that student really feels; the FACS can determine the actual emotion the student is feeling. If teachers and parents realize the actual feelings and emotions someone feels, he or she will be able to provide more comfort in the act of helping towards that individual.  They may lie about not doing their homework or be untruthful about whether they were involved in a fight. The FACS machine could solve that issue as it is able to determine whether someone is lying or not based on their expression which is stated in the quote,\" To an expert, faces don't lie; these muscle clues are sometimes used to spot when a \"smiling\" politician or celebrity isn't being truthful.\" This machine is able to examine the details of one's face to find out if they are lying or not. It examines the key traits of each specific emotion and if they are not meant, that is how it knows whther the truth has been told or not. Students will no longer bee able to weasel their way out of punishment due to their superior lying skills as the FACS machine is able to see through the lies. This is not the only thing this machine can do though for schools.  Many students would say that they would never do such a thing, that they must honor their integrity, but they're lying. Teenagers are impulsive, and if there is an easy road out, we are going to take it, simple as that. For example, if a teacher gives an assignment and they say the answer key is on schoology to check our work, we're going to maybe attempt it. When we don't succeed, guess where we're going: Schoology. I'm saying that I don't trust teenagers to be able to honestly do every single assignment on their own especially if there are no eyes watching. Another example of this would be in a scenario of this said online school. Imagine that there's a big test due on the 18th in math that you haven't studied for. Today is the 17th. Everyone else has done the test and taken pictures of it in case their computers shut down, while others had malicious intent. You haven't studied at all. Your failure is imminent as you already have a C in the class and you need a C to graduate. Your heart is thumping, you don't want to seem a failure to your parents. So what do you do? Ask the teacher for an extension? No, he's too strict and he's going to say no. So you think your only option is to cheat. So you text a student who took picures for the wrong reason. You get the answers you so desperately wanted. But at what cost? You take the test and get a 70. You nearly failed, but you didn't. You find out a few days later that several students have asked for an extension and received one. That is the mindset a lot of students go through when they cheat on a test or assignment.  It is no secret that many students dread coming to school, whether it be from stress, bullying, or simply not understanding the subjects. This system can pick up on a fake emotion, the author explains how it can read a \"fake smile\" and that to them \"faces don't lie\" (para. 8). If this system is able to sense when a student is unhappy or angry, this could be used as an advantage in helping the student. Not only this, but the author explains that \"moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions, but may even help produce them\" (para. 9). Taking both of these statements into account, and allowing them to be incorporated into the classroom, students may enjoy attending school and learning new things.  If a student is feeling sad or feeling stressed about home problems which they are trying to conceal, then the technology detects this and displays it for the teacher and the electronic lesson to see. This is an invasion of privacy, as the teacher does not need to know about a student's homelife or about their feelings outside the classroom. A teachers job should be to monitor how their students are feeling about their lessons, not about how their students are feeling about their life outside of school, and since this technology could pick up on digressing feelings, it should not be used in a classroom where a student's internal feelings are revealed to a teacher. Therefore, using Facial Action Coding could end up being an invasion of privacy that should not be introduced to the classroom.  As stated in by Nick D'Alto, most human communication is not verbal. Meaning that people express their emotions by their looks or their actions, but they chose when to do this. The Facial Action Coding System takes away this freedom from students, they do not have the choice when to express what they are feeling if anyone can just use a face scanning system on them. \" Imagine being able to detect exaclty how other people are feeling, even when they are trying to hide their emotions (D'Alto 1),\" this first sentence perfectly shows how it takes away peoples freedom of when they want to express certian emotions tocertian people.  Many people have been asked for their opinion, yet, they may not tell the truth. People have trouble telling the truth to people at times, simply because they worry that they may hurt that person's feelings. A lot of times, the thought process of the people that are lying is more along the lines of trying to be kind and respectful, rather than giving a fully honest opinion. Although some people might not tell the truth, others most likely will, if asked. Since honesty is a key component of trust, honesty is valued far more in rough situations, than just being nice.  If a student shows confusion or discontent, it may be able to pick that up and show the teacher specific students that need help. The teacher could take the student aside and ask if they need help, and then adjust their learning accordingly. Another way this technology could help struggling students is to set them up with tutors that are doing well in the class. If a student is excited to learn consistantly during that class period, they could be sat next to a struggling student in order for the one not doing as well to recieve help from a peer. The ability to read emotions in the classroom would help students who are struggling tremendously.  This technology could be very benificial for students across the globe. The ability for a piece of technology to understand your emotions could come in handy. There are many outgoing students, but there are also many introverted students. Some students may not feel confident enough to ask for something to be repeated, so they may simply sit at their desks puzzeled for the rest of the class, while a simple question could've avoided this. If this technology is instituted, it will automatically know when a student isn't confident on the information and alert the teacher. By doing this, the introverted student won't be confused for very long and the topic could be revisited without the student to have to personally ask. It not only will help introverted students, but students across the board. Every student will benifit form this technology and will display in their grades. With this technology, the students acedemic achievements will expand exponentially.  Everyone deals with things that others probably don't know about. With FACS a student could come into class like Charlie and no one knows about his frustrations so they try to do their normal jokes and games with him. If a student ever comes into class not feeling the best or not wanting to be bothered, FACS could sense that and instead of people messing with that kid or having that kid be bothered, that child could have the option of being away from everyone while the child cools down. That could stop the child from being involved in a physical altercation or any altercations at that. ",

The best arguments in favor of it are mostly aserations without much basis in reality\", according to Source 2.  I would like you to consider all the problems our nation is facing due to the Electoral College. I have stated two contentions of why you should abolish the Electoral College; First,the method of how its done is very bias and unfair and secondly, because the Electoral College is a \"Disaster Factor\" or  causes many disruptions in our country.  \"It's offcial: The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational\" (Plumer, Source 2). Many do not like the electoral college for these reasons and many others such as it can be a distaster or because it is just plain dumb. Also there are a few reasons why the electoral college should be kept such as avoiding run-off elections or big states, but those not in favor of it out weigh those in favor of it.  To conclude, the Electoral College has caused many disastorous factors in our presidential campaigns. It has caused the wrong president to be elected, and it doesn't give our citizens much of a voice in the election. However, changing the system to popular vote for the president will give people a louder voice in this nation and it will show them that the government cares about their opinion. As the article, \"The Indefesible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid out defenses are wrong\" written by Bradford Plumer states, \"It's officual: The Electoral College is unfaor, outdated, and irrational. The best arguments in favor of it are mostly assertions without much basis in reality. And the arguents against direct elections are spurious at best.  Another reason, why the Electoral college is a disaster factor is becuase most of the United States citizens prefer a direct election to the kind we have now, Electoral College. More presiciely 60 percent of voters to dont want the electoral college, that's majority of our population! If majority of our nation is against the electoral college why haven't we abolished it?  In conclusion, we have established our opinion on why the vote should be changed into a popular vote instead of the Electoral College due to a myriad of concepts, such as the disaster factor in 2000, why swing-states are unfair, the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote, just to reveal the tip of the iceberg in our arguments of understanding why the Electoral College is biased, irrational, and unfair. We have also covered the counterclaims and reasoned them with logic, reality, and true rationality of why the Electoral College shoud be abolished in the vote of the President of the United States of America. So, ask yourself as a state senator, who is truly in the hands of the final say for the President?  Electoral College should be abolished because the electors may help ruin the president election and large states are not vistied or spoken to from the president other than small states. Electoral college may seem an unfair disadvantage for most voters many of their campaign that they want to win can be rather at a disadvantage or advantage depending on their electors,\u00a0 many electors may betray their campaign because they're not pubilicly held in office. Lastly the disadvantage is that many voters want to see what and how they are going to change or improve their well being, but most electors and campaigns do not visit the states that want view and know the candidates better. The electoral College should be abolished for the matter of the voter and the United States of America. In my opinion we should be allowed to vote on our own, for example instead of voting for an elector we should just vote on the type of campagin whose better and meet our daily bases needs.   The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. The system has been around for milleniums from our founding fathers and the Constitution in the 1700s to present day America, it is critical that we update our system to a more realistic process where the citizens have more say in the leader we choose to lead us.  \"At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters. because of the winner-takes-all system in each state canidates dont spend time in states they spend no time in stats the know thy wont win.\" Some states can get no canidates out and its because the electoral college is unfair. \"It`s official: The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. The best argumants in favor of it are mostly assertions without much basis in reality. And the arguments against direct election ar spurios at best. Its hard to say but Bob Dole was right: Abolish the electoral college!\" This Quote states that the electoral college is not fair and down right rediculus  In conclusion, the electoral college is ineffective and outdated. we should no longer use this as a system of defining our president. Even though a winner is often more clear, there is still a possibility of a tie between candidates. People who support the Electoral College also argue that its a good thing due to swing states having more attention payed to them and therefore being more careful in their decision. However, this reasoning is flawed in that it assumes that citizens of a state are more likely to inform theirselves thouroughly simply because their vote holds more value, in a sense. Also, candidates would no longer pay special attention to swing states if the electoral college weren't in place so the votes of these citizens wouldn't be held above the rest. Increased value of votes is not a good thing, which this argument also assume. It is the best decision to abolish the Electoral College.    The electoral college is not only obsolete, unnesessary and parasitic, but also unfair to many voters. The main ways this unfairness can be identified are extreme, and each really deserve a paragraph of their own. Let us imagine a scenario: a democrat lives in a mostly republican state ",

Even if the cameras used to take these pictures weren't of the highest quality, said cameras would have been able to at least catch some photos of further signs of life. Things such as houses or buildings, for example. Now, if some one would like to argue that the aliens lived in caves or other natural formations of the sort, how would those people like to argue the fact that there are no visible creatures in any photos? Do they expect people to believe that every living thing on Mars decided to hide from a satelite they would not even be able to see from the surface?  First and foremost, if these photos of the alleged face were the work of possible Martians, NASA would have found further evidence by now.  On the contrary, some people believe that the face is \"\"Bona fide\" evidence of life on Mars--evidence that NASA would rather hide, say conspiracy theorists\" (p. 5).  Conspiracy theorist were fast to make speculations that this was ancient alien architecture or something of the sort. But NASA said that the face was just a geograghical coincidence, and there is no alien stucture on Mars.  I find it highly unrealistic that NASA would even have been able to determine what the Face was forty years ago, much less hiding a discovery of extra-terrestrial life that could make a huge profit for the space program. And, had NASA really claimed that the Face was an object built by otherworldly life, surely someone would let the cat out of the bag. Not to mention that, if the vast majority of NASA believed it was an alien monument, do you really think that they would wait eighteen years to investigate the subject again? On top of all of this, it's simply illogical that aliens would create such a thing. As far as we all know, the supposed \"aliens\" on Mars have never come in contact with a human, much less seen one. That only leaves possible explanation; aliens created a monument that of which coincedentally resembles a human head. An absolute coincedence.  On April 5, 1998 Michael Malin and his \"Mars Orbiter Camera\" took a picture of the face. The picture was ten times sharper than the original and it proved that it was just a natural landform.  The article mentions, \"Meanwhile, defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an acient civilization on Mars.\" This statement proves that NASA has no reason to hide information.  About twenty-five years ago, something happened around Mars. NASA, snapped photos of the object. On Mars, there is a face printed on the plant. People think it was created by aliens. NASA said it was created on it's own. Scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa. Those are common around Cydonia. A couple of days later NASA saw a nose, eyes, and a mouth.  In conclusion, some people may think there is alien life on Mars because of past picture or conspiracy theories. No one can denty however, that NASA has proven the Face to be nothing but a natural landform on the Red Planet Mars. NASA has proven this by recent pictures, scientific evidence, and real-life examples and measurements. Over the years, NASA has worked hard to figure out the mystery of the face, and just recently they have discovered, with pictyures, evidence, and measruements, that the Face is just a natural landform with unusual shadowing formed on the Red Planet Mars.

A majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the president.\" The popular vote can get tied up pretty easily, but it is a lot harder for the electoral votes to get tied up because only 270 votes are needed to elect the president.  Each state gets one vote and then the electors can choose who they want for president. In source two it states that the electoral college consists of 538 electors and the most amont of elecrtoral votes is 270, in order to pick an president. Also in source two it states that the number of electors we have equals to the amount of members of congress we have. I propose a new system by only letting the American people select our president by votes counted all up by each state, for example if we didn't have have electoral college,\u00a0 then it would be a fair vote because people votes would count the number that adds up with all votes for one candidates that will oppose another candidates and there would be technically no tie it would either ,more or less, but if we still had the electoral college then the vote would not be equally fair becuse if the majority of a state for examlpe\u00a0 chose republican candidate, then that would be vague becuse some people choose democratic and there vote did not really count. but without the electoral collge, than everyones vote counts and each candidates gets vote from every one, not only electoral.  So that was and is my reasoning of why I think that the Electoral College should be removed from our political system. Between the being unfair to voters through voting for electors not even the president, reps not even being scaled right also the winner take all system making the system unbalanced, and the presidential candidates not even needing to appeal to most states just the swing states. I hope this passage convinces you that the Electoral College should be removed in place of a better system that is not out dated.       \u00a0       \u00a0     When the Constitution of the United States was written our founding fathers decided on an Electoral College as the way to ellect the president instead of a direct vote. The Electoral College is a process that makes a compromise between the popular vote of the citizens and the Congressional vote. When citizens vote for president they are actually voting for a member of the Electoral College that is going to select their president, rather than the citizens voting for the president themselves. The Electoral College is made of 538 electors, the number of electors from each state varies depending on the states Congressional delegation. Washington D.C. is counted as a state for this process and alloted only three electors.  It seems unfair that the president of the United States, the most important man in the country, is not truely picked by the voters, but by the Elctoral College. The Office of the Federal Register says that the electors that are selected are chosen by the candidates political party but that stae laws differ on how they are specifically selected. This way does not seem like the best way of performing the task and I can see how it results in issues. Trusting the weight of the United Stated on the the backs iof only 538 electors is not the most stable way to perform an election. Why trust a select group with this descion if the whole United States can contribute to it  As said in the article, \"What Is The Electoral College?\", \"The Electoral College process consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for President and Vice President, and the counting of the electoral votes by Congress.\" That is a huge amount of work but that is what keeps the elections well organized. Each candidate running for President in a state has their own group of electors. After each election, the governor of your state prepares a certificate presenting all of the candidates that ran for your state. As stated in the article by the Office of the Federal Register, \"The Certificate of Ascertainment also declares the winning presidential candidate in your state and shows which electors will represent your state at the meeting of the electors in December of the election year.\" The Electoral College is what mantains everything professional.  The Electoral College was originally founded to be exactly what it is today; a vote that is held in Congress that is made by popular vote by citizens. But it has changed more than you think.\u00a0 In article one in the 6th paragraph, it tells exactly how the Electoral College is run. \"The presidential election is held every four years on the Tuesday after the first Monday in Novemeber. You help choose your state's electors when you vote for President because when you vote for your candidate you are actually voting for your candidate's electors.\" This paragraph is saying that the person you vote for is basically supposed to be voted for by his electors. In the second\u00a0 article, what the author is saying is that even though this certain person will get popular vote, they won't agree with it and they'll go against the votors decisions. This isn't the right thing, obviously. I'm sure that no one knows for a fact that's true though. Even though, this is still a messed up way to vote.  Also, acorrding to the Office of the Federal Register a total of 270 or more electoral votes are needed to elect a president. The total amount of votes consists of 538 electors, meaning there could be a tie in elections. This implys that the system is not fool proof and can have errors. However, if the popular votes were counted more than the electoral votes there would not be any chance of a tie and a president will always be elected.  The Electoral College has served us for more than a century in determining our nation's new president. \"The Electoral College process consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for President and Vice President, and the counting of the electoral votes by Congress,\" states the article \"What Is the Electoral College?\" written by the Office of the Federal Register. This means that we do not vote directly vote for our new president, but instead vote for electors that vote for a candidate running for office. Though many individuals are in favor of keeping the Electoral College, if kept, it will continue to cause problems in our nation.  \"Under the electorial college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president.\" (Paragraph 10). In actuality, voters don't directly vote for the president when it comes to the electoral college. Although the Electoral College \"restores some of the weight in the polititcal balance that large states lose by virtue of mal-apportionment\", (paragraph 21) voters don't have the right to control whom their electors are said author Bradford Plumer. Voting for a group of electors doesn't always mean that they'll vote for the candidate in which you favor. This can have a huge affect on the reputation of the Electoral College itsself. ",

                "content": "With this in mind, there should be no Electoral College because the author suggests in Source 3: paragraph 19 that \"The Electoral College requires a presidential canidate to have trans-regional appeal.  Each state gets one vote and then the electors can choose who they want for president. In source two it states that the electoral college consists of 538 electors and the most amont of elecrtoral votes is 270, in order to pick an president. Also in source two it states that the number of electors we have equals to the amount of members of congress we have. I propose a new system by only letting the American people select our president by votes counted all up by each state, for example if we didn't have have electoral college,\u00a0 then it would be a fair vote because people votes would count the number that adds up with all votes for one candidates that will oppose another candidates and there would be technically no tie it would either ,more or less, but if we still had the electoral college then the vote would not be equally fair becuse if the majority of a state for examlpe\u00a0 chose republican candidate, then that would be vague becuse some people choose democratic and there vote did not really count. but without the electoral collge, than everyones vote counts and each candidates gets vote from every one, not only electoral.  According to source 3, paragraph 18, Richard A. Posner claims that, \"A tie in the nationwide electoral vote is possible because the total number of votes-538- is an even number, but it is highly unlikley...\" There's a shockingly short ammount of votes required to turn an election into a situtation where both canidates have an even number of votes, a problem almost occured in 1976, that were if, according to source #2, paragraph #12, Bradford Plumer, \"a mere 5,559 voters in Ohio and 3687 voters in Hawaii had voted the other way.\" Those may look as if they are big numbers, however in comparison to the amount of voters in each state, these are not large amounts of people who needed to vote the other way. In comparison, the number of representatives is determined by the number of members in your congressional delegation, the amount of electors per state is fair. Still, however, the event of a tie would cause a lot of issues within our country, and would be relieved if the winner was elected by popular vote.   Politics are very lowkey orders of buisness, and in 1960, the legislatures in Louisiana almost used the disaster factor to swing the election in their favor, by electing people who were more likley to vote for the opposer of John F. Kennedy, because they prefered the other canidate. According to source #3, paragraph 16, Posner addresses, \"..each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nomie (and that trust is rarely betrayed\". . . [; however,] it is entirely possible that the winner of the electoral vote will not win the national popular vote.\" Since the electors can technically vote for whoever they desire, it can cause an unfair advantage to the electors sent who vote for the other candiate  According to source one, \"What Is The Electoral College?\", each political party has it's own set of electors that equal the amount of congressional delegates per state. Usually each state has a \"winner-take-all\" method, so the presidential candidate that gets majority in your state will get all of the electors that represent their party, not just most of them. This is beneficicial to the outcome of the election becuase it makes the ability for a candiate to get majority vote much simpler. There is less of a possibility of a tie, or an outcome where no candidate wins. Source 3, \"In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep out despised method of choosing president\", states that \"even a very slight plurality in a state creates a landslide electoral-vote victory in that state...\" , therefore allowing the candidate to secure all votes to their side, instead of having the votes divided on the line of majority rule, and causing rifts between Electoral College voters.   Not one region or state has enough electoral votes to elect a president (Par 19 and 21).\u00a0 This is a good thing because canidates pay equal attention to all of America's people.\u00a0 Also, in the Electoral College, not every state has the same amount of electoral votes because every state has a different population size.\u00a0  As you probably already know, each state's \"...entitled allotment of electors equals the number of memebers in its Congressional delegation...\" (Source One, paragraph 3). Most represntatives spend most of their time campaining in places like New York and California that the small states such as Rhode Island arent even visited. \"In the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see candidates at all...\" and that campaign was refered to as a \"fiasco\" in which the Electoral College caused a dispute (Selection 2, paragraph 13).\u00a0  The electoral College consists of 538 electors, meaning that the possibility of there being a tie is likely.  In  What is the Electoral College?  it states that, \"The Electoral College consists of 538 electors. A majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the president.\" The popular vote can get tied up pretty easily, but it is a lot harder for the electoral votes to get tied up because only 270 votes are needed to elect the president.  In conclusion, the Electoral College and its electors must be disbanded so that popular vote will be used in determining the new president of the United States. According to both Source 2 and 3, the process of voting a group of people to vote for you is un-democratic. Electors, the people making up th Electoral College, can be manipulated and coerced into voting a specific candidate. Lastly, non-swing states will be ignored; this will anger and frustrate them since not one candidate tried to persuade them. Florida State Senator, you must, in the best of your ability and then some, try to topple down the un-democratic roots of the Electoral College. The people, the ones who must truly decide on the president, will be immensely greatful towards you; in a 2000 poll, 60% of the voters even stated that they want a popular-vote type of election. ",

                "content": "The writer claims that Venus is referred to as Earth's \"twin''. But the only evidence he gives to back up this claim is that \"Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of desnity and size.\"  In the second paragraph, the author states \"...Often referred to as Earth's twin, Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size, and occasionally the closest in distance too.\"  He states that Venus is often referred to as Earth's \"twin\". This is because Venus and Earth are close in size, density, and at some points in orbit are the closest planets in the solar system. It is also believed that at one point, Venus was a lot like Earth is now. \"The Challenge of Exploring Venus\" states, \"Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our soloar system.\". The article goes on to say Venus most likely had large oceans that supported life, and the planet has things like craters, valleys, and mountains that we also have here on Earth. The author including these details helps get the point across that Venus is a lot like Earth, and with the little research been done already, we've found so much. This helps readers understand that the longer Venus is studied, the more we will learn about it.  Venus, otherwise known as the \"Evening Star,\" is one of the more challenging planets to examine closely in our solar system. While this plant is often called Earth's twin, it is vastly different in terms of environment and hospitability. Despite being the closest planet to Earth at times, no spaceship has touched down on Venus in over thirty years. The dangers presented by Venus are many, but the author greatly supports the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite these dangers.  That suggests that we already know some facts about Venus such as it's density and size, which is enough to make people curious to how much about Venus we already know. He said that we know that Venus has many similar structures to Earth, such as mountains, valleys, and craters. If Venus is Earth's \"twin,\" doesn't mean that it is extremely similar to Earth? The statement could make people curious about how close Venus really is to Earth, or it could make them wonder why we should bother risking people's safety if we already know that Venus is just like Earth  Venus is the second planet in the solar system from the sun that precedes Earth in the planetary order. This planet is often called Earth's \"twin\" and the \"Evening Star\" of the universe because of its brightness and relative similarity to the Earth. In the article, \"The Challenge of Exploring Venus,\" the author presents facts and figures that one could use to determine whether studying Venus would be an advantageous pursuit even though it would not be very safe. The author focuses more on the drawbacks of exploring Venus, hence the title of this work.  Therefore, the author supports his idea, \"that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents,\" by giving us multiple reasons why we need the knowlage, how it affects us and how we will accomplish that. First, by telling us that Venus is like our twin planet and learning what happened we could adapt. Secondly, by showing us that we are can prevent our own downfall. Lastly, the author tells us how NASA expects to pull this off.  Venus is the closest planet to us in our solar system, which means we should explore it. At least, that is what the author of \"The Challenge of Exploring Venus\" believes.  The author explains points in Venus' history that have intrigued astronomers, \"Long ago, Venus was probably covered largelyt with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, \" (4). Besides having been closer to Earth's \"twin\" many years ago, Venus may be more similar than humans thought, shown through \"The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters,\" (4). Studying Venus could lead to us knowing why this planet is such a far cry from Earth now, and this could provide valuable with how humans interact with their environment. If Venus has such similar features to Earth, like valleys, then there is probably more to discover on Venus' surface. This peculiar connection between this planet and Venus shows how valuable exploration could prove, just as Venus' proximity further supports how worthy of a pursuit Venus is.  This furthers the point more that NASA is also trying to send humans to go visit and study our planet's \"twin\". The author then goes on, proceeding to help our visualization of NASA's plan, telling the reader that NASA would not directly put humans on Venus's surface, but rather have them float in a blimp-like vehicle above the startpoint of Venus's weather and \"avoid the unfriendly ground conditions by staying up ad out of their way.\" The author lastly pointed out how, even with the toasty weather, Venus' surface is still survivable for humans, even though it's not full of easy conditions.

                "content": "In conclusion, the claim about Venus being a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents that the author of \"The Challenges of Exploring Venus\" states is well supported by facts and perfectly thought out ideas. Although Venus is an extremely dangerous planet packed with many reasons as to why exploration is currently held back, NASA is still looking for ways to be able to gain more valuable insight about the Evening Star. Just like the author said, learning and travelling should not be limited by doubts, and scientists will not let doubts and fears stop them.  Multiple times, the author delves into a side-topic as opposed to continuing on with the topic of Venus exploration. They start off the article with two sentences that have no relation to the story, yet confuse readers. The sentences are about Venus' nickname, the \"Evening Star\", and how even though it is a planet, it is still called this. This is completely irrelevant to exploration, as everyone knows it is a planet, and the \"Evening Star\" name is never mentioned again. Later on in the passage, the author rambles on about World War II-age computers and how they functioned properly even before the digital age. Once more, this is slightly irrelevant and does not contribute to the story at all except to add another paragraph instead of focusing on the specifics of how NASA is using them to help with Venus.  Venus is the second planet in the solar system from the sun that precedes Earth in the planetary order. This planet is often called Earth's \"twin\" and the \"Evening Star\" of the universe because of its brightness and relative similarity to the Earth. In the article, \"The Challenge of Exploring Venus,\" the author presents facts and figures that one could use to determine whether studying Venus would be an advantageous pursuit even though it would not be very safe.

While this plant is often called Earth's twin, it is vastly different in terms of environment and hospitability. Despite being the closest planet to Earth at times, no spaceship has touched down on Venus in over thirty years. The dangers presented by Venus are many, but the author greatly supports the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite these dangers.  As the author continues with their argument, readers become increasingly aware that Venus is likely not as beneficial as the author intends to make it seem. With an unlivable biome and dangerous atmospheric conditions, Venus is likely far too hazardous to explore at this time in history, and I believe that the author of this article unwittingly proved so. For these reasons, I believe that the author of this article failed to support their thesis with thorough evidence or detail.        Even though scientists are aware of these difficult factors, people like the author of \"The Challenge of Exploring Venus\" still think that being informed about this bright point of light is worth it.   In coclusion, the authors final claim states, \"Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation.\" Although there are many dangers that could seek upon them, they take them as \"challenges\" and are willing to dig deeper to find out why Venus is the way it is. \"Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth- like planet in our solar system.\" Therefore, this is why the author does a good job by suggesting that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents.     Given these details, he uses useful information that we need to know. In the first paragraph he describes what Venus actually is. If he wasn't to do that, people might be misleaded and still assume that Venus could perhaps be a star. The author gives very useful information to describe what Venus is.  The text also states, \"Venus can sometimes be our nearest option for a planetary visit, a crucial consideration given the long time frames of space travel\" (4). The author uses this sentence to support their idea by explaining how Venus is one of the nearest options to Earth for space travel. Saving travel time is one way Venus shows it is a worthy pursuit. Overall, the author uses the relationship the planets Earth and Venus have with eachother to support their thoughts.  According to the author, \"Venusian geolegy and weather present additional impediments like erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lighting strikes to probes...\" He later stated that NASA has a possible idea to send blimp-like vehicles to travel the surface of Venus, but that would not provide a detailed enough view of the ground. In order to get his point across to the audience, he should not have kept going agianst information ",

In that case, the election would be thrown to the House of Representatives, where state delegations vote on the president. \" Who wants that? What's it even worth voting then if your vote, your vote on the leader of America gets put into the hands of the House Of Representatives to decide on. Think about it.  There is a disaster factor.\u00a0 According to \"Source 2: The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong\", it's says that the state legislatures are responsible for picking electors. The thing is that those electors can betray the trust which has happened before. You do not want to risk having someone defy the will of the people.  Source 2, Bradford Plumer, The indefensible electoral college: why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong, P. 11, line 44) Imagine if the corrupters had been able to corrupt the election, we might have had a fiasco bigger than the 2000 presidential fiasco. If we were to continue to turn our backs on the matter we would soon be run by fatasses who spent all their time gaming and would claim they know exactly how the sytem works, opposed to a real man who spent all his time rising from the bottom up and knows the system by heart. Who do you think would win if those 2 people were to run for President? Not the one who should.  No system is perfect, and the Electoral College is not exempt from this. \"The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong\", Source 2, argues that a term called 'disaster factor', or the possibility of immenent disaster due to the Electoral College system, is why the Electoral College system should be abolished  The Declaration of Independence granted us the right to control our government. Thomas Jefferson once stated, \"When a nations government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the right of its people to abolish it and establish a new government.\" After viewing the articles Source 1:\"What Is the Electoral College?\" by the Office of the Federal register, Source 2: \"The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong\" by Bradford Plumer, and\u00a0 Source 3:\"In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President\" by Richard A. Posner it seems clear that the Electoral Colleges have lessened the power of the people in our nation. With the Electoral College method of selecting our nations new president the people of our nation become less empowered, they may cast their vote but the choice of president is never truly theirs. The Electoral Colleges drive people away from voting because they see the election as if their vote will not matter.  In The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong by Bradfor Plumer, Plumer explains that one of the best arguments against the Electoral College is that the rate of disaster is so high. In 2000, there was a elctoral crisis based upoun the Electoral College, because Al Gore recieved more individual votes, but George W. Bush still won the election.  In the article called What Is The Electoral College\", by the office of the Federeal register it quoted most states have a winner-take-all system that awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate. In the other article\u00a0 \"The indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong' ,by Bradford Plumer it quoted , candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the swing states. Electoral\u00a0 college is a unfair process because of the winner take it all. The winner takes it all system is a unfair process for the American citizens. even with a slightly change in the electoral college could change the tide or even cause a tie in the election.   The article \"The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong\" written by Bradford Plumer states, \"The single best argument against the electoral college is what we might call the disaster factor. The American people should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century; the sytem allows for much worse. Consider that state legislators are technically responsible for picking electors, and that those electors could always defy the will of the people\". This means that the people never know if their electors are going to go back on their word and vote for another candidate.  For example, in \"The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong,\" Bradford Plumer whines about how, \"At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters,\" going on to say that, \"Because of the winner-take-all system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the 'swing' states,\" (Plumer 13).

If my co-workers and I thought this was actually proof of alien life, why would we hide it from you? What is the point in hiding that kind of information?  The \"face\" isn't any perticular shape that any man or alien would want. The landform would be shaped as a circle, square or any other simple shape, and it would not be so ridgid and cracked. If you were to look at the photo furthest to the left, you would assume that it resembled a face, but If you compair that photo to the one taken twenty-five years later, you would begin to understand that to photo was out-dated and that the camera was not as clear as the one taken later. In addition, why would an alien make a structure of a human's face.   In conclusion, some people may think there is alien life on Mars because of past picture or conspiracy theories. No one can denty however, that NASA has proven the Face to be nothing but a natural landform on the Red Planet Mars. NASA has proven this by recent pictures, scientific evidence, and real-life examples and measurements. Over the years, NASA has worked hard to figure out the mystery of the face, and just recently they have discovered, with pictyures, evidence, and measruements, that the Face is just a natural landform with unusual shadowing formed on the Red Planet Mars.  There you have it. The Face sadly wasn't built by aliens, it was just a natural landform that happened to have some pretty neat features to it due to shadows. There is no way around it, because the pictures don't lie. It is even more obvious that it is a landform because ones just like it exist on Earth! Even though it would've been very interesting for it to have been actually created by aliens, it was just a natural landform in the end.  In conclusion, NASA is either brave or very stupid not to tell people about their \"face\", or people just want to get their word out to make other people critisized, make other people feel stupid, or they just want to feel like they are correct when they are clearly not. Therefore; This \"so called face\" is not a face, but it is just a land mark that was naturally constructed by the elements and not alien life-forms.  The Face is nothing but a landmass, the scientific name: A mesa.  In 1976 the face looked like a face. In 1998 it started to not look like a face at all. In 2001 it just looked like a rock. So i believe that it was not created by aliens but that it was just something the olanet had made itself. This has certainly got the attention of the people.  The \"Face on Mars\" is not a face. If you look at the pictures from 1976, and 1998, and 2001 and in the text it says that the photo from 2001 is the most recent photo that NASA has. It still looks nothing like a face so since the 2001 picture is the most recent it shows that it is just a natural landform. It is just a natural landform. On Mars there are natural landforms everywhere and the fade away. Here on earth natural landforms are created everyday.  In 1976 NASA released a photo of a landform on Mars resembling a human face. Not everyone was easily convinced that it was only just a landmass though. Conspiracy theorists believed that it was, \"Bona fide evidence of life on Mars.\" In the article \"Unmasking the Face on Mars,\" the author, Garvin, believed that it was only a mesa.  The curiousity about Mars has been going on for centuries.  People say that there is or once was life on Mars, and now they are saying that there is a face on Mars.  Humans all around the world have questioned whether the \"Face\" was created by aliens or just a natural landform.  Aliens never made the Face of Mars and the Face of Mars isn't real at all! It's just a natural landform by having the shadows covering up most of the landform making it appear as a face. For the conclusion, Cydonia has a natural landform on it that appears itself as a face using the shadows to make the illusion. ",

                "content": "Different people may know certain things about the decision that you need to make. Asking for advice from these people will allow you to gain this information and make a better choice. A study from Harvard University found that when given the choice, 99% of people chose to make a decision with advice from multiple strangers who has had to make the same decision before. Out of that 99%, 98% believed that the choice they made was the best for them. They also believed that the knowledge they gained from talking to the strangers was a big contributing factor to their success. This study shows how truly beneficial advice from others is. It not only helped people make the best decision possible, but also provided new information for the decision maker, who can now pass on that knowledge to others who need help from someone with experience.  When asking for advice, it is better to ask multiple people than to just ask one person. This is because asking more than one person leads to hearing more points of view, having more discussion about a problem, and thinking about a problem for longer. Asking one person for advice will limit a decision and it may lead to someone making a bad decision. Asking multiple people for advice can lead somebody to become more open minded about a problem, or even life in general. For these many reasons, asking multiple people for advice is the best way to find a solution to a problem or situation.   When people ask for advice, they should always seek more than one opinion because the people they ask could have different past experience, be biased, or have different opinions about the matter. When asking for an opinion in something, always ask different people and different kinds of people. People can have different opinions about things and be biased. Asking biased people for an opinion on something is never good so that is why people ask more than one individual before they make an important choice. In conclusion, this is why people need to get multiple opinions before they make a big choice.  Why is it more beneficial to seek multiple opinions when making a decision? When people ask for advice, they are usually conflicted about something, or don't know what to do. The reason that one person asks for advice could be because they don't know what shoes to wear, or it could be because they need advice about something bigger, like what house to buy. Either way, they are still seeking other people's opinions. When you are asking a person for advice, you want a definite answer. You could ask one person for advice about what shoes to wear, and they could say black, and then you could ask someone else for advice about the same thing, and they could say a different answer.  In conclusion, asking for advice from multiple people can help a person make the best choice possible. Whether it is an easy or a hard decision everyone needs advice at somepoint and asking more than one person can help decision making. If someone needs help deciding between two things, or thinking of a solution to their problem, asking multiple people can make their decision a little easier. With all the decisions people make in life, making every decision as easy as possible is the best thing people can do.\u00a0\u00a0  When people ask for advice, I have noticed that it can be awkward, or even embarrassing. Some people may have specific people they go to for advice, such as a parent, sibling, close friend, teacher, and many more. But going to more than one can be even more beneficial. Personally, I think that asking people for advice can help you make a better choice, because the people you ask have most likely been in the same situation as you.  when people ask for advice, talking to more than one person can help you make the better choice. You can learn how to make the better choice most suitable for yourself when you talk to people who may have more experience and wisdom than you, and more people will be able to give their own ideas and inputs into the situation to help you look at the decision to be made in many different ways and perspectives. Finally, asking many people what they would do in the same scenario tells you if there might be a clear majority leaning towards one choice. Having a clear majority lets you know that this is what most people would do in the same situation, which leads you to feeling more comfortable and confident after making that decision. Though many people have to make difficult decisions throughout their lives, asking more people for advice in this decision will lead them into making the right one for themselves.  asking multiple people for advice can be really helpful to most, if not, all people. It is never easy approaching a problem by yourself which is why you should always ask for help. Asking others for advice can sometimes be the best option because you have more options to choose from while in the decision making process, you can make a decision easier and quicker, and you can arrive to an overall smarter choice from others.  If only one person is asked for advice, then there will be only one time where it is discussed. When multiple people are asked for advice, it will take up a longer amount of time, and will most likely be at different times and days. This is good because people can change their minds very quickly, and what someone thinks of their situation one day, might not be what they think of it the next day. When more people are asked for advice, all of the time it takes to ask them can be used to deliberate and decide which decision may be the best. When asking one person for advice, someone may only think of a solution to a problem over the course of one day. When asking multiple people, it could require someone to think of a solution for multiple days. This will make sure they think of all possible decisions and outcomes, so they don't make a spontaneous decision.  Listening to multiple options, knowing the pros and cons of each side, and relieving decision-making stress are all reasons why you should ask more than one person for advice. You always want to make the right choice, especially for bigger decisions like buying a house. Getting to know all your options and the pros and cons of each is very important for making the best choice for you. However, this could be very stressful and asking all your friends for advice will make sure you feel supported and less stressed. ",

So in the future it is much recommended that you seek more than just one persons opinion on a situation your not so sure about.\u00a0  Getting more than one opinion can be very helpful since it gives you more outlook on the question at hand  Seeking multiple opinions will help them decide which opinions they would prefer to help them pick from. This person could have a number of options to decide from so that they will get more ideas for the advice they could recieve. Asking for advice from one person is not a very good way for getting opinions, because that person will not have as many options as a great deal of people could have. The person getting advice should not decide on one person to get opinion from because they might not get as many ideas as they would like to get. Having more opinions to influence from can make up a huge decision for a person that is seeking more to options.  One way seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice is that by asking more than one person, they can get more input.  There are many reasons why someone should ask multiple people for advice including getting a more educated answer and receiving different opinions. Asking more than one person would provide someone with better advice and a variety of answers. Whether somebody asks two or five people, all of the answers that are given will lead them to make better choices.  Having multiple opinions is important, but also just having someone to talk to can be just as important for having advice.  The next reason is having someone to talk to, this can help you for multiple reasons like getting better advice and being happy  Its give's you more option's, people who have already been their can be the most helpful, and overall having a second opinion can be more helpful than you know. And having more option's than you need can help you weather it's a big decision or a little one. And having more can help you pick out the one's you dont need and help you find the one's you do need. And you may find out that what someone said really helped you and you may go back to the for more advice and it's just a never ending loop to help you everyday.\u00a0 \u00a0  Advice is an opinion, opinions have bias in them. Asking more that one person can help cut down that bias by adding other opinions in to a big pool making one bias less of a influence\u00a0then what is was before you got more opinions, making your choice\u00a0more accurate  Asking for more than one persons advice and opinions on a subject is a great way to make the best choice about something.  In conclusion, seeking multiple people's opinions is more beneficial than only seeking one. You can face the situation knowing you did the best you could to prepare for it. Next time you you resort to only asking one person for advice, think twice because it will be helpful to talk to people who have experienced your situation, you will have more ways to overcome an unexpected challenge, and you can let all of your emotions out to everyone.\u00a0\u00a0 ",

                "content": "When discussing the exploration of Venus, most people are turned off by its reputation as a dangerous and challenging planet for humans to study. While the author doesn't stray away from these harsh extremities, they make sure to prove how these details seem insignificant and how safe travel can still be executed. The author thoroughly describes the plan provided by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) to allow astronauts to float above the fray and avoid the hazardous conditions. They provide specific qualities of the plan, such as the air pressure being close to the sea level on Earth, the abundance of solar power, and the containment of radiation, to prove how humans would be kept in a safe atmosphere. They even provide a real world connection between NASA's possible solution and a blimp-like vheicle hovering around the ground to make it easier for the audience to understand. The author combats the speculaiton of Venus being too dangerous to explore in order to further support the idea of it being a worthy pursuit.  With Sulfuric Acid in Venus' atmosphere, and surface temperatures being over 425 degrees Celcius (about 700 K or 800 F) , the likelyhood of humans on Venus is nearly nonexistent to begin with. To combat the hot temperatures and the acidic atmosphere, NASA proposed the idea of a \"blimp\" that floats above the planet's shell. Although the blimp could survive high in the air, the practicality of if is not present. Having a blimp that cannot touch the planet is not going to help scientific research at all. While being above the clouds of Venus, it is impossible to see the surface with human eyes. Seeing the surface would require technology that uses light from the electromagnetic spectrum with a high frequency and short wavelength. It is also impossible to collect rock samples from the planet for soil examination. This idea would not be beneficial enough for the risk of investing a lot of time and money.  The author states, \"NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray.\". Stating ways that Venus can be studied with people not being put in danger helps get the authors point across. The article also touches on how floating above the surface could keep those studying the planet safe. Temperatures would still be high, but nothing the spacecraft couldn't handle, the air pressure would be like how it is on Earth at sea level, soloar power would be bountiful, and radiation would be no higher than the levels on Earth. The text then states, \"Not easy conditions, but survivable for humans.\". Although this would not be an easy job, it is possible to study Venus safely. The details used in this paragraph help convey the authors point that studying Venus can be done safely and that it should continue to happen.  The author says NASA has an idea on how to send humans to study Venus, \"...possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray\" (Paragraph 5). The ship would hover above, avoiding the dangerous conditions by remaining away from it. Allowing the scientists to be close enough to study some elements of Venus, and to have more context on how to understand it more, without a human possibly dying. To further support this, the author states, \"...hovering safely far above the planet can provide only limited insight...\" (Paragrah 6). The author is aware that hovering is not the most effectove technique, but he supports the idea by hinting it will still be worth it because information can still be gathered, despite the limits.  When explaining NASA's ideas on sending humans to Venus, the author states, \"NASA\u0092s possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray.\" This provides evidence that shows what a solution is to avoiding some of the difficulties that occur when trying to explore Venus. The author was able to support his idea throught the use of NASA and it's research. The passage continues to come up with a plan on the best way to float above Venus when the author says, \"At thirty-plus miles above the surface, temperatures would still be toasty at around 170 degrees Fahrenheit, but the air pressure would be close to that of sea level on Earth.\" This factual evidence that is included ensures that the author is supporting this idea to the fullest of his potential. Researched and factual evidence that is provided all throughout the passage shows how the author supports this idea thoroughly and well.  As stated in the text, the conditons on the planet are \"far more extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth.\" Even with advanced technology that we have today, the article states that \"no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours.\" If the technology we have today can't even survive the conditions on Venus, how are humans supposed to be able to? Even though the author claims the conditions are \"not easy, but survivable for humans,\" the temperature can climb up to over 800 degrees Fahrenheit. These pieces of evidence from the excerpt convey the idea that Venus and its characteristics are far too dangerous for humans to even go near.  People have studied the many planets in our solar system and are fastinated by them. People have also studied the solar system to help explore and give information about the planets around us. One planet that scientists have studied for a good amount of time is Venus since it shows that at one time, the planet might have inhabited living organisms. However, Venus is a very dangerous planet since many attempts of landing spacecraft has failed on Venus and the clouds of the planet are made of sulfuric acid. Venus is not worth the pursuit of knowledge since the planet has a very dangerous enviorment for humans and that not a single spacecraft has landed safely on the planet and returned.  From the example stated earlier, regaurding the extreme conditions in Venus, the author was able to provide a logical solution to the weather without using any opinions. The author wrote,\"NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow sceintists to float above the fray.\" The author then goes onto describe NASA's plan in full depth, and going into fine detail about the floating contraption that would suspend the astronauts safely above the harsh atmosphere of Venus. They then state, \"Not easy conditions, but survivable for humans.\" The author is displaying a solution for the conditions, and even the minor flaws it has. The author going into detail about the solution for the extreme conditions in Venus and even conceding a bit when saying, \"Not easy conditions but survivable for humans,\" helps argue their point. They affectively refuted the counter-arguements by using factual evidence in their rebutal, and deemed themselves trustworthy by the opposing side by even conceding slightly on a few issues.  Exploring Venus would a beinificail and woth while scientific endver. Over the years Venus has been a topic of study due to its earth like qualites. The temperature of Venus is not as freindly to humans as our own atmosphereVenus is one the closest planets to own planet than most others. Lastly, the exploration of venus can be the next ground breaking scientific discovery yet.  but in reality, Earth and Venus are very differnet. Earth is much safer in terms of temperature, pressure, and gas compaired to Venus. Venus has a blanket of gas that covers it that is, \"almost 97 percent carbon dioxide.\" Plus, on its surface, \"temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit.\" with the level of carbon dioxide and the ragging heat that it has, nothing is safe for long on Venus, especially humans. He does state that several spacecrafts have attempted to land on Venus, and only lasted a few hours, but he doesnt state what happened to them. most people would guess that they just melted entirely because of the extreme heat, which is most likely what happened, but we don't know for sure.

While computers were made to help us, it cannot be our only source of information. On the other hand, teachers are st school for the sole purpose of helping you learn. It is their actual job to be there to help you learn things. While computers are a tool to help achieve this goal, there are other ways to learn about things and get them explained to you.  When you are in highschool, many teachers and parents will say things to you along the lines of \"In the real world\" and \" Highschool is preparing you for the real world\". Later on in life, \"in the real world\", if you get bored at a job you cannot just change what you are doing. You have to continue on with it because it is your job. If we implemented this system now in schools, many kids and teens would get in their mindset that if they are bored or don't understand something, things will change for them. Kids should not rely on a computer to help them understand everything. There are teachers, classmates, parents, and other adults who can help.  In conclusion, The use of FACS in a classroom enviroment sounds like a great idea but when you put it in different catagories it fails in almost every one of them you dont need a computer to read emotions when a human is perfectly capable of know how you feel even if it is just a little bit. The schools will need more funding diverted to even run the program and keep it working when schools already have a budget that they have to work on and they will need to be prepared to do something if the power goes out because that system will not run if it has incffecient power.  The age of computers is inescapable, but it doesn't have to be. Instead of computer analyzed emotional connection, people should put their phones down and ask each other how they are. Not every person wants their emotions analyzed, especially in schools. Students bonds with teachers are simply student to teacher; a child must trust an adult before they talk about their feelings. Computer facial technology might be helpful, but not in schools. This technology falls flat in the category of connection. Don't take the easy way out, instead of analyzing emotions with a computer, ask someone how they are. If a student looks upset, sit down and talk with them. Show someone they are valuable and deserve one on one human interaction  More and more frequently, classrooms across the country are embracing technology. From laptops distributed to the student body to 3D printers, technology changes, and education changes with it. Today, the United States is at a point where it can safely be said that, most likely, every school in the country has computers. This is an era of communication unlike the world has ever seen. Some schools even allow distance learning via online and video conferencing. A common question asked is \"Is home learning a good thing?\" To answer that question, not exactly.  Have you ever asked someone for advice? If yes, then you know it can be a good thing. Asking for advice means to get other people's take on different options and seeing others choices. For example, teenagers ask for advice on their Instagram photos and their outfits all of the time. It helps them decide what they want to post or wear. Also, just know that there are no strict rules on how or what to ask advice for either, it is a very casual thing  If many people say to not do something then the person knows that majority of people agree it will only do them harm. It is the same for the things a person should do. If many people have the same advice then they know that it's the right thing to do. Indecisiveness is prevalent in many people. Having several voices present\u00a0should enforce the person to make a decision. Someone can also put together all of the advice they get and find the common denominator of the advice. Making the person self assured about following the advice people gave, because so many of their peers thought the same way. You can tweak all of the advice to create a better idea or a stronger piece of advice. Usually your own advice is best for yourself, so adding other people's advice to your own can help you make a greater choice.  They will help you choose the best way to handle the situation. It always makes me feel better when the person giving me advice knows how to help me. The person can tell you if your choice is the best or not. You will most likely feel better after getting \"the okay\" from another person. Talking to a trusted person will make you feel more comfortable, especially knowing you aren't getting lied to. By then you will feel ready to make a great choice. Knowing if your decision is good or not, being told how to handle it, and talking to someone who won't lie to you will truly help you decide on a better choice.  Not all advice given is automatically good. Let's say, for example, you are planning to redecorate your bedroom. Someone offers a neon-yellow pillow for your chair. You think to yourself, no way . Someone else tells you to hang up squares cut out from cardboard around the border of the entrance. You think, huh, that's not such a bad idea , until you ask one more person. They suggest that you declutter your shelf and invest in new curtains for a clean and bright look. Brilliant! The third suggestion is far better than the rest.  Computers don't have emotions, but you do! Imagine technology that seriously works for you, not only at home but also in the classroom! If technology could accurately read human facial expressions the learning possibilities could be endless. For example, think about that one story that you're forced to read that you just can't understand and brings out all your frustrations, with facial expression recognition you probably will never be so frustated again.

However, if their grades fall below that mark, they will need to participate. This ensures that the kids who do not do the community service are spending enough of their time on schoolwork. As the principal, motivating kids to achieve higher in school should appeal to you.  I strongly disagree with the idea of making all students participate in extracurricular activities. If the students want to participate, then they can. If they don't want to participate or join, then they shouldn't have to. With how crowded it would be, the loss of homework time it would bring, and stress causing it would create, I don't believe that students should be forced into that. I believe the students should be given the choice, and if some of them don't accept, try to convince others. Instead of making them all participate, ask them what activities they like and improve the clubs or create new clubs based on their opinions  Therefore, I'm sure these students don't have the time after school to do community service. If those kids had to do community service, it would most likely add stress to their lives and give them less time to do homework, so their grades could begin to slip. On the weekends is when kids relax and have fun with their friends and family, so it wouldn't be a good idea to make community service time on the weekend.   So do you rather, making it a priority for your students to do community service or not? Do you rather them miss out on part of their education just to clean a field or to read to little children? Isn't that why we have teachers? Or do you want your students to be mad at their principle because there's not time to hang out or get all their energy out? Take it from me a student myself, you should let students have time to hang out its the best thing for kids our age. Making kids do community service may take that time up. Don't make it a priority for community service! Community service is not that big a deal!  think that if you didn't have the students at our school do community service you would be doing them a great injustice. When we are so privileged to have a nice home, clean water, and a meal on the table every night we should at least be able to go out for an our or two and help someone else who isn't as privileged. Its hardly a great burden to get up from the computer or desk you are at, put on a pair of old jeans and a t-shirt, and go out and help. So I ask only one thing of you; please set aside one day, one measly day, to have all of the students in our school wander out into the community and help someone.  They could have a job after school, plus have to do all of the homework required by your teachers. If you force students to perform a service, they might not be able to reach there highest point academically because they're so bogged down with a to-do list. Students would get too stressed out with everything they have to do. Stress isn't good physically or mentally, and that could cause grades to go down. Not having to do community service would give students more time for studying and other things like an after-school sport or club. If you want more kids to participate in extra-curricular things, you can't add another burden onto their shoulders. You know what they say, All work and no play...  If all 8th graders had to do it then it would not bring out the best in them and would be dreaded by some.  Supporting this, the whole 8th grade of 120 students have to do an hour of community service a day. 40 out of the 120 do not like the labor and dread it, causing them to have the thought of community service in their heads the whole day. This would cause changes in attitudes throughout daily life . In addition, it would lead to bad attitudes towards helping the community and bad habits for the future.  What these kids are saying is, on a rough estimation, in 3,600 hour school year the don't have just 10 hours of that time to give back to their community? I find that pretty hard to believe, and I hope you would to. I have to agree that students lives are very full these days, but the can make time for their community that makes there lives full. On my opinion on refusing to do community service is either the person is lazy, or just plain mean. The students may not realize it not, but community is definitely worth their time. After doing community service, the students will have a satisfying feeling, knowing they did something good, and benefited their community. You never know, they just might like community service.   If you get behind my idea, I know students and teachers will follow us and make a huge difference in our community.  We could even send out e-mails to each student's parents telling them of this idea.  If the parents find out about this, I believe they will certainly force their kids to take part in a small amount of community service.  All I am asking from you, is to just enforce this one little rule into our school.  It could change lives.  I am not asking for everybody to do a whole lot, just 24 hours of your life to help out the community.  There are so many opportunities for our students to help out our community.  Who knows, maybe you could save somebody's life while doing the community service.   If they're always doing community service, when will the students be able to have time to enjoy for themselves. Doing community service takes a lot of time out of a persons day. If there was a test a student had to take the next day after doing community service when schools over and if that student spent a lot of time to do that, then when that student got home, he would be restless and probably wouldn't have enough time to study for that test. I just don't think that community service is healthy for a lot of kids learning environments ",

                "content": "The author mentions, \"More importantly, researchers cannot takes samples of rock, gas, or anything else, from a distance.\" Although this may be a challenge, the author states that many researchers are working on innovations that would allow their machines to last long enough to contribute meaningfully to their knowledge of Venus. In paragraph 7, it states that NASA is working on other approaches to studying Venus, and that it is possible and worthy of doing so. One project is looking back to an old technology called mechanical computers. \"By comparison, systems that use mechanical parts can be made more resistant to pressure, heat and other forces.\"  When talking about something as dangerous as exploring another planet, it is easy to see that our Earth bound technology simply cannot do the job. in paragraph 5 of the article, the author describes an idea that was thought up by \"The National Aeronautics and Space Administartion\". This idea is to have humans 30 or so miles above Venus for exploration. The author claims how this would be beneficial in keeping humans safe from the Venusian landscape. However, The author does not support this idea well, as he goes on to say how not much exploration can be done from there, and the conditions would still be extremely dangerous but \"survivable\". Also in paragraph 7, the author explains how NASA is working on other approaches to study Venus. He explains how they are working on some simplified electronics, made of silicon carbide, that have been testedd in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface. This may sound like a good thing, but it is far from one. This is because the author finsihes by saying that the electronics lasted only three weeks. If a computer can't withstand Venus's conditions longer than three weeks, I am very doubtful that a human can. This proves my point that our technology is far too inadvanced for such a task like exploring another planet. Therefore supporting my claim that the author did a poor job in supporting this idea.  NASA's advancements for Venus exploration are promising, \"For example, some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface and have lasted for three weeks in such chaos,\" (7). Humans would not be able to use the most advanced technology, but durability is the goal, \"By comparison, systems (mechanical computers that use gears and levers to calculate) that use mechanical parts can be made more resistant to pressure, heat, and other forces,\" (7). If humans were to only hover over Venus, the possibilites are limited. Humans and technology have to be as close as possible. Technology that could last for a few weeks is enough to vastly expand our knowledge. Mechanical computers are now obsolete, but in Venus would be a valuable tool, just like the other electonics being made. Researchers have worked tirelessly to continue making Venus exploration a reasonable reality.  The author stated that NASA is working on an approach to studying Venus that involves mechanical computers. He then said, \"The thought of computers existing in those days may sound shocking, but these devices make calculations by using gears and levers...\" It is irrelevant to the message when the mechanical computers were envisioned or the fact that it is shocking to hear that computers existed in 1940. It was hard to understand why computers were important to the article at all. The author made it difficult to focus on the message when he was stating random facts that were not important to the idea he was trying to support.  The author also states, \"Some simplified electronics... have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface and have lasted for three weeks in such conditions\" (7). The author backs up her idea by using these electronics, that can survive three weeks on venus, to once again show that we can get through to venus. Science and technology being able to help us properly function on Venus shows that the planet is a worthy pursuit. Ultimately, the author backs up her idea by giving evidence on the different ways landing on Venus is possible.  Some issues still remain for the exploration, however NASA has already started preparing solutions. The heated state of the planet may be an issue, but NASA is studying a resolution. Paragraph 7 reads, \"For example, some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface and have lasted for three weeks in such conditions\" (The Challenge of Exploring Venus). This new technology created could lead to a long-lasting basis for human life, yet another reason exploring Venus is a brilliant idea. Modern technology is too fragile for the harsh heat of the planet, but with some older computers, that as well could survive on Venus. Paragraph 7 reads, \"The thought of (mechanical) computers existing in those days may sound shocking, but these devices make calculations by using gears and levers and do not require electronics at all. Modern computers are enormously powerful, flexible, and quick, but tend to be more delicate when it comes to extreme physical conditions\" (The Challenge of Exploring Venus). This is yet another piece of technology on Earth and prepared for Venus  The second issue is safety. According to NASA, they have a solution for getting a spaceship to Venus carefully and safely. \"Imagine a blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the roiling Venusian landscape. Just as our jet airplanes travel at a higher altitude to fly over many storms, a vehicle hovering over Venus would avoid the unfriendly ground conditions by staying up and out of their way. At thirty-plus miles above the surface, temperatures would still be toasty at around 170 degrees Fahrenheit, but the air pressure would be close to that of sea level on Earth. Solar power would be plentiful, and radiation would not exceed Earth levels. Not easy conditions, but survivable for humans.\" (paragraph 5). NASA has a soultion for the safety issue that was recently brought to their attention. The people who want to go and explore Venus now believe that this is one of the final steps toward actually getting off of the ground. If NASA trains astronauts well enough, tries to simulate the conditions on Venus, and everything works well; there is noting holding them back.  There are a lot of astronauts in NASA that are willing to take on the challenge to Venus and NASA has already been simulatiing prototypes to withstand the conditions similar to Venus  This means there is a worthy reason to explore Venus; to discover another habitable planet. Along with successful life on Venus, our modern technology could also survive the planet. Paragraph 5 states, \"Imagine a blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the roiling Venusian landscape. Just as our jet airplanes travel at a higher altitude to fly over many storms, a vehicle hovering over Venus would avoid the unfriendly ground codnitions by staying up and out of their way\" (The Challenge of Exploring Venus). Moreover, if airplanes are already in existence, new aircrafts would need to be slightly adjusted to suit the conditions of Venus. The author's claim is supported in this quote because this is another reason Venus is worth exploring. The technology needed is already almost perfect for the planet, therefore not a problem NASA would have to approach.  The author gave an entire paragraph about the new technologies that NASA is working on to explore Venus, even though his main idea is about why we should send shuttles to Venus. In the article it states \" Another project is looking back to an old technology called mechanical computers. These devices were first envisioned in the 1800s and played an important role in the 1940s during World War II\". This entire quote has nothing to do with the topic whatsoever, which shows that the author was gettting side tracked. One reading just this quote from the article would most likely think this article is about computers,and not why humans should explore Venus. ",

                "content": "I don't remember the material from my psychology summer assignment this year. All we had to do was research and write about a basic concept from psychology. I do, however, remember the Latin project I did in seventh grade. I think this is because I was allowed to do the project on anything related to Latin that I wanted. All my teacher asked of us was that the project was somehow Latin related. I decided to do my project on ancient roman customs, specifically the different rituals performed as a person reaches certain ages. From that project I remember things like that at six months old a young roman boy gets a round pendant called a bulla to protect them from evil spirits and when they reach age twelve the receive a new type of toga and more. I could not tell you about the five methods of observation used in psychology, which is what my summer assignment this year (11th grade) was about.  For example, in elementary school, students come up with their own experiments to test, after which they present their findings at the science fair. By doing so, students learn how to depend on themselves to find information. Similarly, sophomores at the Generic_School take a research class. They work on a wide variety of projects that are mostly assigned by teachers, but towards the end of the year, they must come up with an independent research project that they will work on in their junior year. In order to choose their project, students have to conduct extensive research to understand the topic, as their project cannot have been done before. Additionally, they have to continue conducting research in junior year to allow for a wider understanding of the topic. This allows the students to be self-reliant, as they know more about their project than their teacher, who acts as a mentor. Self-reliance is a very important skill that helps people succeed in the community and workplace when they become an adult, so it is important to establish the skill early on.  Material that has been researched by the student and completed on their own has been proven to show greater results in the grade attached to the project. When an assignment has been handed to a student to complete that has been created by someone else, they are likely only to do the minimum of what has been assigned. By doing this they are not able to gain full knowledge of the topic and fully understand what is going on  For my psychology summer assignment, I was lazy during the summer and did not want to do it, but eventually I did it the day before they school year started and learned nothing because it was boring and I wanted to get it over with. However, if the assignment was to research anything I wanted about psychology, perhaps it could have turned out like my 7th grade Latin assignment and I would've actually learned something. From personal experience I can say that the best way to combat an apathetic student is to gain their interest somehow, which could be done by allowing them the freedom to design their own project. For example, I loved reading  Frankenstein in English, but after having to write so much about it I no longer like it and don't really remember much of what happened.  Even if a subject is interesting, the desire to do a project on it can be crushed by the formatting of the project. Allowing students to do whatever format they want could make students gain interest and want to learn more about a subject compared to doing something they don't want, like writing an essay, which may make them harbor resentment toward the subject instead.  . Because of this reason, students are more likely to actively work on the project and put in more effort. For example, my AOS biology class was assigned a project to research and present information about a group of proteins. We were allowed to present this information in any way we wanted, allowing for creativity. The majority of the students were very excited to work on the project, as they thought of fun ways to present their information. Some students created songs to relay their information, whereas others made fun videos to do so. A few students even baked cakes to provide information about their proteins. Each student actively worked on their project and put in effort to make sure it was done well. The element of creativity allowed the students to see the assignment as a fun project, rather than as a boring task. Because the majority of the students worked hard on the project, they did well on it. Furthermore, they effectively retained the information they researched, allowing them to do well on the corresponding test.  Recently I have begun to research the difference in effect on the people of Ameirca, between the Electoral College and the result of popular cote for President. I have found out that our founding fathers created the Electoral College in the Constitution, so that while the votes between Congress and the people may be different, ther could be a compromise. Our country; well our world, is evolving with the changes in generation. 2015 has come upon us, and with this year brings a whole new change in cutural diversity and tehcnology. So while I believe sticking to our coutry's Constitution is vital for some reasons, I also believe it is outdated in others.  This would give them an opportunity to research something that they don't already know anything about.  Often students cannot pursure their interests because of all their other responsibilities.  Many students cannot take the classes that they wish to take becuase they have other classes that they are required to complete in order to graduate.  Becuase there is no determined subject of the project, the students will have the rare chance to research whatever they want to.  This could even be a time where the students could learn something that is not taught in school at all.\u00a0This also applies to classes that they may be taking that they do not do many projects in.  This would give them the chance to use and display the knowledge that they already have.  Similarly to the style of projects, upon seeing all of the topics that interest the students, the teachers may be inclined to add some of the topics to their curriculum, which would once again encourage the students to be more interested in their classes.  When one student is interested in something, it is more than likely that other students will be the same.  Though it is important for students to work with topics that are already somewhat familiar to them, it's also very important for students to step outside of their comfort zone into something entirely new.  When a student begins learning about a topic with an open mind and a goal to learn, they may find more than a project, they may find a passion.  It's very important to allow students to explore new interests while still in highschool.  Being in the smae routine for years may put a student into the mindset that they should not change what they are already doing, or it could even discourage students from pursuing new interests.  It is important that students find these interests so that they will have an idea of what they want to do when they go to college, or when they step out into the world as adults.  Cooperation is a skill which gives people the ability to build upon each others strengths and weaknesses, and is the source of many significant discoveries. Often we see that the scientific community caters to its researchers by promoting peer-reviewed journals and research to be conducted. This sentiment holds true with education in America. In order for students to learn over the summer, they should be encouraged to produce their own projects with individuals whom they spend their time with during the summer. I recall being pestered by taking on the burden of conducting a lab report by myself, which caused me to feel stressed out and disengaged. One day in physics class, my teacher allowed me to conduct a lab with many of my friends to make the lab procedure dynamic. I found that by being with my contemporaries, I was inclined to learn more about physics, and to collect accurate and precise data. Students who create their own projects are allowed the opportunity to learn through cooperation, which betters suits them especially during summer break. Many students are already flustered by the work load they receive during the school year, furthermore projects in summer break should bring students together in learning not steer them away in frustration.  In a study conducted by Stanford University, scientists found that humans are proven to perform best and make the best decisions when working in a group of people. My mom has always told me that more brains are better than one, and I would have to agree with her. In the past, I have made poor decisions on my own, but when I ask somebody for a second opinion or idea I am able to use what they tell me to improve my own ideas.  when I was in 6th grade I had a summer project of choosing an influential president and explaining what that president did for the country. At the time, I was interested in science instead of history. As a result, this project seemed lackluster and an arduous task to complete over my summer break. However, if I had been given the opportunity to choose a topic that interests me, I would have found the summer project exponentially more exciting and something to look forward to. Many students feel the same way about this, as they wish to choose the topic they will research and create a solution to. Therefore, it is evident that summer projects should be student-designed so that students can have a genuine interest in the project they are completing. ",

Everyone needs to be flexible, and try to help out the community for a change. It should be required, and every student should be able to handle a little community services. Thank you for taking the time to read this.  I have read and heard your argument about all students taking place in community service by mandatory rule. No disrespect to you sir, but I have to firmly disagree with this idea.  I think you should require all students to perform community service because many students laze around with nothing to do, when they could be helping the community.  In my opinion, all students should perform community service.  In my opinion, i think you should make all students perform some type of community service.  In conclusion, my point is not to require students for community service. Because it's just of course like forcing us again. For what I heard , slavery wasn't allowed in United States. We should get the right to do as we may, according to the law. Not everything , but in this case, we have the right to say no for educated students to perform community service by will. Some good may take in this course, but not all good. Though you think it'll be good for us students, learn some things. But for us, it's unfair and cruel. Somehow if you're volunteering as I wrote. It's okay because that's by their choice. So as I write this again, I say no to requiring students of our age and skill to do community service.       In conclusion, I think you should make all students do community service for our town. It will help many others in our town that need help. It will help teach students responsibility. Also, it will get students involved in what is happening around them. Therefore I think that you should make community service mandatory for all students in our school.  I am aware that you may take the action of making community service a requirement to all students. This action is inevitably going to cause controversy among students  I believe that community service is extremely important and that all students should be required to perform some community service.  In my opinion i think that all students shouldn't have to participate in community service ",

So i believe that it was not created by aliens but that it was just something the olanet had made itself. This has certainly got the attention of the people.  The \"Face on Mars\" is not a face. If you look at the pictures from 1976, and 1998, and 2001 and in the text it says that the photo from 2001 is the most recent photo that NASA has. It still looks nothing like a face so since the 2001 picture is the most recent it shows that it is just a natural landform. It is just a natural landform. On Mars there are natural landforms everywhere and the fade away. Here on earth natural landforms are created everyday.  It does look like it could be from another living organism, but it's just a rock on the planet. In our newest image of the rock, it turns out that the face has dissapered. There is no evidence of this being created by aliens, rather it was created by wind and water that has been found on Mars. The reason you might believe that this was indeed aliens, might be the fact that the news has blown it out of poportion. It's just the rock that had some interesting shadows and holes that made it look like a human face.  There you have it. The Face sadly wasn't built by aliens, it was just a natural landform that happened to have some pretty neat features to it due to shadows. There is no way around it, because the pictures don't lie. It is even more obvious that it is a landform because ones just like it exist on Earth! Even though it would've been very interesting for it to have been actually created by aliens, it was just a natural landform in the end.  In conclusion, the face is just a natural landform. It may look like a head, but that is just because of the unusual shadows that the mesa has. If my co-workers and I thought this was actually proof of alien life, why would we hide it from you? What is the point in hiding that kind of information?  Even thoug hmy colleague still believes in the \"Face on Mars\" to be a alien made structure. I still believe it's only a butte or mesa. With my evindence of the \"Face on Mars\" only looking like a face due to the techonology of the time, the shadows of the sun, the angle the picture was taken, and our ability to see faces when none are there, I believe I have conclusive evidence that the \"Face on Mars is nothing but a butte or mesa.  Aliens never made the Face of Mars and the Face of Mars isn't real at all! It's just a natural landform by having the shadows covering up most of the landform making it appear as a face. For the conclusion, Cydonia has a natural landform on it that appears itself as a face using the shadows to make the illusion.  People are facinated with the Man on the Moon and the idea of Martians, but most people do not think about life on Venus. Venus is the second planet from the sun and shares many geographical features with Earth. However, studying this planet is made difficult by the dense and toxic atmosphere, high temperatures, and violent weather. Despite this, some people think that Venus should still be explored, and the author of \"The Challenge of Exploring Venus\" is of this opinion.  Do you believe in aliens? An abundance of people in America think there are others among us from other planets and galaxies. They believe this for a variety of reasons, such as UFO sightings or because of the so-called \"Face\" in Cydonia on the Red Planet Mars. Throughout the years since 1976 we have worked at NASA to discover the secrets of the face, uncovering that it is indeed just a landform with suspicious shadows.  I'm a scientist at NASA and the Face, a lot of people seem to think was formed by aliens or is proof of alien life forms, is actually just a natural landform  The author states that scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa when the face appeared. This shows that they have seen things like this before and they knew that it wasn't real, or alien like. Another example that the author proves is that Garvin said it reminded him of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. The camera on board MGS had to peer through wispy clouds to see the face and perhaps alien markings were hidden by haze. Also NASA can be hidding information about the Face. But, you can see that the Face is formed by shadows, and not an alien haze. ",

                "content": "Going out of your comfort zone can really help you feel better about yourself, and not just keeping to yourself. Some Evidence for this is that, in a study taken by the Social Interaction and Communication Association, 60% of students that keep to themselves have lower than average self esteem. This would make sense seeing how if they always keep to themselves, they don't really have anyone to comfort them in their darker times, which this rule could help prevent. More Evidence that highlights this point is when Zachary Andrews, A College student from Colombia, had this to say, \"I honestly never really talked to that many people when I was younger, I didn't really like myself, and didn't think I deserved friends, but when my parents made me join the basketball team, I met and found people that I got along with really well,\". This would show that their is still hope for people that have low self esteem, that just have to have help taking the big step.  A couple examples to do outside would be to pick up trash or tutor someone. If you pick up trash, people might notice and they will stop throwing stuff out of there car window. They also might help pick up trash. If you help someone else they other person will benefit with a better education, that will be needed for a good job later in life, or the kids might be nice to other people since you were nice to them! You might want to do other things that i didn't mention, and that is fine! As long as you make it to were the kids at SCHOOL_NAME do community work, this planet will be looking good in no time!  although I would respect the principal's ultimate decision, I disagree with her statement. Students should not have to be involved in an extracurricular activity. They should be able to choose if they want to participate in an activity. Ultimately, the students choice should be prioritized, because they know their own strengths, and there are a couple reasons to support my claim. The student may not have the money to do so, it may be out of their comfort zone, and lastly they may not have enough time, and forcing them to participate in an activity would bring stress onto their shoulders.   \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  Students should be free to choose whether they do or don't participate in activities outside of the standard school day. If a student's parents require him or her to do a club or sport, however, that is a very different case. Parents have a say in what their child does, and they have every right to decide if the student will participate in any type of organization. Schools do not and should not have the same level of involvement.  Everybody needs to know that our world needs to get better and cleaner. Littering is probably the worst thing out there that you can do. Something needs to change because when you just walk outside of your house there's a piece of trash and you can help by just picking that piece up. If you could get all the students doing community service then those students could inspire other students or even their brothers, sisters or even their own parents. If just one person could help pick up a little trash then imagine what ten or even fifty people could do this world would be better in no time if everybody could just pitch in a little of there time everyday by making the world a little better.  At home with no teacher supervision, students may find themselves easily distracted by electronics and the accessibility\u00a0to get up and do other things in the comfort of their own house. This results it it taking even longer to get through material and presents the risk of students missing out on important information. Moreover, without teacher supervision it may become tempting for the student to cheat on assignments as it is far more easy to get away with and there would be no one present to enact\u00a0consequences. I've heard many student discussing taking online courses for the sole purpose that they know they can find answer keys and other materials to cheat online. In my particular situation, only my midterm and final exam were monitored in a public setting, leaving opportunity for other students to cheat on any test, quiz, or other classwork assignment.  It's a rebellious stage of life when they think they can do whatever pleases them. So naturally if someone tells them that they absolutely must do something, they automatically think no way. If they have an attitude like this it will ruin the experience and they won't get the good feeling people do when you serve others. They might dislike it so much that they don't even do service when they're grown up. They resent people that tell them they have to do something, and then they are ornery towards everyone else afterwards.  but the students should have freedom over what they do. At least, if anything, contact the students' parents and ask them for approval. Don't just force them to, though, because it's not right to force students to participate in any activities that they aren't interested in doing. With this, I believe that the students should have the freedom to choose and not have to participate in any activity if they aren't intrigued.  No matter who you are, you have your lazy moments. You have those moments where you just don't want to do anything, these moments usually happen at the comfort of your own home. Times like this are easily avoided by attending school, the student wakes up in the morning gets ready, walks to their bus stop and off they go to school. A student who has class at home may or may not forget about their class or even worse know they have it and decide not to do it because they are at home. There is no choice in whether you will go to school today or not, most of the time it's a yes, your parents say you have to go to school and that is what you have to do. Online classes can be avoided if the student just does not do it. Students are supervised in school at all times whether its administration during lunch, or by a teacher in class. Who is going to supervise the student at home? if a parent is home they might do it but if there is no parent it's up to the student to make that decision and its usually a I am too tired to do this.   we should really be doing things that can help ourselves and do community service whenever we want. Because if you force someone to do something, we wont like it. ",

                "content": "in a standard educational setting, students are not able to pick and choose what interests them, and this can lead to a lack of motivation during the normal school year.  In conclusion, schools should not allow students to choose whether they would like to participate in extracurricular activities because it can decrease the quality of the clubs, create unhappiness among students, and cause students to be even more busy and leaving students unavailable for other non-school related activities. Giving students the freedom to be able to choose whether they would like to participate lets students have more power. Taking away that power and putting just another thing thats forced on to their plate will cause students even more stress and discomfort.\u00a0  students would be able to pick a subject that they know they are good at rather then them doing something they have no experience with.  Students should be able to choose if they want to do after school. Some students have a lot of homework already that the teachers give out, so most students are spending a sunny day inside doing homework after a long day at school and a long after school\u00a0activity. Many students have stress and are overwhelmed by having too much homework and after school right after that. Most students have enough work that had to be done during school. Why push it so they have to stay longer and do more work than they should. Adding after school\u00a0to the schedule will make more busy parents frustrated because they are the ones who have to pick up their child. The after school schedules does not meet up with the parents schedule and it make everything chaotic and difficult.  Students should be free to choose whether they do or don't participate in activities outside of the standard school day. If a student's parents require him or her to do a club or sport, however, that is a very different case. Parents have a say in what their child does, and they have every right to decide if the student will participate in any type of organization. Schools do not and should not have the same level of involvement.  In education we always have a choice to choose rather we get our education at home or through public and private school but which one is the right choice ? Throughout this essay we will explore the pros and cons on which one is the more beneficial choice. Many kids in life go to public schools since the start of their education life but there are those that choose to get education at home. A child's\u00a0personality also adds on to what the better choice might be for that certain individual. There are a lot of benefits and non-benefits to having a student attend classes from home.  Students are in school receiving teacher-designed projects all year. On a students summer break, they should at least be able to create a project that interest them. Many young kids, between 3-7, try many different sports like; soccer, basketball, dance, gymnastics, baseball, cheer leading, flag football, etc. parents enroll their kids in different things so they can discover their interest young and stick to what does interest them to improve.\u00a0Many high schools have electives to chose from as an extra class for students to find their interest. If teachers picked the elective classes for the students there is a good chance the student would not enjoy the class, destroying the point of an elective. By letting students branch out and selecting things that they enjoy could create an amazing project.  For example, Students in the public education system can only enroll in courses that are offered at their school. This may restrict students from taking classes that they are interested in or limit students from branching out and potentially finding a new passion. However, students taking online classes can choose from a wide variety of classes, that most likely incorporate their interests. The lack of restraint in regards to the courses offered in distance learning is beneficial for students. Not only do student have the freedom to choose what to learn, they also have the freedom to choose when to learn. Having the freedom of choosing when to learn is vital for students with specific needs or disabilities. When students are unable to go to school, learning can continue. This eliminates sick days, weather delays or cancellations, and school holidays. Furthermore, students are able to take courses at their own speed. Rather than the typical every other\u00a0day school schedule, students can master a course in less than a month. The lack of restraint in regards to the courses offered in distance learning and when a student can learn is beneficial for all students.  If students had the ability to come up with their own projects, it gives them an opportunity to select a topic that could be unsafe or not school appropriate. This is especially important for science projects or English assignments. Giving students the power to choose their projects could be risky when it comes to these two subjects. For science projects, students could end up harming themselves with unsafe chemicals or substances because a lack of a rubric and criteria created by the teacher. For English assignments, students might choose controversial topics that are not appropriate for the school environment, but would not know due to a lack of strict guidelines. The possibility of projects being unsafe and inappropriate are not likely if they are designed by teachers.  Due to the fact that we live in America, where we have the choice of choosing what we would like to do, (most of the time), I due believe that students should have the right to choose weather or not they want to participate in community service ",

                "content": "It can read a total of six emotions with some branches coming off of those emotions. The six emotions are stated in the quote,\" Eckman has classified six basic emotions - happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness - and then associated each with characteristic movements of the facial muscles.\" The machine is able to determine whether a student is in distress or not thus telling the teacher to help the student out with the problem that they are facing. The teacher would be able to help the student cope and deal with their emotional sadness or anger and tell them how to deal with it in order to assist them in getting through it. This is not the end though of what this incredible machine can do for a school.  In the third passage of the artice, the author states, \"Eckman has classified six basic emotions-happiness ... and then associated each with charactersitic movements of the facial muscles,\" meaning that the software associated voluntary or involuntary movements of the face with emotions. The problem with this system is that students can change the look of their face quite easily, and can thus convince the computer to produce desired results, making the system disfunctional. There are quite a few reasons children, especially young ones, would want to make the software not work, including tricking the computer into moving from the original learning program into a more desired one and them simply wanting to see the program fail through their abilities.  According to the article \"Making Mona Lisa Smile,\" there is a new technology called the Facial Action Coding System (FACS) that enables computers to identify human emotions. This technology is relatively brand new. It creates a 3-D computer model of all fourty-four major muscles in the face that move like human muscles as well. Then, psychologists have classified six basic emotions that are associated with different movements in the facial mucles. This new technology could result in many benefits in our community as well as all around the world  It is able to distinguish individual expressions such as happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness which humans can find hard to do making it vital to being infused into the use of schools.  Every living thing on planet earth has emotions. These emotions have been used since the beginning of time to express the feelings of the people around you. However, these emotions can be decieving. Someone could say they are happy, when really they are angry or upset. This is where the Facial Action Coding System comes into play. The FACS is a software that detects human emotion by tracking muscles in the face. For example, when you are happy, muscles in your face move up, and when you are sad, they move down, FACS tracks this and calculates your emotions. The creators of this software, Prof. Thomas Huang and Prof. Nicu Sebe are the leading experts of developing better ways for humans and computers to communicate. There are still some questions surrounding the usefulness of FACS, like what could this software actually be used for? One of the ways FACS may be used is in classrooms.  SInce the technology would be able to understand the basic emotions like \"...happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness\" (paragraph 3), this can give a school tons of feedback on how to improve. For example, with negative emotions, a school would be able to improve its cafeteria food quality from knowing what foods are highly unpopular, and as a result save food from wasting. Or during school events, even though the event might be a success knowing how each of the students felt about the event would help with improving it for next year. The addition of this technology would allow a school to be the best the possibly could.   The human body has way more than just six emotions so getting a high accuracy reading on how you are really feeling is out of the question because FACS uses the a process of a 3-D model Dr. Huang states \"The process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D model of the face; all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles.\" This quote explains that it has to use a way of making a model which can sometimes take some time depending on the processing power of the computer not only that but human emotions can change quite quickly and if the pc doesnt make the model fast enough the computer can easly fail at getting and accuarate reading.  The article states that the technology associates each emotion with \"characteristic movements of the facial muscles\" and then uses those movements to calculate the spectrum of emotions based on their facial display. But some people show emotions in various ways, and the technology most likely cannot accomodate for the many different ways people express the same emotion. For example, if a student has a resting face that seems generally happy, the system might confuse this dazed face as a satisfied face and think that the student is happy with their lessons when they are actually confused or not paying attention. In the same way, if a student has a resting face that looks naturally sad, the system may think they are unhappy with their lessons, even if the student feels they are learning a lot. A lot of students also try to hide their emotions, like frusteration or sadness, with a happier look on their face, and even though the article states that the system can detect a \"false smile\", it cannot always be accurate as a person may be good at hiding their emotions and displaying a genuine smile. Therefore, since technology is not always accurate and because human beings are so various in the way they behave, the technology would not be useful in a classroom where it may misread a student's state of mind and lead them in the wrong path of education.  Emotion is in the brain, not the heart. The way the FACS understands emoion is simple. It maps out a 3-D model of the face, looks at the shape and positoin of all the muscles, then it associates the different facial movements with differet emotion. For example, your orbicularis oris (muscles around your mouth) tighten your lips to show when you are angry. It even works when a person it trying to mask emotions. During a fake smile, the zygomatic major stretches the mouth sidways, while in a real smile the zygomatic major lifts the corners of the mouth. These examples can show how science IS able to understand emotoin, probaly better than most humans. Arguments that use that falshood, that science is unable to understand emotion, is completly false.  There's a new kind of technology called Facial Action Coding System, or FACS, which enables computers to identify human emotions. The use of this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is very valuable ",

If we do not learn this earlier in life we won't have the knowledge and care to do it later in life. Teaching this lesson about community service to children could cause a chain reaction. They could teach their friends the lesson, and they could even teach their children in the future.  Some kids look at community service as a bad thing. When you think of community service most people would think of picking up trash. Say a student hated picking up trash but for community service made him pick up trash. He would learn form this to mot litter because there are people that go around and pick up trash and now he know what it is like. Another example is say a student helping out at a nursing-home. this student could of not like to be around old people. now he would be able to see that the elders are not that bad.  In consideration to my previous statement, if we make the activities seem more like a hobby instead of a chore then students will be more willing to join in. Then, maybe, this will cause a domino effect where one student will tell their friends how exciting community service is and this will lead more children to participate. For Ex: When a group of students are going to clean the litter in their neighborhood, they could make this into a sport. Where the kids grab the trash, like bottles or paper, and they throw it into the garbage bag or recycling bin as if they were playing basketball.  Everybody needs to know that our world needs to get better and cleaner. Littering is probably the worst thing out there that you can do. Something needs to change because when you just walk outside of your house there's a piece of trash and you can help by just picking that piece up. If you could get all the students doing community service then those students could inspire other students or even their brothers, sisters or even their own parents. If just one person could help pick up a little trash then imagine what ten or even fifty people could do this world would be better in no time if everybody could just pitch in a little of there time everyday by making the world a little better.  My final example is that a student could have a friend that is having trouble with math and they want to help their friend they do community service and help their friend with whatever he or she would need help with or if they see a park that is full of litter they could help clean it up. Maybe doing that the student could get extra credit to help their grade if they need to push it up a little.  Our school is a very complex school, with different varieties of personalities. Some people may find it relaxing to help others while some may not have the time to do so. Community service such as picking up litter on a busy high way or walking dogs for people who don't have the ability to do so would, in my opinion, builds character. Community service will help many others while making the students stop and realize that when you help people they may be helped in return.  Every time, theirs a student that doesn't care and leave their garbage on the floor. If we open up this program we could make students more responsible to the school. If the students see the hard work some people take to clean the school environment they would appreciate the work they done and might not want to throw their garbage on the floor like they used to. They would see that since now its them that pick up the garbage and not other people they would be more responsible and throw it the garbage can.  These lessons we learn, will hopefully pay off, such as getting reprimanded for doing something bad.  Do you think someone who is extremely bad, for example someone who is always getting in trouble in school for misbehaving, should be allowed to be rewarded?  Well that is not right because he thinks that he can be bad and do anything he wants and still be rewarded in the end.  He is not being taught anything and it isn't fair.  How would you feel if you were a student who did good in school, got good grades, and tried your hardest while some other student did bad and took the easy way out and was rewarded in the same way?  Also if somebody does, for example, cleaning up the beach as a community service project, they will likely miss trash and litter. This would be due to a lack of enthusiasm, and the person did not really contribute to society. So it is a lose-lose situation to be in, the kids complain that it eats up their time and the job does not get done.  For example if you live by a beach, and there is a lot of garbage, and no one helps pick it up, it can kill the poor harmless animals that might think its food. But if you have all the students help by doing community service it will all get cleaned and we can make sure there are no pieces left behind. ",

                "content": "Some people are to lazy to help out . If we teach children to help out now they won't be lazy in the future  The American lifestyle, some might say that it is hardworking and free, others howeveer might say that we are lazy. I have to agree with both, we have many citizens that are very hardworking and strive to do their best and improve themselves and others. Sadly that is not all of out citizens, we have a gigantic amount of people in our contry that are lazy, they do not want to work for anything, and expect everything in life to be given to them without them putting forth any more effors than applying for some things online. If the automobile manufactorers release a car that drives itself, that will just be one more thing that the lazy americans do not have to do. It would be another thing just handed to them that they would not have to work for. These cars are made by the hardworking to make life for the lazy easier. I do not think that this is something that needs to happen or something that should even be considered.  This makes students gain better work ethic and not be lazy when completing a project they know that they don't have motivation for.  There are some students that just don't like the idea of doing extra work when it's not required. It's not necessarily that they're lazy, but they just dont see the importance of going out of their way to do something that they can't see the immediate benefits to. Enforcing the change could arouse\u00a0some anger in a vast majority of students, and possibly parents, but if the students are given an option to not participate in an extracurricular activity, things would most likely run a lot smoother. Most people would call these types of kids, \"average\" due to the fact that they settle for the amount of work given, and typically don't want to exceed expectations. Perhaps making them participate in beneficial activities wouldn't hurt, they just need to be a little more open minded to the idea at hand.  This would probably only happen for a couple of years or sport seasons but after awhile everything would be back to normal and it would be just like anything else in the world and people would begin to grow to the B average rule that the principle has.  If this is true, having a teacher designed project does not change that situation. The reality is that if a student is lazy and doesn't want to learn, they will not learn.  Students, especially younger ones, cannot be trusted to design a project that would be as beneficial as a teacher-designed project. Students often take shortcuts or the easy way out and while sometimes this can be beneficial to the students and their education, it is more often harmful then doing it the right way and teaches them to be lazy. A teacher-designed project on the other hand, would be designed with the thoughts of providing an enriching experience to the student and hopefully making them a more successful and educated person.  However, some may argue that some students will abuse this system so they could stay home because they wish to skip class and be lazy or maybe just want to stay home.  There are many students who can get lazy when they come home from school. Most of the time, I can be one of those students. Usually when I come home after school, I always get the urge to jump on my bed and just watch videos on my phone. When I get on my phone, I can get so invested in it, that I don't even realize I have a lot of homework assignments to do.  Being lazy is just unhealthy for your body and mental health. Most students probably have been in the same situation as me. Although, if those students were to be in a extracurricular activity, they would be more productive. For example, an activity like playing soccer can help someone's brain/and body to be more active. Another example would be participating in any art-related activity, which can help students think more creatively. Doing any extracurricular activity would be way better than to sit down and watch on a device.  No matter who you are, you have your lazy moments. You have those moments where you just don't want to do anything, these moments usually happen at the comfort of your own home. Times like this are easily avoided by attending school, the student wakes up in the morning gets ready, walks to their bus stop and off they go to school.

There is no choice in whether you will go to school today or not, most of the time it's a yes, your parents say you have to go to school and that is what you have to do. Online classes can be avoided if the student just does not do it. Students are supervised in school at all times whether its administration during lunch, or by a teacher in class. Who is going to supervise the student at home? if a parent is home they might do it but if there is no parent it's up to the student to make that decision and its usually a I am too tired to do this.

In source two it states that the electoral college consists of 538 electors and the most amont of elecrtoral votes is 270, in order to pick an president. Also in source two it states that the number of electors we have equals to the amount of members of congress we have. I propose a new system by only letting the American people select our president by votes counted all up by each state, for example if we didn't have have electoral college,\u00a0 then it would be a fair vote because people votes would count the number that adds up with all votes for one candidates that will oppose another candidates and there would be technically no tie it would either ,more or less, but if we still had the electoral college then the vote would not be equally fair becuse if the majority of a state for examlpe\u00a0 chose republican candidate, then that would be vague becuse some people choose democratic and there vote did not really count. but without the electoral collge, than everyones vote counts and each candidates gets vote from every one, not only electoral.  Also, acorrding to the Office of the Federal Register a total of 270 or more electoral votes are needed to elect a president. The total amount of votes consists of 538 electors, meaning there could be a tie in elections. This implys that the system is not fool proof and can have errors. However, if the popular votes were counted more than the electoral votes there would not be any chance of a tie and a president will always be elected.  It has this ability, because to be a tie both canidates have to have 269 votes which is highly unlikly. To have a President chossen majority has to vote one way (270). Now with a \"winner-takes-all\" system that his country, USA, has, there are only so many combinations of states' votes for one party that there would be a tie. Since the beggening of the Electoral College there has only been two ties. The Electoral College does make it easier for there not to be a tie, because more people voting into selected individuals then having them vote makes it easier for less mess ups and faster counting of votes.  because when they vote for a president they are really voting for electors. The elctors can be any citizen so the voters don't know who the electors are. Voters can rarely decide who the electors vote for which puts them at a disadvantage and is an inconvience for the voters. \"Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president\" (source 2).  This is reliterated when The Office of the Federal Register statees, \" Your state's entitled allotment of electors equals the number of members in its Congressional Delegation: one for each member in the House of Representatives plus two for your Senators...(Office of the Federal Register 1). In addition this means that each state will receive an opportunity to have a meaningful vote to the elections because every state has the same kinds of members being awareded to them. Each state will have a different number of members due to the size, but they will all be of equal value to the canidates. To add for support, Posner says, \"No region has enough electoral votes to elect a president\"(Posner 1). With this, all the states understand that their vote is crucial to the election and the canidates. Fortunately, the Electoral College is fair and equal to all the state's voting in the election, sometimes even more than some states know. For example, Posner states, \" Voters in toss up states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign-to really listen tp the competing candidates-knowing that they are going to decide the election\"(Posner 1).\u00a0 Ultimately, the Electoral College is the most fair way to decide and vote for a future president who will be our leader of all the citizens.   The Electoral College is a system that allots a certain amount of electoral votes to each state. Each state is given 2 electoral votes plus another amount of votes which depends on that state's population. The amount of votes ranges from 3 to 55 (source 3). A candidate must recieve 270 out of 538 possible votes. The candidate the electoral votes of a state go to is decided by the majority vote of each individual state. In all states but Maine and Nebraska give a candidate the entirety of their votes if the majority of its citizen votes for them (source 1)  Most people dont really understand what the Electoral College is, or what it is about, so let me just inform you about it a little. The Electoral College is a process that was established in the constitution and it is a strategy that we use to elect out presidents. The citizens vote for the president, but so the the electors in the Electoral College. There are over five hundred members of the Electoral College, and if a canadate wants to win presidency, he/she has to gain 270 of the Electoral College's votes. Each person running has a set of their own electors  The Electoral COllege votes work so that the population of a state directly effects the amount of votes that states recieves. For example, Wyoming only has about 500,000 voters so it only recieves one electoral college vote. Because there is only one vote for wyoming, the 500,000 voters do not have acurate representation in a vote that has a total of 270 electoral votes.  According to Source 2, \"state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors, and... those electors could always defy the will of the people.\" The defenders could be completely indifferent about the voters choices, or situations where swing states are borderline one party or another, and the Electoral College allows a limited selelction of people to make the final decision of millions (Source 1). The ballots that we vote in don't even effect the results of the election. It is as if these elections are trying to illude citizens from the fact that the only votes that contribute to the adoption of a new president are the electoral votes. Why bother letting us vote for a president, if only the defenders get to make the decisions?  By this the number is much smaller since each country is weighed and is worth certain points and decided by electors you choosed to trust to vote for the same president you did. You still are in control just that you choose somebody he/her is not likely to change his or her mind and vote for the exact person you want he or she to vote for. It stated in the article that \"Each candidate running for president in your state has his or her own group of electors. The electors are generally chosen by the candiate's politcal party.\" I say that if the candidate political party chooses the electors then they must be good and the party must be sure the elector won't change his mind out of no where.

                "content": "When receiving advice, the response you get will be different from everyone. This is because everyone views things from a different standpoint. Some people think it's best to keep their not so positive opinions to themselves, while other are going to share everything with you. It's important to have both these kinds of people in your life, because they're both needed in different situations. Let's say, for instance, you get a new shirt that you absolutely love. You probably want to hear from your peers that it looks great on you. Now, let's say you are shopping and find shoes that you aren't too sure about. In this situation, you're probably wanting to hear from your more honest friend, who will truthfully tell you how they look  Children were told sometime in their life that everybody was unique and\u00a0different\u00a0in some sort of way, that there were absolutely no two people that looks the same, much less\u00a0think and act the same. This applies in everyday life from then and getting advice is not the exception. Everybody has different beliefs, experience and ways to do things so it's hard to find one person that exactly understand you to the point of giving you advice perfectly.  You may think that one word is good, but then your friend from a different country might think that that word is horrible! See now no one person is the same so that's why sometimes if you have and opinion on something then maybe you should ask someone else that has a different cultural background from you. One thing that famous politicians do is check with other people with different backgrounds to make sure that they don't offend people when they don't want to. Before you go out and start blabbing on about some other country maybe you should try and talk to the people from that country so then you don't offend them? You as a person will never be the same than anyone else. I personally have friends from other countries that eat dogs but look here, in the USA if someone eats a dog, that is very illegal. That's a perfect example of how people with other backgrounds will differ in opinions. So as you've read, most people that are different from you will widely differ in opinions from you.  When faced with a problem, many people ask for advice. Advice is one of those things that anyone can give, but not all are good at. If you have one friend who always gives good advice, you may gravitate towards them first, rather than someone who may not be as skilled. However, everybody has different experiences, and may be able to relate to your problem more than someone else.  Everybody knows somebody like this in their lives; a homebody, someone who prefers staying home over going out, maybe doesn't have too many friends or has trouble forging bonds and building relationships. You may also call these people recluses, or shut-ins, but either way, you've stumbled across someone who fits this mold. Favorite characters even, like Oscar the Grouch or Angela from The Office, can be used as lovable examples. However, these traits are not always so endearing in a young child.  Different people will have different ideas and options from their perspectives on different kinds of things. It is best to decide whether or not they have the same opinions or ideas, to see if they could bond to make new decisions. Everyone that that person picks from to get advice, could have the same opinions as others or different. Depending on people you trust may have better opinions then those of the people you do not trust. This person might think that the people they do care about or know more, have more ideas to pick from and approve from because they know and trust them most.  Everyone's point of view will be different like that of your 13 year old friend who is your age and knows you very personally or of your 72 year old grandmother. Your friend may know you well but your grandmother has lived longer as has possibly experienced the same things you are currently experiencing. Each has its own benefit and can help add onto your thought process.  Different people that are helpful to seek advice from is someone who is more of an outside opinion because they tell you the truth and dont sugar coat their thoughts. If you seek someone who has a different mindset they will introduce new ways of thinking and different approaches you could take in the situation.  By expressing all your feelings, thoughts, and emotions you are letting someone know how you feel and getting the support you need to move forward confidently. By talking to multiple people exploring new thoughts and mindsets, getting an unbiased opinion, and being able to express and organize your thoughts you are getting set up to make good choices rationally. I personally believe that when someone asks multiple people for advice it and seeking multiple opinions it helps them be able to make smart and rational choices while being confident with their choice and content with their thoughts and emotions.\u00a0  The third and final reason why this could be bad for our society as a whole is simply that people may become less sensitive to reading other peoples emotions.  Some people will feel positively about the topic while others feel negatively. People have their own opinions and their opinions are how they form an answer. For instance, if someone asks someone else for advice on where they should go for dinner, the action relies on the answer that the person gives. If they say that they should go to a certain restaurant, it could be because the person giving advice likes that restaurant. On the other hand, if the person asks multiple people, they will get a variety of answers because everybody has a different opinion. The more people that someone asks, the more answers that they will get. Therefore giving them a plethora of opinions to base their choice off of. ",

The Electoral College is the best way of picking the right president and doing it right. If you pick your president by a popular vote it would only lead to a disaster. In our world we need a method like this one that will guide us to make the right desion and something as imporatant as our President, well we can just pick out of anything we have to do it\u00a0 wise and neat so the right choice is picked  Us citixen's help choose the state's elector when we vote for the President because. When we vote for the candidate were are voting for the candidate's elector.  When people have to much freedom they don't know what to do and do wrong choices so i think choosing a elector is a good thing they have studied the president and have heard countless promises that he has done. I mean he or she most likley will vote for the candiate running for president you did because he or she is a elector he or she gets the people who also voted for the same person as he or she wants.  for example if one state candidate was choosen for republican and they were \"faithless\" as it says in source two, and chose the democratic party it would be very unfortunate for the republicans because than there would be no point of the votes the republican supporters have voted for. It only comes once every four years, this is very important to the american people, on choosing who they want for the future of america.  In doing this you are having a fair vote in the election with everyone who is eligable to vote, voting whomever they please. If you vote for your own president of your choice there will not be any elector deciding for you if they do not like what you have elected. We need to have a say in what we want. I mean if we want someone to be watching over us, and deciding what to do, we want someone who everyine agrees on. Just a few hundred poeoplpe choosing for you is nothing compared to approximatley more than a million people choosing for themselves. In  Source 2 \"The indefensible electorial college : why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong by Bradford Plumer\"  it says that the electors can always defy the will of the people. In my case I believe that no one would want that. I mean, would you want that?  In summation, instead of having an Electoral College, it should an election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens. Popular votes helps the government understand their citizens better. It lets them know what people want from the government, allows them to have the freedom to make a choice of the president, and gives the government a picture of how many people liked a candidate's plan for them. All in all, popular votes would make elections for the president a lot better to understand.       \u00a0        \u00a0     The people voting don't always know what they want in a president they might be undecided and just choose the best looking one  To start with, how can we live in a democracy were the people do not pick their own president but, some representatives we suposadly chose can. If we were alowed to choose our own president then we could at least feel right in what we chose and not what the representatives did.  Change needs to happen and it has to soon. If not, a poor president could be elected and then who knows what bad things could happen? With the popular vote, more people will be heard, and they will better take part in their country's government, leading to a better nation.       \u00a0 ",

This was soon to be known as the \"Face on Mars\".   In 1976, the Viking 1 spacecraft was orbiting the planet of Mars, and it was taking new pictures for all of mankind to see. As it was passing over a strip of Mars called Cydonia, it snapped a picture that would cause an uproar in space exploration. This new picture showed what seemed to be a human face. A few days later NASA reveled these pictures for the world to see; it was an instant hit  In 1988 a Viking 1 took a, slightly disturbing, picture. Of a face! Viking 1 found a landform that happends to look like an Egyptian Pharoah. This face was found and started major controversy.  Some people had thought that it was fake and others thought that it was just a coincidence. The massive sand storms just created a face. That's all that they thought. But can that be true?   When the face on Mars was originally captured, there was no such thing. The article explains that when the picture was originally captured in 1976, the camera quality was not great. For example the text states, \"Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo.\" So, when given a better camera quality than in 1976, the face on mars no longer looks like a defined face. Although the quality of the camera is a great support, there are many other explanations that put an end to conspiracy theorists.  The first picture that was taken of the face on Mars was taken in 1976 and the quality back then was not as good as it is now. The picture that was taken in 2001 was a higher quality picture and scientists figured out that is was just a mesa and not a sign of any ancient civilization on Mars. For example the camera used in 1976, spanned 43 meters compared to the camera NASA used in 2001 spanned 1.56 meters. In the picture of 1976, the shadows that were present that day formed an illusion that made it seem like there was a face. In paragraph two of the article \"Unmasking the Face on Mars\" it says that, \"Scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia, only this one had unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh.\"  n paragraph 10 it says,\" ...43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo.\" This shows that the photo didn't give very compelling evidence that there was life on Mars. soon later NASA and their supporters claimed that this face is just an act of nature is because of the 1998 Global Surveyor spacecraft. This new spaceship passed over the red planet to take pictures of the \"face on Mars\". The pictures were ten times better than the last pictures of Cydonia this time. The new photos clearly showed a landform on Mars and not a man.  In 1976 the face looked like a face. In 1998 it started to not look like a face at all. In 2001 it just looked like a rock. So i believe that it was not created by aliens but that it was just something the olanet had made itself. This has certainly got the attention of the people.  The \"Face on Mars\" is not a face. If you look at the pictures from 1976, and 1998, and 2001 and in the text it says that the photo from 2001 is the most recent photo that NASA has. It still looks nothing like a face so since the 2001 picture is the most recent it shows that it is just a natural landform. It is just a natural landform. On Mars there are natural landforms everywhere and the fade away. Here on earth natural landforms are created everyday.  Both seem to resemble a simple mesa, a natural landform quite common on Mars. The 1998 photograph was slightly blurry, so three years later Michael Malin and his crew returned to the Red Planet, to the Cydonia region. Mr. Malin set the Mars Global Surveyor camera to maximum resolution, and snapped an excellent picture from above the Face. And, going even further, I will point out that each pixel in the 2001 photograph spans1.56 meters, as the Viking I's 1976 photo spans 43 meters per pixel. As you can see, this is a significant difference and must not be overlooked.  In 1976 NASA released a photo of a landform on Mars resembling a human face. Not everyone was easily convinced that it was only just a landmass though. Conspiracy theorists believed that it was, \"Bona fide evidence of life on Mars.\" In the article \"Unmasking the Face on Mars,\" the author, Garvin, believed that it was only a mesa.  The Apollo 11 mission was just seven years old! To attach a high-powered camera to a space shuttle was very challenging at the time. I still hold to my belief that, during the 1976 mission, it was either the fault of the Viking I for holding a bad angle for the camera and causing blurriness, or the camera's fault for simply not being powerful enough. The 1976 photo spans just 43 meters per pixel, which at the time was a very high resolution, but now is considered very low. All in all, the Viking I photo of the Face on Mars is forty years old and must not be taken as seriously as it once was. ",

There are many reasons that the Elctoral College is unfair to the voters of the U.S. State inequality, diaster, ties, and people loosing the urge to vote. The list goes on and on and if this doesn't make you see what is wrong with this system than I don't know what will. I hope you take this information to good use and use it to tear down this unfair system once and for all. If we really want to be a democracy, than we have to do away with this system. Many of Americans believe that this is the best way and several have published interesting papers on that topic that may chaneg the minds of people who are still for it.

These are the reasons that I do not think driverless cars should be pursued by car companies. I do agree that they would be very cool, but they are in fact, to good to be true. With the many complications that could come up, to the lack of freedom in teens, driverless cars take away more than what they could be bringing. Instead of investing in this innovation, we should use the investments to pursue more practical products, and to continue to make what we already have, better. Driving comes with a great responsibility that technology does not have. That is why I do not think driverless cars are a good idea for the safety of our generations.

You get to do something you enjoy, you get to meet new people, you'll be happier, and although people may find ways to argue against the new requirements, the good outweighs the bad. There are plenty of options at most schools so that everyone can find something that they enjoy. There are plenty of different sports, there are debate clubs, the student council, yearbook committee, the school newspaper, theatre, and clubs for almost any interest someone may have. In conclusion, I agree fully with the principal's new decision and I believe that everyone should participate in some type of extracurricular as well.  I'm sure most students would agree that teachers really know how to put you to work, while that sounds like a bad thing, it's actually very helpful. Teachers know how to drill information into a student's brain. However, I do understand why students would want to be in charge of organizing summer projects. Students want projects to be fun and easy, usually with as little work as possible, as to where teachers would more than likely want as much work as possible  I do not think that online learning would be beneficial towards students  I firmly believe that making extracurricular activities compulsory for students is not a good idea. Those activities are meant to be optional, and if every student were to do them schools would have to monopolize everybody's personal time by extending the school day, drain the little instructional time teachers have by shortening their classes, or elongate the entire school year. While at first it may seem like a terrific idea, various cracks start to reveal themselves at second glance. In the end, I don't think the idea would have worked.   \u00a0  I do believe there should be an option to take some classes online, but one should not receive their whole education through technology. There needs to be hands-on activities present for students to participate in because thats where they can gain life-lasting skills. ",

Less car usage will help the enviroment as well as lower stress. \"Transportation is the second largest source of America's emmisons.\" (Source 4). By eliminating uneeded car usage and introducing more public transportation and alternate means of transport we will be eliminating one of the greatest causes of greenhouse gas emissions in America. The advantages of eliminating car usage is less pollution, healthier living and a less stressful life.  a life without cars might be a life worth living since it contributes to a stress-free society, a healthy environment, and an acceptance of other means of transportation. By relying less on cars, people can eliminate the variety of negative impacts on the world. The Earth can become a happier, cleaner, and more accepting place with a dead engine.     Although cars seem like a material object that is so precious to life, it's not. In all reality people can live a life without cars, citizens in Bogota, Paris, and Germany have, and they enjoy it. Its time to make a switch and make a helpful change in your lifestyle. A life without cars is very benefitial, it is less stressful, lowers pollution, and has an increases of money. Although not using cars is a bit extreme, you can always make a better switch to using electric products, which can also help lower the amount of toxic gases in the air. Gas car's that produce extreme levels of gases are a thing of the past, I believe its time to move to the future.       \u00a0     This complied understanding from different ideals, new people and diverse people will give you a great advantage when seeking advice. Once you have this information you must find the advice that best applies to you and you situation. Taking to bias into account make the decision, whether it is life business opportunity or a new brand of dog food, being thorough with advice will always benefit you. Once you have your new advice you have gained more than just an idea on what to do, you have also gained new understanding of the people you have asked and a lot of information that will make a smarter person.  It helps stop waste and pollution. It is safer for the world and its people. Without pollution the world and humans can go on living healthy lives and lifestyles. Not taking care of the world is not taking care of ourselves. The world could end as we know it because of pollution. It isn't safe.  By improving public transport we reduce car usage which improves the enviroment and quality of life.   By choosing to not take a traditional school, an individual is able to focus more than just their academic life and able to take on more opportunites that most likely would not be given if it were not for this barrier. Also, attending classes online pushes a person on being more independent because it is ultimately all on them to juggle with their own academic and personal life. Although attending classes online might not be for everyone, it goes to show that there are many benefits one can take from it.  An advantage to reducing car usage is a more benifical enviroment and a better overall health standard.  Life with out cars benefits the environment, and peoples' health. ",

Therefore; This \"so called face\" is not a face, but it is just a land mark that was naturally constructed by the elements and not alien life-forms.  In 1976 the face looked like a face. In 1998 it started to not look like a face at all. In 2001 it just looked like a rock. So i believe that it was not created by aliens but that it was just something the olanet had made itself. This has certainly got the attention of the people.  The \"Face on Mars\" is not a face. If you look at the pictures from 1976, and 1998, and 2001 and in the text it says that the photo from 2001 is the most recent photo that NASA has. It still looks nothing like a face so since the 2001 picture is the most recent it shows that it is just a natural landform. It is just a natural landform. On Mars there are natural landforms everywhere and the fade away. Here on earth natural landforms are created everyday.  The \"face\" isn't any perticular shape that any man or alien would want. The landform would be shaped as a circle, square or any other simple shape, and it would not be so ridgid and cracked. If you were to look at the photo furthest to the left, you would assume that it resembled a face, but If you compair that photo to the one taken twenty-five years later, you would begin to understand that to photo was out-dated and that the camera was not as clear as the one taken later. In addition, why would an alien make a structure of a human's face.   NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft has found something while circling  Mars. But what is it, they have seem to have found a face formed into the rocks. Is this new discovery actually a face or is it just another rock formation.  The believers and the non-believers of the face on Mars are waiting anxiously to find out what it is. Is it a rock formation or is it an actual human face, no one knows  So in conclusion it is not a alien made face it simply in a mesa or a landmark on Mars. The proof is in the article when you see the 3 picutes that were taken to prove it wasn't a alien made artifact. No matter how cool it would be if it was not to mention that it could make NASA famous or rich it just doesn't have the proof you need to be a alien artifact. If you look more into the passage it even says it was not a alien made artiffact. Yes this face was very famous it even says \"The \"Face\" on Mars has since been a pop icon. It has starred in a Hollywood film, apperered in books, magazines, and even radio shows.\" (5). See how famous that face was 25 years ago is amazing but it still doesn't mean it was a alien made artiffact. So in final say it is not a alien made face and nor will there be enough proof its just a landmark on Mars that was very popular to people everywhere!            In conclusion, the face is just a natural landform. It may look like a head, but that is just because of the unusual shadows that the mesa has. If my co-workers and I thought this was actually proof of alien life, why would we hide it from you? What is the point in hiding that kind of information?  It does look like it could be from another living organism, but it's just a rock on the planet. In our newest image of the rock, it turns out that the face has dissapered. There is no evidence of this being created by aliens, rather it was created by wind and water that has been found on Mars. The reason you might believe that this was indeed aliens, might be the fact that the news has blown it out of poportion. It's just the rock that had some interesting shadows and holes that made it look like a human face.  people had many reasons to believe what they believed. Michael Malin had to find out the answer and find out what exaclty made it. That's exaclty what he did. He found out it was just a landform that resembled a face.  They may lie about not doing their homework or be untruthful about whether they were involved in a fight. The FACS machine could solve that issue as it is able to determine whether someone is lying or not based on their expression which is stated in the quote,\" To an expert, faces don't lie; these muscle clues are sometimes used to spot when a \"smiling\" politician or celebrity isn't being truthful.\" This machine is able to examine the details of one's face to find out if they are lying or not. It examines the key traits of each specific emotion and if they are not meant, that is how it knows whther the truth has been told or not. Students will no longer bee able to weasel their way out of punishment due to their superior lying skills as the FACS machine is able to see through the lies. This is not the only thing this machine can do though for schools.  Three years later we recieved the best results possible. the photo not only showed no carvings but it also showed that there was no face at all! ",

                "content": "While providing simple, yet interesting facts about Venus, such as it being the planet closest to Earth's density and size, may be enough to intrigue the audience into wanting to learn more about the planet, the author takes it a step further. The author goes in depth about the possibility of Venus being the most Earth-like planet in our solar system long ago. They detail the planet's environment today, consisting of Earth-like structures such as rocky sediment surfaces, valleys, mountans, craters, and other geological findings. They also state \"Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth.\" This information opens up an entirely new realm of possibilites for the audience to consider, and is more likely to interest them as it directly relates to our life on Earth. The way the author has set up the comparisons of Earth and Venus have allowed the audience to view the exploration of the planet as an opportunity to see a planet that could be like us; a planet with living, breathing forms of life similar to what we see everyday. The author uses this information to encourage the audience to view the pursuit of Venus as a chance to gain information on the things we see in our everyday life, and not just complex ideas that are difficult to understand and most-likely won't affect them.  The author went off topic throughout the article. The different information created slight confusion as to what the message he was trying to convey  The author does a good job by using details to support that although this is a challenge, they are willing to dive deeper into studying this \"Evening Star\" known as Venus.  The author supports their claim by giving numerous details and supporting his ideas.\"Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endbeavors.\" A big issue that is brought up are the harsh conditions Venus brings. \"On the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Farenheight, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet.\" Knowing this, you might think that they must stop there with their research because there's no way they can discover Venus now because it's to dangerous and harsh. That is false, \"NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray.\" Their solution is to have a vehicle hovering over Venus that would avoid the unfriendly ground conditions by staying up and out of their way. It would still be toasty but not deathly. The author claims, \" Not easy conditions, but survivable for humans.\" The author supports his claim by saying yes, the temperature is a challenge they will face, but NASA has one particular compelling idea for sending humans to study Venus, and they will continue to challenge themselves and find solutions to these conflicts they face.  Lastly, the author supports their idea by telling us how we are going to uncover more information without loosing more.  From the very first descriptions of the idea the author is trying to bring across, the audience is turned away from the author's opinion. The tone set sways the audience toward one direction of the conflict while the author is in the other direction. The author went too far into detail about the dangers that can come from studying Venus and di not have evidence of how it would be safe and possible at all. The author's idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers was not supported through their ideas or evidence.          Given these details, he uses useful information that we need to know. In the first paragraph he describes what Venus actually is. If he wasn't to do that, people might be misleaded and still assume that Venus could perhaps be a star. The author gives very useful information to describe what Venus is.  In conclusion, the author supports the exploration of Venus, and is open to finding ways to explore this harsh planet. He believes that the knowledge we would gain from Venus would be very beneficial to the people. He believes that mankind has endured many other harsh endeavors such as the exploration of Venus, and the curosity of mankind will likely lead us to exploring the great hot planet of Venus.  Each person comes from a different background, they all have their own knowledge and ideas. Consulting different people will lead to tons of information on whether you are making the best choice. One example is that publishers make authors send their books to professional editors, editors advise the authors to add some of their ideas and fix any mistakes that are shown. This goes to show that having another person that will give helpful bits of information will help make a much better decision.   Authors that present a well-developed, convincing argument can have a large influence on their reader's thoughts. In the passage, \"The Challenge of Exploring Venus,\" the author explains the different reasons as to why Earth, as a whole, should further study the planet of Venus, alotting all its difficulties.

                "content": "Furthermore, the Electoral College system is flawed...there are millions of people in America and yet only 538 votes are counted  It is still possible to have a tie though because there are 538 total votes and since that is an even number then it can happen. And if there is just a stlight difference and instead the electoral college creates a landslide then that isn't representing the actuall number of the votes by the people. Once again you are being cheated out of your sya it the election. The hardest thing to understand is why people would still support something that doesn't support them. The electoral college basically throws away your votes and replaces them with theirs. And once again, it is possible for ties in the electoral college due to the even number of votes.  The popular vote is a clear statement of voters' opinions and is virtually unable to be tampered with. On the other hand, the Electoral College only complicates the situation by introducing a middle man who is prone to bribery and mistakes. Why should we allow candidates to win because of the electoral vote if they do not recieve the overall approval of the public? Compare the opinions of 538 electors to the opinions of hundreds of millions of voters. Evidently, the opinions of all these voters cannot be properly represented by these 538 electors. It's just impossible both logistically and logically.  if one occured, the election would be disrupted by the unorderly process of which we would have to take to decide the president. In 1968, a change of votes from just 41,971 people would have tied the electoral votes due to the even number of 538 Electors.  Also, acorrding to the Office of the Federal Register a total of 270 or more electoral votes are needed to elect a president. The total amount of votes consists of 538 electors, meaning there could be a tie in elections. This implys that the system is not fool proof and can have errors. However, if the popular votes were counted more than the electoral votes there would not be any chance of a tie and a president will always be elected.  If the vote were solely based on citizen votes, the statisitcal outcome of the event would be crazy. With the majority of the electoral college applying the winner take all approach, it cuts those numbers down incredibly. It is allot easier to confirm a winner out of 538 votes then it is\u00a0 to confirm one out of hundreds of millions of votes now isn,t it?   While the electoral college, in total, has only a couple hundred votes, it is less rational than the millions upon millions of people across the nation wanting to vote for whoever they wish with the use of the popular vote method. In '  The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong', the author explains, in paragraphs 4 and 5, how in the case of a tie in the electoral vote, that \"the Houses selection can hardly be expected to reflect the will of the people.\" Meaning that no matter what the people think, the president shall be chosen for them. And this is not the right way to elect the person designated to run the country  The first example appears in the method of the \"...\"winner-take-all\" system that awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate\"(Office of Federal Register 7). Because of this system, Presidential candidates may not feel the need to campaign to all people, just those of the states with the highest amount of electoral votes(Plumer 13). This goes against the american concept of \"all men are created equal\", leaving voters feeling undervauled and not important. Second, \"A tie in the nationwide electoral vote is possible because the total number of votes-538- is an even number..\" (Posner 18). Although this tie is claimed to be \"highly unlikely\". However, an election by popular vote would make the conundrum even further unlikely by the general logic of the fact that it is a lot less possible for the opinion of an entire nation to be split down the middle than that of 538 electors.  \"Perhaps most worrying is the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote,\" says source 2. A tie in the votes, which is very much possible since the total number of votes is 538, according to source 1, could then allow the fate of America to rest in the hands of the House of Representatives, a miniscule representation of the people.  According to source 3, paragraph 18, Richard A. Posner claims that, \"A tie in the nationwide electoral vote is possible because the total number of votes-538- is an even number, but it is highly unlikley...\" There's a shockingly short ammount of votes required to turn an election into a situtation where both canidates have an even number of votes, a problem almost occured in 1976, that were if, according to source #2, paragraph #12, Bradford Plumer, \"a mere 5,559 voters in Ohio and 3687 voters in Hawaii had voted the other way.\" Those may look as if they are big numbers, however in comparison to the amount of voters in each state, these are not large amounts of people who needed to vote the other way. In comparison, the number of representatives is determined by the number of members in your congressional delegation, the amount of electors per state is fair. Still, however, the event of a tie would cause a lot of issues within our country, and would be relieved if the winner was elected by popular vote.  ",

                "content": "Cell phones today are generally used for many reasons. They may be used for texting, calling, emergencies, and many more reasons. Shocking but true, in this day in time, people need cell phones. Some may be against this matter, but do they know everything besides teens texting everywhere they go? Cell phones are one of the major ways of communicating.  All cell phone users can vouch that having a cell phone comes with understanding that there are a plethora of different applications going on within that minuscule device. Loud notifications from social media sites and vibrating text messages from friends and family, even though they may seem important, are all distractions that come with having a device. When someone is distracted, their reaction time when operating the vehicle becomes impaired which poses a threat to everyone on the road, even if they are just a passenger. If cell phone usage is banned from drivers, it would not be the first time or first \"place\" that cell phone usage has been barred from. Cell phone usage has been restricted or banned from vital places such as school and the workforce. This is all for the reason that it can alter that particular person's effectiveness when trying to conduct or produce work. If cell phones are not allowed in these places because they distract people so greatly, why should they be allowed when someone is operating a car that weighs a few tons?  As of 2017, an estimated 270 million people have a cell phone in the United States. Cell phones have been an everyday object that is addictive and is used for the majority of a day. In particular, cell phones are commonly used while driving, even though it sounds dangerous.  Our society's reliance on technology has increased significantly in the past few decades.  Mobile phones were once brick-like impractical devices. Since then, they have evolved into sleek mini computers. Now that phones are more portable, people tend to take their cell with them everywhere, including on the road. With the heavy reliance our society has created around these devices, it is, understandably, difficult to resist using them. For this very reason, cell phones pose a great risk to driver's. The distraction imposed by smartphones can be just as harmful as driving under the influence.  First and foremost, cell phones are a major way of communicating. Students may need to communicate with parents, siblings, and other students.  Today, many humans own and operate cell phones on a daily basis. The introduction of the modern-day cell phone has made life easier. The cell phone has improved communication between individuals despite the distance. Cell phones have also made receiving information easier for the user when lacking understanding on a certain subject. In other words, the invention has made life more convenient, which resulted in dependence on the object. However, there must be a limitation to the usage of the object, especially when using the cell phone at that time can be life threatening. One of the many times that a cell phone should not be operated is while driving.  Technology is everywhere these days. In our pockets, on our tables and counters, everywhere we turn. You're using technology right now, as you read this. One of the most important types of technology we have is our cell phones. Everyone from 10-year-olds to 100-year-olds have them. To some people, it's just to connect with friends, to others, it's what their whole career depends on it. Either way, cell phones are a key element in today's society.  Teenagers, out of everyone, are typically the age group that most depends on their cell phones. Whether it's just for talking to friends, communicating with their boss, or speaking with their family, there's no denying it. Teenagers love their cell phones.  There is no doubt that cell phones are very important to our every day lives. They allow people to get in contact with each other in just the click of a button. But they can also cause problems, not just at home, but in school too.  According to a study conducted in 1995, only 13 percent of the United States population owned cell phones. This statistic goes to prove that before cell phones became widely popular; people were able to operate vehicles without it. Some may argue that phones provide GPS services that assist in getting drivers to their destination,which by all accounts is true. However, phones aren't the only devices that provide GPS services. There are actual GPS devices that prove way more accurate than cell phone applications. Also, these GPS devices pose way less of a threat when it comes to distracting drivers as they are strictly meant for giving directions instead of having multiple purposes. If drivers have some kind of emergency such as a death or injury in the family, drivers can pull into a parking lot or pull over on the side of the road in order to communicate with whomever they need to communicate with. There is no acceptable reason as to why one should be using their cell phone while operating a vehicle.  Cellular devices are a distraction from school work and assignments they keep a student occupied with social activities and interaction rather then the grades and assignments that the student has been assigned. Also a cell phone is not only a distraction for students but a hazard. Imagine if you will how hard it is carrying all your books and other school related items without distraction then amagin your cell phone going off in your pocket, of course you answer it but while pulling the phone from your pocket you trip and fall. it is much easer to fall and drop books or food while talking on a cell phone.

                "content": "As you know, it is important to keep the best desicions of your country in mind , while thinking about your citizens that you are representing. The electoral college answers the questions of having disputes and arguments over who becomes preseident. It is an efficient way of keeping a fool-proof outcome and avoid run-off elections.  The Electoral College is a process put into place by the founding fathers for the purpose of electing a president. However, this process was enacted at the very beginning of the United States and the question must be asked, Is it still neccessary? Or even fair?  In conclusion, the electoral college is ineffective and outdated. we should no longer use this as a system of defining our president. Even though a winner is often more clear, there is still a possibility of a tie between candidates. People who support the Electoral College also argue that its a good thing due to swing states having more attention payed to them and therefore being more careful in their decision. However, this reasoning is flawed in that it assumes that citizens of a state are more likely to inform theirselves thouroughly simply because their vote holds more value, in a sense. Also, candidates would no longer pay special attention to swing states if the electoral college weren't in place so the votes of these citizens wouldn't be held above the rest. Increased value of votes is not a good thing, which this argument also assume. It is the best decision to abolish the Electoral College.    He elaborates further to say that \"Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the presidet, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president. This proves my point further, because once again we do not vote for our president, we vote for the people who get the \"priveledge\" to vote for the most prestine place of power in our entire country.  This process by which the president is elected is unfair to those of us who are old enough to vote and understand politics  While many may argue for it, the Electoral College has proved to be an obselete way of electing the President.  Also, acorrding to the Office of the Federal Register a total of 270 or more electoral votes are needed to elect a president. The total amount of votes consists of 538 electors, meaning there could be a tie in elections. This implys that the system is not fool proof and can have errors. However, if the popular votes were counted more than the electoral votes there would not be any chance of a tie and a president will always be elected.  In conclusion, the Electoral College seems unconstitutional, since a variety of issues can occur due to the many problems that could potentially occur. The United States should shift into a more reasonable and logical means of electing our president in our Republic, where everybody is equal. The Electoral College should no longer decide the president based on the possibility of a tie, the possibility for betrayal of trust and disputes due to how close the votes are. The system should change to where the popular opinion should\u00a0 decide on the president of the United States of America, making people believe that their vote will be fairly counted.  But in the event that the elector is chosen and does not vote for whom he or she was elected by the people to vote for. What happens then? The wrong president is chosen because there was a fault in the system.  In a situation like this, it doesn't even matter what the popular vote results are becasue the College still gets their unique say in the presidency. However, if we got rid of the Electoral College it wouldn't matter if there was a tie in the popular votes because it could just be disputed in Congress, the same way it would be handled if there were to be a tie in the current Electoral College ",

                "content": "As stated in the text, the conditons on the planet are \"far more extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth.\" Even with advanced technology that we have today, the article states that \"no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours.\" If the technology we have today can't even survive the conditions on Venus, how are humans supposed to be able to? Even though the author claims the conditions are \"not easy, but survivable for humans,\" the temperature can climb up to over 800 degrees Fahrenheit. These pieces of evidence from the excerpt convey the idea that Venus and its characteristics are far too dangerous for humans to even go near.  \"A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus. Even more challenging are the coulds of higly corrosive sufuric acid in Venus's atmosphere.\" In Paragraph 3, the author does not give a higly convincing argument. Humans need oxygen to live, so how is it expected for them to survive on a planet that has little to no oxygen? It is not possible to change the chemical makeup of an entire planet. The argument displayed by the author is not credible in any way and does not give any reason as to why one would want to continure research in this area.  n paragraph 10 it says,\" ...43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo.\" This shows that the photo didn't give very compelling evidence that there was life on Mars. soon later NASA and their supporters claimed that this face is just an act of nature is because of the 1998 Global Surveyor spacecraft. This new spaceship passed over the red planet to take pictures of the \"face on Mars\". The pictures were ten times better than the last pictures of Cydonia this time. The new photos clearly showed a landform on Mars and not a man.  The article says, \u00a8... humans have sent numerous spacecraft to land on this cloud-draped world,\u00a8 and then says \u00a8... since no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours.\u00a8 If a spacecraft made by people can not survive the landing on Venus numerous times, how can we even come close to surviving the trip? Venus is too dangerous to explore and it is a waste to even send a spacecraft. The spacecrafts cost a good amount of money to make and for them to be wasted on a inhospitable planet is not worth the information we would achieve.   This way the scientists will not have to experience the total wrath of Venus's surface, but they would experince \"temperatures that would still be toasty at around 170 degrees Fahrenheit, [and] the air pressure would be close to that of sea level on Earth.\" Humans can live in those conditions, even though they may not be ideal. Scientists would be able to explore Venus without putting them at risk. There is still not technology for the scientists to throughly explore Venus the way they want to. They would only get a glimpse into what Venus is like. New inivations are being worked on that can withstand Venus's tumultous surface, so that scientists can get the full picture of  Venus.  With very high resolutioned photos, it is hard for conspiracy theorists to still say that there is face on Mars. It even says in paragraph 11,\" So if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!\"  For example, \"At thirty-plus miles above the surface, temperatures would still be toasty at around 170 degrees Farenheit, but the air pressure would be close to that of sea level on Earth\" (5). The author uses this piece of evidence to demonstrate that Venus's conditions are possible for humans to survive, making Venus a serious contendor for space exploration.  When talking about something as dangerous as exploring another planet, it is easy to see that our Earth bound technology simply cannot do the job. in paragraph 5 of the article, the author describes an idea that was thought up by \"The National Aeronautics and Space Administartion\". This idea is to have humans 30 or so miles above Venus for exploration. The author claims how this would be beneficial in keeping humans safe from the Venusian landscape. However, The author does not support this idea well, as he goes on to say how not much exploration can be done from there, and the conditions would still be extremely dangerous but \"survivable\". Also in paragraph 7, the author explains how NASA is working on other approaches to study Venus. He explains how they are working on some simplified electronics, made of silicon carbide, that have been testedd in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface. This may sound like a good thing, but it is far from one. This is because the author finsihes by saying that the electronics lasted only three weeks. If a computer can't withstand Venus's conditions longer than three weeks, I am very doubtful that a human can. This proves my point that our technology is far too inadvanced for such a task like exploring another planet. Therefore supporting my claim that the author did a poor job in supporting this idea.  The author mentions that no spacecraft has survived on Venus: \"...no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours\" (The Challenge 2). Since these missions have been unmanned, there is not much loss except for the spacecraft itself, but if there had been a human aboard, the loss would be tremendous and nothing would be gained from the mission. The conditions of Venus simply will not allow manned missions for closer examination of the planet.  The two oppsing sides in this argument have evidence to argue their opinion. The belief that the mesa is actually a face is inncorect due to evidence in the article and my essay. Mesa's are common in the area the picture was taken and the face was caused by shadows along with a low quality camera. Whichever side you are on I believe I have brought forth enough evidence to change your opinion or strengthen your opionion that there was no alien lifeforms yet found on Mars. ",

                "content": "Our country prides itself on being \"the land of the free, and the home of the brave,\" yet our people are being discouraged at every turn by our government. The popular opinion of our people is that the government is out to get us, and there's not much evidence to contradict that. The electoral college system allows for the government to be run by men who didn't fairly win over our country, and isn't accurately representing our views. It's rife with corruption, and allows money to buy power. If we remove this system in favor of a popular vote election would encourage more popular policy, make our government closer to the people, and have little to no negative impact on our country.     Eeveryone should have a say in what goes on where ever it is that they live. We the people make up the government. Who draws the line that states whether or not you are allowed to vote. We do! Therefore we should be able to decied ourselves who can be our president to the United States of America. It is niot fair that we need to elect others to have our submission be made. Even when we tell our electors who we choose, they might turn arouhd and vote for the other person. In  Source 2 \"The indefensible electorial college : why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong by Bradford Plumer\"  backs up my response when stating,\"In the same vein, 'faithless' electors have ocasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please...\". That to me my friend, is not fair at all.  They have much more power than the standard voter. The electors would completly oppose the most \"popular\" vote and put in their vote for whoever they feel deserves it. This is wrong and totally goes against the idea of giving the people power. This would qualify as just giving a few people power. There could also be room for a tie. This could result in the elcetion ending in the hands of the House of Representatives where the state delegates could chose the president. Not only is this destorying the power of the general public but this could also result in people not getting what they wanted. The delegates cuold go completly against what the people say because they technially have the right to since they have the power of the situation.  By , not making their vote count some people can feel that their voices are not being heard which can lead to in some cases riots and rebellions etc. Voting happens for a reason if gives the world a chance to pick whom they want to see lead them and who they feel like is the right person but in the end if there votes cant count and actually go to the electors limits their power and freedom to speak. '' Voters in presidential elections ae people who want to express a political prefeence rather than people ho think that a single vote may decide an election''.(source 3 , p.23). The Electoral College may have worked in the past but now its not working as well.  Sometimes the electoral candinates vote against the people that elected for them and go for what they think is right which in no case is incorrect but a hudreds of citizens were counting on them to make their choice. We all have a voice, we have to use it in the fair way, and the righthous way is mostly a popular vote  The outdated, unfair system just hurts the U.S. government and the country as a whole, it does not benefit our government or citizens in anyway what so ever. Under the electoral college system voters are voting for a slate of electors who don't always vote for their own party candidate rather than voting for the candidate they want to govern our country. 60% of voters would prefer direct election and popular vote anyway so why not throw out the old worn down process that dosent work and replace it with something the people of this country actually want, popular vote.  Politicts have been around for centuries; politics were made to keep the peace and give everyone a fair expresion to the people. We have all herd of people in political standpoint have been corrupt, but what if our own voting system was corrupt and our votes have never made a diffrence in selecting a president by the people. When we vote for our selected president is it really going to change or make a diffence on who gets elected... right? \"of course it will make a diffrence.\" As long as your states electors dont choice by who they feel is the best fit for presidency. On another note what about the Electoral college votes. Why does one canidate always get all the electoral college votes from one state? Why cant we just revert to how many votes the canidate gets?  humans aren't the most honest things on Earth. Also, there is the feeling of being important that you get when you think that you could tip the scale, it makes you feel special, and in control of your own country. What's the point of voting if there's a chance it might not matter, because the other party just won California, the state with the most amount of points, 55, and you couldn't do anything because you live in Idaho or North Dakota, with only three little points. Popular vote would make you feel involved, and happy to help.  They can lie, cheat, they go behind the backs of the states citizens and not\u00a0 even vote for who the citizens want. In 1960, segregationists in the lousiana legislature tried to get rid of the democratic electors. They wanted to replace them with people who would oppose John F Kennedy. Sourse 2, number 11 says \"In some vein, faithless electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for whoever they please...\" This means that with an Electoral college, the person you want to vote for may not even get picked cause of lying electors.  The Elecoral College uses a group of people from each state, numbers varying from each, to represent voters in an election. The voters mark down a candidate on a ballot. However, they are actually voting for a group of strangers to represent them. Many voters do not even realize that this is the case. In politics, there are many powerful and influential people who will go to drastic measures to ensure that their ideas somehow make it to power. Bribes and insentives could easily be given to electors in attempts to sway their vote. Speaking of, these electors can be anyone who are not in a public office position, emphasis on the anyone. Voters can never really be sure that they can trust those strangers who they did not even get to select. Once the votes have been counted, voters cannot fully control who the elctors actually vote for. There have been instances where electors have attempted to completely avert the votes cast and choose a different candidate that they want in office. ",

                "content": "They get homework from multiple classes, participate in sports or music classes, and they hangout with their friends and have fun being a teenager. Making students be forced to stay after school would not work for students who play sports and have practice, or students who have to help support their families with a job. Having them be forced to do an activity would take away time from other things that they need to do, or things that they want to do.  When I brought up going to chess club earlier I thought that I would dread it but it turned out to be super fun. I also met some of my best friends that I still talk to today, they were super inviting and had a passion for the game and enjoyed it. I had never seen anyone enjoy a game that much. When thinking about it, it seems like a very funny and interesting story how you met your friends but when I talk to some kids they tell me that they met their best friends\u00a0of today by simply sharing the same interests and that is a great way to make friends. When going to a certain activity you go because you enjoy that one thing, well the other people there also enjoy that activity and now you know a whole bunch of people who share a common interest with you. sometimes even the smallest things can spark a friendship maybe you and someone play the same position on a sports team that can be a great reason to be friends or to even talk, doing extra curricular activities gets you out of your comfort zone and makes you feel just open and wanting to talk to people. When going to a certain activity thinking of how the people there are gonna act is a huge thing but most likely the environment is very welcoming and it makes you want to keep doing that one thing with the same people because of how they treated you. In conclusion making friends is a big deal and doing an extracurricular activity can play a huge role and help with making friends.  If students want to have fun they should want to get their grades up. We teens and pre-teens anticipate so much from the everyone and everything, but we don't understand when our parents or teachers want us to succeed.  We all know where there are friends, there are foes. When you group a bunch of developing teenagers going through puberty, where emotions and hormones are swarming around, you get a sort of cesspool of emotion. Yes, at times there will be drama, fights, gossip, harassment, and many other things normal to the life of every day teens. Some may say this is a lie, but it is very well the cold hard truth. People won't always get along it's apart of the human nature, and as you're growing up you are still trying to figure out what you do or don't get along with.  In today's world, things like video games, cell phones, and computers fill up teenagers lives and distract them from things like homework. Schools and classrooms however, either have don't have those distractions or put limits on them to keep students working and not playing games or texting. If some people can't even complete their homework because of these distractions at home, then how will they complete their daily home schooling assignments on top of that? Student work completion would drop and their futures will be impacted dramatically. Many people, especially teenagers, need guidance and restrictions in order to get work done. Even though some students have already created that habit for themselves of getting work done, others have not and giving them an option of distance learning will be devastating for them.  For example, teens in charge of the yearbook have a entertaining time making sure their product is pleasing to the eye, so that our school has something valuable to sell to students, and so that they can look back on all the great memories they had at our precious school. Nevertheless, at the same time they're expressing their creativity into the book. Also, the art students create posters and fliers to advertise upcoming school events so that everyone can enjoy that event with their friends. I know by experience that creating colorful, bright papers is a fun-filled activity to do. Plus, some students who are in the Environment Protection Youths of Virginia group volunteer to pick up litter along the sidewalks, in parks, and many other places that would harm the environment of our beloved state if they weren't cleared and cleaned. They have a wonderful time doing just that while chatting to their friends.   Many students would say that they would never do such a thing, that they must honor their integrity, but they're lying. Teenagers are impulsive, and if there is an easy road out, we are going to take it, simple as that. For example, if a teacher gives an assignment and they say the answer key is on schoology to check our work, we're going to maybe attempt it. When we don't succeed, guess where we're going: Schoology. I'm saying that I don't trust teenagers to be able to honestly do every single assignment on their own especially if there are no eyes watching. Another example of this would be in a scenario of this said online school. Imagine that there's a big test due on the 18th in math that you haven't studied for. Today is the 17th. Everyone else has done the test and taken pictures of it in case their computers shut down, while others had malicious intent. You haven't studied at all. Your failure is imminent as you already have a C in the class and you need a C to graduate. Your heart is thumping, you don't want to seem a failure to your parents. So what do you do? Ask the teacher for an extension? No, he's too strict and he's going to say no. So you think your only option is to cheat. So you text a student who took picures for the wrong reason. You get the answers you so desperately wanted. But at what cost? You take the test and get a 70. You nearly failed, but you didn't. You find out a few days later that several students have asked for an extension and received one. That is the mindset a lot of students go through when they cheat on a test or assignment.  Summer is mean't for fun and laughter, not being kept inside all day working on a project the teacher assigned over summer break. The whole point of summer is being away from school and having a vacation. So wouldn't students prefer to do a project about something that they are passionate about? Indeed, studies show that when students do school work that they choose and are passionate about their work ends up being more creative and overall better performance. Students are just growing up and in school they aren't allowed to truly express themselves because they are either too shy or the class doesn't discuss their interests. Teenagers only want to do and listen to what they want, they don't want a teacher giving them homework over summer break not even to mention that it is not something they enjoy.  social skills, much like life skills, have their place in students' daily lives as well. It might not feel like it when teachers are constantly telling their classes to \"quiet down\" and \"focus on their assignments\", but the adults within the school building are just as aware of the psychological and emotional benefits of social interaction as teens. Therefore, students attending traditional public schools are alotted time, such as lunch or study hall, to hang out with friends and strengthen their interpersonal relationships. It is for these same reasons that most schools host memorable events outside of their eight-hour days for students to enjoy. Proms, talent shows, sporting events, and other staples of American high school serve no other purpose than providing social entertainment and positive experiences. On the other hand, online classes force students to spend countless hours sitting behind a computer screen, completely separated from their peers.  Some kids go home and play sports outside or play a game with their siblings, but most kids go home and play video games for 5 hours till they have to eat dinner or go to bed. This is very unhealthy. An extracurricular activity would get a person who usually plays lots of video games to do something active. They could play sports after school and they would still have time for video games. Playing sports after school could convince them to play sports for fun, not because they have to do something after school and they could join a league and exercise more than just after school. This would help kids stay active and healthy. After school activities for all people is a good idea because it would help kids stay active and healthy. ",

They walk into the room and it's like a minute turns from 60 to 1,000 seconds and they are stuck there forever. In this time, nothing gets done and the same amount gets learned. This class consists of about half who actually care about what the subject is, and the other half who can't seem to control themselves enough to not act out in spite of not caring. The half of the students who actually pay attention are stuck with a teacher who has to repeat themselves\u00a0a thousand times a class period when they should be on another chapter by now. This not only frustrates the teacher and the students, but it creates negative air between the students and the teacher. I mean, who wouldn't hate a teacher that talks about the mitochondria a BILLION times a day? In this situation, some perks of distance learning are shown. The students who show passion to learn can be offered one-on-one time with the instructor through video conferencing, which will not only help the faster paced learners, but take away some of the tension in the classroom.  Although, the only true downside to this is if your texting it does not always get to the other persons phone right away, depending on the amount of signal you or they have it could take 5 seconds or it could take 30 minutes  I don't know too many people that would much rather do a huge project rather than sacrifice a total of two, maybe three whole days to help out their community.  It wouldn't take long at all.  It could be as easy as picking up some trash in the local park or, if you want to you can be able to tutor kids or help out kids with a disability.  Either way, you are going to help out the community in a positive way.  What these kids are saying is, on a rough estimation, in 3,600 hour school year the don't have just 10 hours of that time to give back to their community? I find that pretty hard to believe, and I hope you would to. I have to agree that students lives are very full these days, but the can make time for their community that makes there lives full. On my opinion on refusing to do community service is either the person is lazy, or just plain mean. The students may not realize it not, but community is definitely worth their time. After doing community service, the students will have a satisfying feeling, knowing they did something good, and benefited their community. You never know, they just might like community service.   During a project a lot of planning ahead must come to mind the student will have to rush the projects as they would if it had deadlines for each couple of weeks. This allows the student to pace themselves and not feel that their project was rushed and they are not just putting all the work in one day.  I think that students should be do community serves, but not too much only. probably only like one hour or tow.  The more sleep and time a student has to themselves, the more successful they will be.\u00a0Imagine this, a student living in a rural countryside lives about 35 minutes away from his school. Their school starts at around 8:00 AM. The bus would have to make multiple stops and the student's being the first. This would mean that the student would have to be ready to leave in time for the bus to pick them up and endure the rest of the stops. Being this early they would have to be ready by about 7 AM or maybe even earlier. He or she would then have to wake up at a comfortable time maybe 6 AM or earlier. The day before they had homework which they didnt finish until about 5 PM. To get more than 8 hours of sleep at that point you would need to sleep before 10 PM. This leaves the student with not even 5 hours of the day for himself. More time could be allocated to extracurricular activities if the student did not have to worry about getting up in time for the bus.  after having to go to school and doing work on a day-to-day basis, for about ten months, is exhausting. Once students finally get out of school, they feel freedom. Having a whole two and a half to three months of no school, no waking up early, and no assignments, is one of the best feelings ever.  The distinct responsibility of having students learn rests on the very shoulders of teachers throughout nine out of the twelve months that are in a year, so the students should direly be permitted to design how they learn over the three month break that they get. This three month break, summer, to most students, is a time where they can finally let go of all their responsibilities and worries and leave them right in the classroom. Most do not think twice about what they have learned over the past semester, but instead are already steps ahead on planning what events. attractions, and/or vacations they may embark on. Teachers still try to make an effort for learners to still store information they have learned and even try add on to it by assigning projects that are aimed directly for students to complete by the next school year. More often than not, projects are long-term, and that causes the student to be continuously involved with the material and truly grasp the knowledge coming at them.  You have a job at a retail marketing company as the social media manager, making 13 dollars and hour, have only been working for them for 4 months, and is only a 15 minute drive from your house. But there is another job offer, it is also a retail market company, but you would handle finances, and get paid 22 dollars an hour, and it is the next state over and is a 3 hour drive, you have all of your family here and just bought a house, your degree\u00a0is in\u00a0consumer finances. What do you do? You seek advice from a lot of people, get their opinions, see which one is better for you future, and make a decision off of the advice given to you. Remember, get multiple peoples' advice and opinions to make a wise decision instead of an impulsive one. ",

                "content": "Leonardo Da Vinci was one of the greatest reniassance painters of the time. His study of the human anatomy allowed him to create pictures that captured the humna state. On of his most well known paintings is the \"Mona Lisa\". The Mona Lisa is a women that has sort of complacent facial features. She doesn't really look happy or sad. This was the popular thought up until a new technology was created. This technology is called the Facial Action Coding System. This technology is able to deduce what emotion a person is feeling. It is able to do this whothout the person even showing an obvious emotion. This technology can also be implenmented in many spheres of life, including in the classroom.  Students may also use this feature in art classes to really capture what the artist was depicting in the work. For instance, this new software was able to create percentages of Mona Lisa's emotions. The latest innovation in computer software may be very useful for art classes, knowing how a person may be feeling in a painting may help students to depict the artists work, a bit better. As humans, we can tell how someone may be feeling by the look on their face, or the look in their eyes. Most of us would have trouble trying to describe what facial expressions convey being happy, besides a smile. The computer can make exact percentages on each emotion you may be feeling.  In the article,\"Making Mona Lisa Smile\" by Nick D'Alto, it describes how the system can regognize how a student is feeling. The lesson changes depending on how the system reads the student's reaction. The system can read when a student is bored and change up the lesson. This is essential because it allows students to be more engaged in learning, since it will no longer be as boring as it was for them. The system may also help students to remain engaged in learning because nobody would be learning something the same exact way. In the article it says that lessons are modified to fit every student using facial recognition, so students would be learning in a way that suites them personally. This technology also keeps students more engaged because they would feel happier, because the system tries to keep students engaged and happy. In the article it says that the system can ready when people are unhappy, so the system would try to prevent students from feeling that way about learning. The system could really help students be more excited about learning.   Like in \"Making Mona Lisa Smile\" by Nick D'Alto, it could be used to show when a kid is becoming bored and let the teacher know so that the instructor could switch the lesson up to grab the kid's attention  The text states, \" Your home PC can't handle the complex algorithms used to decode Mona Lisa's smile,\" (D'Alto 7). This shows that normal computers that students would typically use cannot support this technology, making the school buy the technology that can support it. This would be a costly job and if the school cannot pay for it then the students would have to and some families may not be able to afford it  In the passage \" Making Mona Lisa Smile\" the author states in paragraph 6 line 6,\"A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,\"Dr Huang predicts.\"then it could modify the lesson like an effective human instructor.\",this kind of technology can possibly boost testing score and even help children falling behind instead of holding them back another year. The text also states in paragraph 6 line 10 that ;\"Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communcation,\"notes Dr. Huang.\". This example actually explains alot of real world issues in the classroom, such as the fact that some students refuse to even try to communicate their confusion or boredom in the classroom so then they often disengage in the lesson and miss every part that would be essential to reaching standards created by the state.  In the article \"Making Mona Lisa Smile,\" the author explains how certain algorithms built into a system, called the Facial Action Coding System, can detect human emotions. In the article, the author describes how a classroom computer can recognize when a student is getting bored or confused based on their facial expressions. This computer can change the way that the lesson is being taught so that the students are more productive in classes.  At the seventh passage, the author states that, \"Your home PC can't handle the complex algorithms used to decode Mona Lisa's smile,\" suggesting that the majority of modern computers do not have the power to actually run the software. The PCs that schools buy are almost never more powerful than the ones bought by consumers for household use, and would thus also not be able to process the data, making the technology rather useless in an educational setting.  In the article \"Making Mona Lisa Smile\" by Nick D'Alto it says that the system could \"modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor\". All students would be able to get helped individually, one on one with the system. The system also allows students to learn better because everyone learns things differently, and the system would be able to adjust for every student's learning style. In the article it says that the system can detect if a student is confused, so the system would be very valuable in classrooms because it would make sure that students are not confused. The system would make sure that students are actuallly comprehending the material.  In the education world, teachers are the backbone of the infestructure. Without teachers, the whole system would collapse. However, it may be hard for one teacher to connect with every student individually and make sure they are learning properly or if they are paying attention. This is where FACS comes in. In the article \"Making Mona Lisa Smile\", Dr. Huang talks about FACS in classrooms more in depth, \"'A classroom computer could recgonize when a student is becoming confused or bored,' Dr. Huang predicts. 'Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human istructor.'\" ",

                "content": "The students will find a way to bring there phones to school and use them while the teachers are not looking. Most of the students are already doing it, why you think putting a new policy is going to help the school it really is not, but by letting the students bring there phones in school and giving them time to use them is going to let the students know that the school trusts them, that the school doesn't think of them as children but as young and responsible adults  It may be one of the worst mistakes made by adults, thinking that taking away cell phones will solve all of their problems. It will only make kids made ,who will in turn make adults and teachers alike, miserable. If you haven't found out already, cell phones are actually for the benefit of all, even in a school environment. It will make life for teachers a breeze and likewise for kids. For all of these reasons and so many more I would ask you with the sincerity of my heart that you will please consider letting us use our cell phones in school.   The age of computers is inescapable, but it doesn't have to be. Instead of computer analyzed emotional connection, people should put their phones down and ask each other how they are. Not every person wants their emotions analyzed, especially in schools. Students bonds with teachers are simply student to teacher; a child must trust an adult before they talk about their feelings. Computer facial technology might be helpful, but not in schools. This technology falls flat in the category of connection. Don't take the easy way out, instead of analyzing emotions with a computer, ask someone how they are. If a student looks upset, sit down and talk with them. Show someone they are valuable and deserve one on one human interaction  If you put the policy that students can use their phones at free times and lunch periods then teachers wont be interrupted anymore and will just have to worry about teaching the students about what they have to learn to pass to the next grade.  If students do use their cell phones, they will not be paying attention to the teacher or what they need to know. Without the second policy, students' grades will drop lower and lower because they are not learning what they need to. This is just one more reason why the only way to go is to ban phones in schools at all times.  School is a requirement for all children and young adults in the country, so distance learning would be beneficial to any students who are unable to attend.  One reason students should be allowed to have phones is in case there is an emergency.  To keep kids focus they shouldn't bring there phones to school or if they do bring there phones to school then give it to the office or your teacher to hold on to it until school its over.  Banning phones in school is the right choice because school is a place of learning.  If cell phones were allowed during classes, instead of only during lunch periods and other free times, they would be put to use constantly. Students would be able to communicate through text message throughout the classroom, and the teacher would never know. If a student had an Internet connection on his/her phone, they would be able to play games, go on websites that are not allowed in school, and so on. This would all take place right under the teacher's nose, but they would have no way of knowing what was going on. This could be a serious problem for a student's education too. Since cell phones are such a distraction, Students could miss important lessons taught that day, and may fall behind. ",

If one side of an argument has more people, that argument will become more popular among moderates. Multiple opinions help fianl decisions when acknowledging bandwagons.  Technology make the lives easier of millions of people.  It makes communication easier and more convenient.  People all over the world want to integrate technology into as many aspects of their lives as possible.  Schools are jump on this bandwagon by integrating online distance learning and video conferencing into their curriculum.  Some educators find this would enhance the education of students, because they can learn during most any circumstances, but some believe this would be much more challenging and inconvenient because of internet issues and the situation of students when are are absent from school.  Eeveryone should have a say in what goes on where ever it is that they live. We the people make up the government. Who draws the line that states whether or not you are allowed to vote. We do! Therefore we should be able to decied ourselves who can be our president to the United States of America. It is niot fair that we need to elect others to have our submission be made. Even when we tell our electors who we choose, they might turn arouhd and vote for the other person. In  Source 2 \"The indefensible electorial college : why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong by Bradford Plumer\"  backs up my response when stating,\"In the same vein, 'faithless' electors have ocasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please...\". That to me my friend, is not fair at all.  Our country prides itself on being \"the land of the free, and the home of the brave,\" yet our people are being discouraged at every turn by our government. The popular opinion of our people is that the government is out to get us, and there's not much evidence to contradict that. The electoral college system allows for the government to be run by men who didn't fairly win over our country, and isn't accurately representing our views. It's rife with corruption, and allows money to buy power. If we remove this system in favor of a popular vote election would encourage more popular policy, make our government closer to the people, and have little to no negative impact on our country.     Also, with the embarrassingly low voter turnout the USA has already, having a confusing, old-fashioned and unfair system of electing leaders will only decrease the amount of citizens that actually go to the polls. Studies like the one published September 1st, 2012 by the American Research Institute, have shown that the average American person doesn't know very much about their country and how it works. Those that do are a minority. So, why would the government that is supposed to be looking out for, protecting and listening to its citizens still use a system that only deters already ignorant people from participating in elections?  Yes you will have a lot less people that end up doing it, but the people that do will be excited, motivated and ready to make a difference in the world one community at a time.   People can be complicated, one may never know what is going on in another's life. Every person is different, no one is the same as the next in any way, shape, or form. Taking classes from home would help eliminate those who are uncomfortable in the environment an everyday school would have, such as those with anti-social tendencies or anxiety. Having so many students in just one building causes many conflicts, whether they be through two students, or between a student and their teacher. Within a school, it is inevitable for there to be an issue depending on how one may react and feel.  When our great leaders died they're visions didn't die. They wanted the people to be in charge of who runs there country and what happens in them. Why is this not happening the way our founders wanted it. Having the Electoral College is not a bad idea but, its not a great one.  How are we supposed to trust these electors if we dont even know who they are and their background until after the election? Who even are these electors i wondered. I figured out that all the electors are actually anyone with a brain and not holding a public office, fantastic. So how do i know they are reliable and going to do whats best for my state and our country? Voters dont even control whom their electors vote for most of the time which is kind of scary. Some electors are even faithless in their party's canidate so they dont even vote for them at all! How can we rely on a group of people who dont rely on their party? ",

As the author said, we should not let doubt stop us from discovering a great planet. We can come up with the technology to some day visit this planet. With the correct technology anything can be possible.  NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft has found something while circling  Mars. But what is it, they have seem to have found a face formed into the rocks. Is this new discovery actually a face or is it just another rock formation.  The believers and the non-believers of the face on Mars are waiting anxiously to find out what it is. Is it a rock formation or is it an actual human face, no one knows  I find it highly unrealistic that NASA would even have been able to determine what the Face was forty years ago, much less hiding a discovery of extra-terrestrial life that could make a huge profit for the space program. And, had NASA really claimed that the Face was an object built by otherworldly life, surely someone would let the cat out of the bag. Not to mention that, if the vast majority of NASA believed it was an alien monument, do you really think that they would wait eighteen years to investigate the subject again? On top of all of this, it's simply illogical that aliens would create such a thing. As far as we all know, the supposed \"aliens\" on Mars have never come in contact with a human, much less seen one. That only leaves possible explanation; aliens created a monument that of which coincedentally resembles a human head. An absolute coincedence.  The evidence is all layed out, mishaps and near-mishaps, an impending catastrophe all too possible for comfort, unfair to potential voters. The Electoral College doesn't deserve its defenders. 2000 proved it, the voters have spoken up, and it is indisputably irrational to continue to rely on it. The system has been around for a while, and it will stay in place for the next few years, most likely. However, because of the light now being shined on its faults, it could have a chance to be reformed for the better.       \u00a0  they might find out more information on the situation.   it would take years to discover anything beneficial  Many scientist are looking for a way to get samples of rocks,gas,or anthing else that they can use to find out more about venus but they cannot do that  In conclusion the reasons for exploring Venus include how close it is to the sun, how similar it is to Earth, and how it could have supported life forms long ago. Yes, it is very dangerest because of high temperature and pressure. But if we come up with a way to lower the temperature and pressure it will be surely worth the work put in. These reason are way we should try to visit Venus in the future.  All of these facts are provide the possibility of being able to make human contact on Venus. Not only would that allow scientist to further research what Earth may become, but if humans are able to reside on another planet, it would greatly help rid overcrowding and Venus may be a future inhabitable location for humans.   They write about NASA wanting to know as much as possible about one of our closest neighbors, but don't give enough reasons as to why it's worth it. With acidic atmospheres ripping through machinery, technologies don't stand a chance on the Venusian surface. With the science that we have, the most we can hope for is a jet-like expirience, flying several miles above surface so that the pressure doesn't crush us instantly. Venus is additionally prone to constant volcanoes, earthquakes, and storms deadly enough to take out machinery. Given all this information, it seems like the author is trying to deter us from missions to Venus instead of promoting it, as they planned. ",

Nick D' Alto says \"Imagine a computer that knows when you're happy or sad.\" The author of this article talks of how it will improve ad placements by whether you smile or frown, however I know for a fact social medias, especially Facebook, are already basing information on preferable ads by just what material you look at. Why is it necessary for a program to constantly scan our face just to see if we like something or not? This gives the computer so much power of constantly knowing what your exact emotions are on everything. It is just so unnecessary that it causes one to question why in the world would we risk giving computers that kind of power. Also, is it appropiate to constantly scan childrens' faces as they are trying to learn? Would there be a security system in place or parental agreement necessary that would allow the permission of constant invasion of privacy in the name of education? There are many ethical questions and unknown future outlooks that one would not want to subject children to that sort of test of safety and security.  Humans can often acknowledge how they are feeling, but the acknowledgement itself does not allow them to feel better. As stated in the article, \"They even indicate the difference between a genuine smile and a forced one\" (D'Alto 7). This line states that the lab partner will be able to tell a difference netween a genuine and meaningful smile from a harshly forced smile. There is a difference between the two because smiling will not make you happy although it is a happy gesture. The machine informing someone that they need to smile will not actually change the emotions of that person. Politicians and celebrities are major culprits of this action. They often smile as they are told to do, but they are not always genuine. They are typically hiding something from their spectators such as when they are not being truthful (D'Alto 8). Just because famous people smile when talking or looking at their audience does not change whether or not they are happy individuals. If humans themselves are unable to change their emotions when they can detect that something is wrong, then machines will be unable to do that also. Although it can give people a precise measurement of their emotions, it will not change how they feel. Therefore, investing in this system would be extremely useless and wasteful.  like its says in paragraph 6 \"Imagine a computer that knows when you're happy or sad\". For example if you smile when a web ad appears on your screen a similar ad might follow. But if you frown the next ad will be different \"A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored \"Most human communication is nonverbal including emotional communication\" noted Dr. Huang \"So computers need to understand that too  In the article \"Making Mona Lisa Smile,\" the author explains how certain algorithms built into a system, called the Facial Action Coding System, can detect human emotions. In the article, the author describes how a classroom computer can recognize when a student is getting bored or confused based on their facial expressions. This computer can change the way that the lesson is being taught so that the students are more productive in classes.  In the education world, teachers are the backbone of the infestructure. Without teachers, the whole system would collapse. However, it may be hard for one teacher to connect with every student individually and make sure they are learning properly or if they are paying attention. This is where FACS comes in.

'Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human istructor.'\"  Slip into a world where emotions are easily read. There could be no mind games, no pettiness, and no suffering in silence;this could be the new reality. In the article \"Making Mona Lisa Smile\" by Nick D'Alto, he introduces a new concept created by Thomas Haung:Facial Action Coding System software. This programming system allows computers to register all of the emotions on an individual's face, reguardless if they are mixed. ",

                "content": "The answer is that they would not. If NASA went worldwide with their \"face\" they would make more money than millionaires or even other space academies. It does not make sense that the academy would keep an alien encounter hidden.   I find it highly unrealistic that NASA would even have been able to determine what the Face was forty years ago, much less hiding a discovery of extra-terrestrial life that could make a huge profit for the space program. And, had NASA really claimed that the Face was an object built by otherworldly life, surely someone would let the cat out of the bag. Not to mention that, if the vast majority of NASA believed it was an alien monument, do you really think that they would wait eighteen years to investigate the subject again? On top of all of this, it's simply illogical that aliens would create such a thing. As far as we all know, the supposed \"aliens\" on Mars have never come in contact with a human, much less seen one. That only leaves possible explanation; aliens created a monument that of which coincedentally resembles a human head. An absolute coincedence.  The author states that scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa when the face appeared. This shows that they have seen things like this before and they knew that it wasn't real, or alien like. Another example that the author proves is that Garvin said it reminded him of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. The camera on board MGS had to peer through wispy clouds to see the face and perhaps alien markings were hidden by haze. Also NASA can be hidding information about the Face. But, you can see that the Face is formed by shadows, and not an alien haze.  There you have it. The Face sadly wasn't built by aliens, it was just a natural landform that happened to have some pretty neat features to it due to shadows. There is no way around it, because the pictures don't lie. It is even more obvious that it is a landform because ones just like it exist on Earth! Even though it would've been very interesting for it to have been actually created by aliens, it was just a natural landform in the end.  The \"face\" isn't any perticular shape that any man or alien would want. The landform would be shaped as a circle, square or any other simple shape, and it would not be so ridgid and cracked. If you were to look at the photo furthest to the left, you would assume that it resembled a face, but If you compair that photo to the one taken twenty-five years later, you would begin to understand that to photo was out-dated and that the camera was not as clear as the one taken later. In addition, why would an alien make a structure of a human's face.   The Face Theorists weren't satisfied with it being just a landform and tried to find evidence to prove NASA wrong.  The Face Theorists found out that the location and date of the April '98 photo was during a cloudy winter.  Skeptics said that the alien markings were hidden by the haze.  Aliens never made the Face of Mars and the Face of Mars isn't real at all! It's just a natural landform by having the shadows covering up most of the landform making it appear as a face. For the conclusion, Cydonia has a natural landform on it that appears itself as a face using the shadows to make the illusion.  It does look like it could be from another living organism, but it's just a rock on the planet. In our newest image of the rock, it turns out that the face has dissapered. There is no evidence of this being created by aliens, rather it was created by wind and water that has been found on Mars. The reason you might believe that this was indeed aliens, might be the fact that the news has blown it out of poportion. It's just the rock that had some interesting shadows and holes that made it look like a human face.  In conclusion, the face is just a natural landform. It may look like a head, but that is just because of the unusual shadows that the mesa has. If my co-workers and I thought this was actually proof of alien life, why would we hide it from you? What is the point in hiding that kind of information?  So, while some conspiracy theorists would like to think that aliens created this well-known face on Mars, they are incorrect. The face on Mars is just a natural landform that was wrongly perceived by the public. By advancing in digital technology, understanding the effect of shadows, and realizing that there is no evidence to support aliens on Mars, it can be concluded that the face on Mars is just another peculiar natural landform.

                "content": "People are facinated with the Man on the Moon and the idea of Martians, but most people do not think about life on Venus. Venus is the second planet from the sun and shares many geographical features with Earth. However, studying this planet is made difficult by the dense and toxic atmosphere, high temperatures, and violent weather. Despite this, some people think that Venus should still be explored, and the author of \"The Challenge of Exploring Venus\" is of this opinion.  When talking about something as dangerous as exploring another planet, it is easy to see that our Earth bound technology simply cannot do the job. in paragraph 5 of the article, the author describes an idea that was thought up by \"The National Aeronautics and Space Administartion\". This idea is to have humans 30 or so miles above Venus for exploration. The author claims how this would be beneficial in keeping humans safe from the Venusian landscape. However, The author does not support this idea well, as he goes on to say how not much exploration can be done from there, and the conditions would still be extremely dangerous but \"survivable\". Also in paragraph 7, the author explains how NASA is working on other approaches to study Venus. He explains how they are working on some simplified electronics, made of silicon carbide, that have been testedd in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface. This may sound like a good thing, but it is far from one. This is because the author finsihes by saying that the electronics lasted only three weeks. If a computer can't withstand Venus's conditions longer than three weeks, I am very doubtful that a human can. This proves my point that our technology is far too inadvanced for such a task like exploring another planet. Therefore supporting my claim that the author did a poor job in supporting this idea.  Venus used to be covered in oceans and supported life. Additionally, Venus still has features that are similar to Earth's such as a rocky sediment with valleys, mountains, and craters. Insight into the Venusian landscape would further allow astronomers to determine how closely related Earth and Venus were. The author also states that humans should not be limited by their fear to go out and explore. In the final paragraph of the article, the author describes how human curiosity will lead humans into many intimidating expidentures. However, the author believes that travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited simply due to danger, and humans should travel as far as their innovation will take them.  In conclusion, since our technology isn't advanced enough, it would take far too many years to do, and the human and money costs wuold be outrageously high, we should not explore Venus. Exploring Venus proves to be very dangerous, and we have proved that we are no where near being ready for such a task. We would first need to advance our technology for the task. This would take years to due, it would also use up a ton of money, and put people in serious danger. The author did a terrible job of supporting the idea that exploring Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dnagers it presents. For one, there were not enough facts presented in the article that were beneficiary to the idea. Also, of the pros that were present, the cons outweighed then tremendously. Exploring Venus proves to be a terrible idea, atleast until we are actually ready to do it.       These are all questions that need to be considered when brainstoming the idea of visitng another planet. The author of this article is avoiding all of these mainstream problems by simply saying it's worth the risks, when it actaully is not. In paragraph 3, the author explains all of the dangers of Venus and how they can affect humans. He explains, \" On the planet's surface, the temperature averages over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet.\" Considering that this is true, we can definitrly assume that condition on Venus are severly dangerous, and a lot of people may get hurt trying to explore it. The aurthor also states, \" These conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth; such an environment would crush even a submarine accustomed to diving to the deepest parts of our oeans and would liquefy many metals. What the author is stating here is that not even our strongest materials and creations can withstand the conditions on Venus. This means that in order to explore Venus we have to design all new machinery, which would cost a lot of money, not to mention the human costs as we would need humans to test things out. He also makes it notable that venus has the hottest surface of any planet, despite not being the closest to the sun. All of these facts are serious concerns when regarding human safety as well as propr functioning of machines. Even if exploring Venus was a possibilty, would it be even be worth it after all of he human costs and money costs or paid. What we are discussing here is putting human lives at risk, and spending a ton of money on a project that is no where near being ready ready to present. These reasons as well as the provided facts assure me on my claim that the author did a terrible job of supporting this idea of exploration.  The author gives great examples of ways too explore the planet safely and effectivly, also he gives reasons why it would be beneficial.   While the author does list a few good reasons for Venus exploration, it is my belief that they also include many reasons not to explore this dangerous planet. This inclusion of the \"cons\" of exploration hurts the thesis more than it helps it, and damages the authors argument.  Clearly, the author has efficiently and convincingly supported the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. By describing all the information about the existence of other life forms and the similarities to Earth that we could potentially learn from the study, the author proves how worthy Venus is to be discovered. The author also rebuttals one of the main concerns for traveling to the planet by explaining how plans are being developed to make travel and living conditions surviveable, safe, and efficient for both humans and machines. In \"The Challenge of Exploring Venus,\" the author was able to convey and support the idea that Venus is worthy of exploration.  According to the author of the \"Challenges of Exploring Venus,\" he believes that it is a good idea to pursue more knowledge of the planet Venus. The author feels that getting to know our sister planet is important, and that there are ways to explore this planet safely and effectivly  Throughout the story the author does list at least one benefit to exploring Venus. In the story he writes, \" it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system.\" Yes i can agree that would be a great reason to explore Venus, ",

                "content": "Having different points of views means to see how other people react and respond. When you get a new point of view you can make a pro and con check list. A pro and con check list is when you list all of the good things and list all of the bad things for that one opinion. These check list are very versatile, and can be used in many different ways. One example is, picking a restaurant\u00a0to eat at, for the pros you could say, the food tastes good, but the waits are long and the service is not that great. So now you decide you do not want to eat there and you go to an even better restaurant. Another example is, for spring break you want to go on vacation, but you also want to stay home and rest. When you make a list you can decide witch one you want to do most or the one with the most pros listed. Asking others for their opinions can persuade your choices and also give you ideas. Overall, having other peoples opinions can better your life as well as theirs  I often have trouble making decisions about anything, I could be asked what I want for lunch and an hour later I still wouldn't have decided what I want for lunch. For example, I didn't used to eat breakfast at McDonalds, but one day I was hungry and I couldn't decide on what I wanted for breakfast, so I called a few people and asked for a few opinions about Sausage Mcgriddles. Some people said they were terrible, so terrible in fact they would be comparable to eating dirt; however, many more people said that Sausage Mcgriddles were delicious, they said that biting into a Sausage Mcgriddle was like biting into a world of pancake, syrup, and sausage heaven; they said it was a whole breakfast in one sandwich. So, now that I had seen from both viewpoints of the situation I made the choice of eating a Sausage Mcgriddle; and in my opinion it was the best choice I could've made.  Once, there was a woman named Generic_Name who was tasked with budgeting her family's money and spending it in the best way. She needed to decide whether to stay home during Spring break and spend a little more on food and eating out more often, or she could go on a vacation and use less money on dining out. There is no bad decision here, she thinks, but the vacation that her family wants is very expensive so budgeting would be harder. She asks her friend, Generic_Name, who just took a family vacation, about whether she should take out money to spend on this lavish vacation. She decides, based on Generic_Name's opinion and based on her own, that she should allot funds to this vacation that the family wants over Spring break, and eat out less often. She found later that she made the poorer of the two decisions. Did you know that many people around the world receive advice every day, and learn that the advice they received was incorrect. Those people deeply regret their decision that they made earlier that was incorrect  You are walking through all the different houses. There are so many to pick, and you have to choose the right one for the right price. This house looks aesthetic, but this one's cheaper. This one has a bigger backyard, but this one is in a better community. There are too many ways where you could go wrong.\u00a0You end up calling up your friends to help you look through the options. You've all been there before, whether it was making decisions as big as buying the right house or as small as what restaurant to eat at.  If someone were to ask one hundred different people what their favorite food is, they would probably get 100 different answers. This can be applied to advice because, if someone were to ask several different people for advice, they could get completely different advice from different people, and, chances are, some of the advice can really help instead of giving the person that needs advice useless information floating around. For a moment, imagine that it's time to vote for the President, and person 1 has no idea of who to vote for.  So person one goes back to his/her good friend person 2, then asks, \"Person two, who are you voting for?\" Person two replies with his/her chosen candidate, and person one asks several other people, and finally, person four tells person one about the candidate that he/she has chosen, and person one also votes for that person, because from what person four said, that person will do great things as President. If person one had just asked person two who to vote for, he/she never would've known that person four had chosen the candidate that was right for person one's beliefs. Another benefit to getting multiple people's solutions is that the different advice can be applied to the same problem until something works. For example, person one is trying to fix that pesky flat tire on his/her car, and then the advice that person two and person three gave. Because person one can't get person four to help, because person four is on vacation in Norway, person one decides to apply the advice of person two and person three to see if something works, and it turns out that person two had good advice once person one figured out what person two was trying to say. Basically, multiple answers can lead to the best answer and many solutions can be applied to the same problem until something works.  When you actually have something to do after school, you are out running about, having fun, and you aren't even thinking about sitting on your phone, eating all the chocolate covered pretzels in the world. Knowing myself, all I want to do when I get home is eat, and of course, sleep. Being lazy leads to weight gain. Many students my age care about how they look to others. You have to be \"skinny\" to \"fit in\" or \"thick\" for boys to like you. It's always good to stay in shape and after school activities may help you with that. Doing what you love makes you more energized. Most clubs have fundraisers you can volunteer for and contribute too. You can stay up at night planning about it, making up cool ideas that'll keep you awake. Overall, no student should just sit at home, doing nothing but eating, if they have a choice to join a club.  The safest place on earth for anyone on earth is their home, you eat, sleep, and live in your home so why should you not learn there too? Schools used to be the traditional option for learning and education but with students becoming a danger to one another and teachers finding it difficult to deal with certain students its seems as though the system is falling apart. Home schooling is one of the options that many parents are choosing to use as an alternative and this is with good reason. Home schooling is more student-centered than public education and can groom a student differentlly depending on the program  if someone gives you advice that you do not agree with and you get upset just remember that everyone does not think exactly like you. People have their own personal opinions and they will sometimes tell\u00a0you something that you do not like or want to hear . Now if someone gave you advice that you do not like do not ignore it take it as constructive criticism and listen to what they say and have a open mind about it. For example: Lets say you made some food and you add a little to much salt and your friend tells you that it is was to salty and that maybe you should have added less salt but you find the food to taste just right. Next time maybe dont add as much salt. This way you listen to your friends advice even though you disagree and if you find it alright\u00a0and if they find the food better then you both dont lose nothing. And theres other ways to deal with this situation like not cooking that meal, but you decided to listen to your friends advice and in the end it all worked out. Its ok if people have different opinions then you and their advice isnt what you would like to hear but its good that you learn from them.  think that if you didn't have the students at our school do community service you would be doing them a great injustice. When we are so privileged to have a nice home, clean water, and a meal on the table every night we should at least be able to go out for an our or two and help someone else who isn't as privileged. Its hardly a great burden to get up from the computer or desk you are at, put on a pair of old jeans and a t-shirt, and go out and help. So I ask only one thing of you; please set aside one day, one measly day, to have all of the students in our school wander out into the community and help someone.  This takes some stress out of your choice because then you know what the majority thinks. At the end of the day it is still your choice to make, regardless of what anyone thinks or says. There are an endless amount of decisions that people seek personal opinions on no matter how serious. When you're going out to eat with a group you ask them where they want to go. The NFL or NBA Most Valuable Player isn't chosen by just one person, it's asked about by fans, coaches, and players to see who the majority thinks deserves it. Now this does not guarantee\u00a0the right choice will be made, but in the past it has proven that it has the potential to be helpful. ",

                "content": "It is still possible to have a tie though because there are 538 total votes and since that is an even number then it can happen. And if there is just a stlight difference and instead the electoral college creates a landslide then that isn't representing the actuall number of the votes by the people. Once again you are being cheated out of your sya it the election. The hardest thing to understand is why people would still support something that doesn't support them. The electoral college basically throws away your votes and replaces them with theirs. And once again, it is possible for ties in the electoral college due to the even number of votes.  The electoral college gives an easier way to get  tie, and although a tie hasn't been a main focus, it can prove to be a problem.  There are many reasons that the Elctoral College is unfair to the voters of the U.S. State inequality, diaster, ties, and people loosing the urge to vote. The list goes on and on and if this doesn't make you see what is wrong with this system than I don't know what will. I hope you take this information to good use and use it to tear down this unfair system once and for all. If we really want to be a democracy, than we have to do away with this system. Many of Americans believe that this is the best way and several have published interesting papers on that topic that may chaneg the minds of people who are still for it. I hope this dream to get rid of the unfair and terrible system that is the Electoral College is accomplished soon.  In conclusion, the electoral college is ineffective and outdated. we should no longer use this as a system of defining our president. Even though a winner is often more clear, there is still a possibility of a tie between candidates. People who support the Electoral College also argue that its a good thing due to swing states having more attention payed to them and therefore being more careful in their decision. However, this reasoning is flawed in that it assumes that citizens of a state are more likely to inform theirselves thouroughly simply because their vote holds more value, in a sense. Also, candidates would no longer pay special attention to swing states if the electoral college weren't in place so the votes of these citizens wouldn't be held above the rest. Increased value of votes is not a good thing, which this argument also assume. It is the best decision to abolish the Electoral College.    In the article, \"The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong,\" Bradford Plumer states, \"And if an electoral tie seems unlikely, consider this: In 1968, a shift of just 41,971 votes would have deadlocked the election; In 1976, a tie would have occured is a mere 5,559 voters in Ohio and 3,687 voters in Hawaii had voted the other way.\" Being that there is a lesser number of votes counted in an election due to the Electoral College, there is a highly greater chance of the outcome resulting in a tie rather than showing a clear winner. If the election was based off of the most popular vote, there would be a higher number of votes for each candidate, therefore reducing the chances of ending in a tie. Secondly, in the article, \"What is the Electoral College?\" the Office of the Federal Register wrote, \"The Electoral College consists of 538 electors. A majority of 270 electoral vote is required to elect the President.\" This statement shows that the Electoral College requires more than just the majority of citizen's opinions. If\u00a0 at least half of the population votes one way, there should be no question about who is the winner. The most popular vote system would award the candidate that was favored by at least half of the population, therefore providing a clear and fair election. Clearly, the most popular vote sysytem would significantly benefit the American Society.  In Source 2, paragraph 12 it states, \"Perhaps most worrying is the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote.\" This is a big worry because the electoral college holds a total of 538 votes which is definetely possible to cause a tie. If this were to happen, then the vote would be thrown to the House of Representatives where state delegations would vote on the president. Then the concept of the presidential campaigns would become pointless because the point of campaining is to try to win over large, swing states to ensure more votes. Because the bigger the states population, the more votes they hold in the electoral college. But that would only work if it was in the Senates hands because the amount of representatives in the Senate for each state is based off of population, whereas the amount of representatives in the House of Representatives is always two for each state. So if the vote was thrown into the House of Representatives hands, then whichever candidate who holds claim over the most states, regardless of size, would almost automatically win the election because each state holds equal say in their vote.  The number of electors in the Electoral College consits of 538 electors in total, which makes a tie completley possible, although it has never happened, in the past only a few more votes were required to create this unlikley problem  It has this ability, because to be a tie both canidates have to have 269 votes which is highly unlikly. To have a President chossen majority has to vote one way (270). Now with a \"winner-takes-all\" system that his country, USA, has, there are only so many combinations of states' votes for one party that there would be a tie. Since the beggening of the Electoral College there has only been two ties. The Electoral College does make it easier for there not to be a tie, because more people voting into selected individuals then having them vote makes it easier for less mess ups and faster counting of votes.  Besides the power it takes away from the common man, some could say that the system itself is very inefficient compared to what it could be. Even though it has a very low possibility, the fact is that a tie is possible due to the electoral college having an even number of votes.  Bradford Plummer believes that one of the most worrying thoughts is that there will be a tie with the electors. If that were to occur the elction would fall into the hands of the House of Representitives, resulting in all the states, no matter what their population is, having the same amount of votes, casuing a president that may be very far away than what the majority of the United States actually wants. This may seem unlikely but in fact there have already been many close calls. In 1968, only 41,971 votes would have deadlockes the election. In 1976 a tie would have happened if 5,559 voters in Hawaii, and 3,687 voters in Hawaii had voted the other way (The Indefensibel Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong, by Bradofrd Plummer.) A tie may occur and if it does, A lot of citizens would be very upset that the president did not win by popularity, but by the Electoral College. ",

We are also told the we have the freedom to vote once you reach certain requirements, like age and citizenship. However, are we really getting the freedom that is talked about? No. Because the Electoral College is present in today's society, our vote becomes pointless and meaningless. We become a \"popular\" vote, but really the electoral college gets to decide who becomes presidents  In conclusion, we, as the people of the United States of America, need to inderstand that the road we are headed down with the Electoral College, is not a good road. We need to stand up and allow everyone to be able to have a say in elections. With the popular vote every citizen will have they're own say in what gets made of our beautiful country. We, the people, need to make the change from Electoral College voting to popular vote becauseit gives people a say in who runs our country, an eaier way to elect someone into office, and no one state has more of a say than another.  Eeveryone should have a say in what goes on where ever it is that they live. We the people make up the government. Who draws the line that states whether or not you are allowed to vote. We do! Therefore we should be able to decied ourselves who can be our president to the United States of America. It is niot fair that we need to elect others to have our submission be made. Even when we tell our electors who we choose, they might turn arouhd and vote for the other person. In  Source 2 \"The indefensible electorial college : why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong by Bradford Plumer\"  backs up my response when stating,\"In the same vein, 'faithless' electors have ocasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please...\". That to me my friend, is not fair at all.  Politicts have been around for centuries; politics were made to keep the peace and give everyone a fair expresion to the people. We have all herd of people in political standpoint have been corrupt, but what if our own voting system was corrupt and our votes have never made a diffrence in selecting a president by the people. When we vote for our selected president is it really going to change or make a diffence on who gets elected... right? \"of course it will make a diffrence.\" As long as your states electors dont choice by who they feel is the best fit for presidency. On another note what about the Electoral college votes. Why does one canidate always get all the electoral college votes from one state? Why cant we just revert to how many votes the canidate gets?  It isn't right to select a few people from each state to decide who the President will be. That power lies with the people, and nobody should be able to take that away. The votes of millions and millions of people are out-weighed by the votes of a few hundred men and women. This is unjust and unfair in every way. If all the people in the United States wanted somebody as President, but the Electoral College disagreed, the Electoral College would win. Why should the Electoral College have more power than all of the people of the United States; they shouldn't. The power to decide who is President of the United States of America should always lie with the good citizens that live here.   In Source 3 Posner states, \"it is the electors who elect the president, not the people\". Ever since the United States has been around our lifestyle has been purely democratic. The people are supposed to the empowering body of our government and their voice is the one that should be heard. But since we have the Electoral College the voice of the people has become muffled. No longer is the presidential election a democratic event, but one that is decided through the votes of only a few chosen American citizens. Plumer observed in Source 2 that, \"During the 2000 campaign, 17 states didn't see the canidates at all\". If the people of America are truly part of our governing body then they must see the canidates and hear what they have to say. The Electoral College has driven canidates away from states that will not have much say. These states are then left to make a decision for themselves and decide based on their personal preference, they are never able to truly hear what these canidates may or may not have to offer.  The people make the decisions, the people vote for what they want and the people should be able to elect a president they believe will give them that! According to source 3 \"... it is the electors who elect the president, not the people.\" Why can't the people be the electors? If the people in the United States don't have the freedom to vote for a president of their choice, what say do they really have? Electing a president is like raising money for charity, the president does all the work but all they money that is raised goes to charity (the people). The people want someone who will help raise the money for them, not screw over their charity. Just like when signing up for a job the boss needs to see your resume, is like the people needing to see what the president can do to help their country. The citizens should be the ones making the decisions with help from the president that they believe could help with such decisions, not from electors who believe so.  Through the Electoral College America's population is represented, the government and it's citizens have equal representation, and American people can still impact the outcome of an election.\u00a0 The founding fathers of America thought of this while they created the foundation that our country proudly stands on.\u00a0 The Electoral College should stay as it is.\u00a0 It still works effectively to decide on who will become president.\u00a0 As long as the College works effectively, then ther should be no issue with it.     \"The Electoral College is unfair, outdated, and irrational.\"(Plumer, The Indefensible Electoral College) It says it all, when the Founding Fathers made the Electoral college, the country was a lot smaller than it is today. The Electoral College was needed because there was a chance that the election could be tied. Today, the country is huge. The chance of a tie 1 in a trillion chance. I feel that we should give it a try, and abolish the College. This nation stands by freedom, and voting should be a choice.     However, without it, the balance of power in America would be skewed to an unacceptable degree. States with large populations would be disproportionately empowered, without the electoral college. This leaves the smaller states' existence to be controlled by the larger states, to the dismay of the American economy and people. ",

My first reason of why we should abolish the electoral college is because of the method it is done in.  What I mean by this is, according to Source 1:What is the Electoral College?, it says, \"Most states have a  \"winner- take all\" system that awards electors to the winning presidential canididate.\" The winner- take all system is not a fair way to elect a president becuase of its biases.  Dear Florida senator, we should keep the Electoral College. The Electoral College has been around for decades, produced by the founding fathers, it was made as a compromise between the two different ways the president should be elected. One way being by a slate of senators, and another by simply popular vote. It was made so that citizens could still have their vote, but more politically advanced senators could make a decision.  In essence, the Electoral College is necessary for the balance and order in the United States to remain. It provides a fair representation and campaign for all regions, allows votes from states with fewer population numbers to have significance, and avoids the issue of trying to determine the president when neither receives the majority vote. This all shows that fewer problems arise when using this procedure, rather than if they use majority vote. \"You help choose your state's electors when you vote for President because when you vote for your candidate you are actually voting for your candidate's electors.\" This shows that the citizens still have power in choosing their candidate and it creates a balance with other parties. In conclusion, the Electoral College should be kept to preserve the integrity and equality the United States is all about.     To conclude I belive that my state senator should remove the electoral colleges. To change the election by popular vote for the president of the United States. For the fact that voters vote not for the president but for a slate of electors. Who can always defy the will of the people. It should also be removed because its simply unfair to the voters. There votes may or may not be counted or may vote for the wrong person or oppsite party. The Electoral College is unfair, outdated, and irrational.     In  What is the Electoral College?  it states that, \"The Electoral College consists of 538 electors. A majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the president.\" The popular vote can get tied up pretty easily, but it is a lot harder for the electoral votes to get tied up because only 270 votes are needed to elect the president.  Mr. Richard A. Posner states in his article \"  In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President\"  that we avoid run-off elections. \"  The Electoral College avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast. For example, Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992 both had only a 43 percent of plurality of the popular votes, while winning a majority in the Electotal College (301 and 370 electoral votes, respectively).There is pressure for run-off elections when no candidate wins a majority of the votes cast; that pressure, which would greatly complicate the presidential election process, is reduced by the Electoral College, which invariably produces a clear winner....\"  The importance in the counterclaim is that it shows that the Electoral College process had a clear winner.  In \"Source 3: In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President\", author Richard A. Posner explains that the Electoral College \"restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment of the Senate decreed in the Constitution.\" The Electoral College gives larger states more attention from presidential candidates as opposed to a smaller state. Posner continues the idea with \"the most thoughtful voters should be the ones to decide the election.\" To break it down, voters who pay close attention to the campaign will be the most thoughtful voters and they will recieve the most attention from the candidates. This reduces the amount of disputes because the presidential candidates will decide on who to give the most attention to.  This is why Wyoming has only three votes and Florida has twenty nine. It's nothing to complain about, because it's the same number of people each state has in both the Senate and the House of Representatives, meaning each state has at least three votes, decided by its population. This is not a very bad system because the states with huge populations have a bit of their power curbed by the number of electors. So if Wyoming increases its population, and Florida has its population decreased, one of the electors could be removed from Florida and added to Wyoming, balancing the scale of power between them. It's only fair for a populous state like Florida to have more electors anyway, there are many opinions that are yearning to be heard within the ginormous population, and there must be enough electors who can take it upon themselves to voice them. The Electoral College protects us from the probability of voting just because the candidate is from the same state. A majority of people will vote because of a close association with a candidate if the electoral college is abolished. This is why the electoral college only contains 538 people, because nobody wants millions of voters in California voting for the same candidate just because they are the Governor of California.  In an article by Richard A. Posner called \"In Defense Of The Electoral College:Five Reasons To Keep Our Despised Method Of ChoosingThe President\" he says \"nixon in 1968 and clinton in 1992 both had only a 43 percent plurality of the popular votes, while winning a majority in the Electoral College (301 and 370). There is pressure for run off elections when no candidate wins a majority of the votes cast; the presidential election process, is reduced by the electoral college, which invaribly produces a clear winner.\"    ",

Venus is the second planet from the sun and shares many geographical features with Earth. However, studying this planet is made difficult by the dense and toxic atmosphere, high temperatures, and violent weather. Despite this, some people think that Venus should still be explored, and the author of \"The Challenge of Exploring Venus\" is of this opinion.  Well, first of all, The atmospere of Venus has a THICK layer of carbon dioxide the covers 98% of the planet, in which makes Everything a much hoter place,but, to top it of with the atmosphere problem, the clouds in there have highly corrosive sulfuric acid. If we some how passes through the atmosphere, than we'll face ANOTHER problem with the ground. Since Venus is the second planet from our sun and with all those carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, the surface ground temperature is over 800 DEGREES FAHRENHEIT. In which with the surface and the atmosphere, it could basically melt many types of metal with no problem. Another Problem is that the atmosphereic preassure is 90x greater than our Earth, with that much preassure could easily crushed a submarine that is built to surrvive the deeper end of the ocean. From what we gather small information from our space craft, the geology of venus pretty much have erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lighting strikes.  Being the second-closest planet to the sun provides for some nearly impossible conditions for human exploration.  Venus is the second planet in the solar system from the sun that precedes Earth in the planetary order. This planet is often called Earth's \"twin\" and the \"Evening Star\" of the universe because of its brightness and relative similarity to the Earth. In the article, \"The Challenge of Exploring Venus,\" the author presents facts and figures that one could use to determine whether studying Venus would be an advantageous pursuit even though it would not be very safe. The author focuses more on the drawbacks of exploring Venus, hence the title of this work.  The second issue, according to the people who want to stay grounded on Earth, is important for both sides to recognize. The people in the second perspective say it is not safe to go to Venus. We have tried it unmanned, and the unmanned spaceship counldn't live there for longer than a few hours, so it is too dangerous. \"On the planet\u0092s surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet. These conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth...\" (Paragraph 3). This quote helps support the second perspective for wanting NASA to kept its space ships from going to Venus. As the quote says, Venus is a very dangerous planet.  The Challenge of Exploring Venus\" is an article about the positives and negatives of trying to land a spacecraft on Venus. He has a decent build-up into his first point while giving more and more small facts about our second planet.  Venus is the second planet in the Milky Way solar system, that is so close yet so mysterious. Its conditions are unhabitable and unsafe for humans, making Earth seem safe despite some dangers it also has. Venus may well have also been covered with oceans like Earth currently has.  These are all questions that need to be considered when brainstoming the idea of visitng another planet. The author of this article is avoiding all of these mainstream problems by simply saying it's worth the risks, when it actaully is not. In paragraph 3, the author explains all of the dangers of Venus and how they can affect humans. He explains, \" On the planet's surface, the temperature averages over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet.\" Considering that this is true, we can definitrly assume that condition on Venus are severly dangerous, and a lot of people may get hurt trying to explore it. The aurthor also states, \" These conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth; such an environment would crush even a submarine accustomed to diving to the deepest parts of our oeans and would liquefy many metals. What the author is stating here is that not even our strongest materials and creations can withstand the conditions on Venus. This means that in order to explore Venus we have to design all new machinery, which would cost a lot of money, not to mention the human costs as we would need humans to test things out. He also makes it notable that venus has the hottest surface of any planet, despite not being the closest to the sun. All of these facts are serious concerns when regarding human safety as well as propr functioning of machines. Even if exploring Venus was a possibilty, would it be even be worth it after all of he human costs and money costs or paid. What we are discussing here is putting human lives at risk, and spending a ton of money on a project that is no where near being ready ready to present. These reasons as well as the provided facts assure me on my claim that the author did a terrible job of supporting this idea of exploration.  This, in turn, aids in convincing readers that might have originally disgareed with the author due to the fact that Venus' \"conditions are fare more extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth; such an environment would crush even a submarine assustomed to diving to the deepest parts of our oceans and would liquefy many metals,\" (3). The author, after making this counterclaim, refutes it by talking of some solutions to this ever-looming issue: \"NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions of the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray. Imagine a blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the roiling Venusian landscape,\" (5). The author talks of how the air pressure, temperature and radiation would all be survivable for humans. Some, such as the air pressure 30 miles above Venus, would be almost identical to Earth at sea level.  The Earth comes right after Venus in the solar system, making it fairly close given the long time frame of space travel. Astronomers have discovered that it was also previoulsly one of the \"most Earth-like [planets]\" as it \"was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life\" (Paragraph 4). Venus also \"has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters\" (Paragraph 4). In the event that Venus became a viable option for humans to inhabit when Earth collapses (as mentioned earlier), humans would have already been exposed to some of the landscape there. Although this would make Venus more assimilable, its similarity to Earth does not outweigh the dangers that still come with the planet being an unknown land changing from its previous state. With this evidence the author provides an advantage to exploring Venus, but it does not hold up against the established points about Venus' overall uninhabitability. ",

                "content": "The author does not care what kind of dangers there is because he thinks Venus is a planet that is worth to study. As he tries to get a closer look at. NASA has been also trying to help make machines and new inventions that are safe for people to go up and for themselves. Although the challenges that they have read, seen, or have heard kept stopping them from figuring out how to get closer to Venus. However, they did not give up because they kept looking for other ways to explore Venus.  When discussing the exploration of Venus, most people are turned off by its reputation as a dangerous and challenging planet for humans to study. While the author doesn't stray away from these harsh extremities, they make sure to prove how these details seem insignificant and how safe travel can still be executed. The author thoroughly describes the plan provided by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) to allow astronauts to float above the fray and avoid the hazardous conditions. They provide specific qualities of the plan, such as the air pressure being close to the sea level on Earth, the abundance of solar power, and the containment of radiation, to prove how humans would be kept in a safe atmosphere. They even provide a real world connection between NASA's possible solution and a blimp-like vheicle hovering around the ground to make it easier for the audience to understand. The author combats the speculaiton of Venus being too dangerous to explore in order to further support the idea of it being a worthy pursuit.  The author says NASA has an idea on how to send humans to study Venus, \"...possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray\" (Paragraph 5). The ship would hover above, avoiding the dangerous conditions by remaining away from it. Allowing the scientists to be close enough to study some elements of Venus, and to have more context on how to understand it more, without a human possibly dying. To further support this, the author states, \"...hovering safely far above the planet can provide only limited insight...\" (Paragrah 6). The author is aware that hovering is not the most effectove technique, but he supports the idea by hinting it will still be worth it because information can still be gathered, despite the limits.  This furthers the point more that NASA is also trying to send humans to go visit and study our planet's \"twin\". The author then goes on, proceeding to help our visualization of NASA's plan, telling the reader that NASA would not directly put humans on Venus's surface, but rather have them float in a blimp-like vehicle above the startpoint of Venus's weather and \"avoid the unfriendly ground conditions by staying up ad out of their way.\" The author lastly pointed out how, even with the toasty weather, Venus' surface is still survivable for humans, even though it's not full of easy conditions.  When talking about something as dangerous as exploring another planet, it is easy to see that our Earth bound technology simply cannot do the job. in paragraph 5 of the article, the author describes an idea that was thought up by \"The National Aeronautics and Space Administartion\". This idea is to have humans 30 or so miles above Venus for exploration. The author claims how this would be beneficial in keeping humans safe from the Venusian landscape. However, The author does not support this idea well, as he goes on to say how not much exploration can be done from there, and the conditions would still be extremely dangerous but \"survivable\". Also in paragraph 7, the author explains how NASA is working on other approaches to study Venus. He explains how they are working on some simplified electronics, made of silicon carbide, that have been testedd in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface. This may sound like a good thing, but it is far from one. This is because the author finsihes by saying that the electronics lasted only three weeks. If a computer can't withstand Venus's conditions longer than three weeks, I am very doubtful that a human can. This proves my point that our technology is far too inadvanced for such a task like exploring another planet. Therefore supporting my claim that the author did a poor job in supporting this idea.  The author states, \"NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray.\". Stating ways that Venus can be studied with people not being put in danger helps get the authors point across. The article also touches on how floating above the surface could keep those studying the planet safe. Temperatures would still be high, but nothing the spacecraft couldn't handle, the air pressure would be like how it is on Earth at sea level, soloar power would be bountiful, and radiation would be no higher than the levels on Earth. The text then states, \"Not easy conditions, but survivable for humans.\". Although this would not be an easy job, it is possible to study Venus safely. The details used in this paragraph help convey the authors point that studying Venus can be done safely and that it should continue to happen.  However, NASA has nothing to gain from hiding information from the world. If anything, NASA would want the world to know about ancient aliens building landforms.  In conclusion, some people may think there is alien life on Mars because of past picture or conspiracy theories. No one can denty however, that NASA has proven the Face to be nothing but a natural landform on the Red Planet Mars. NASA has proven this by recent pictures, scientific evidence, and real-life examples and measurements. Over the years, NASA has worked hard to figure out the mystery of the face, and just recently they have discovered, with pictyures, evidence, and measruements, that the Face is just a natural landform with unusual shadowing formed on the Red Planet Mars.  I find it highly unrealistic that NASA would even have been able to determine what the Face was forty years ago, much less hiding a discovery of extra-terrestrial life that could make a huge profit for the space program. And, had NASA really claimed that the Face was an object built by otherworldly life, surely someone would let the cat out of the bag. Not to mention that, if the vast majority of NASA believed it was an alien monument, do you really think that they would wait eighteen years to investigate the subject again? On top of all of this, it's simply illogical that aliens would create such a thing. As far as we all know, the supposed \"aliens\" on Mars have never come in contact with a human, much less seen one. That only leaves possible explanation; aliens created a monument that of which coincedentally resembles a human head. An absolute coincedence.  In conclusion, NASA is either brave or very stupid not to tell people about their \"face\", or people just want to get their word out to make other people critisized, make other people feel stupid, or they just want to feel like they are correct when they are clearly not. Therefore; This \"so called face\" is not a face, but it is just a land mark that was naturally constructed by the elements and not alien life-forms. ",

If you look at the pictures from 1976, and 1998, and 2001 and in the text it says that the photo from 2001 is the most recent photo that NASA has. It still looks nothing like a face so since the 2001 picture is the most recent it shows that it is just a natural landform. It is just a natural landform. On Mars there are natural landforms everywhere and the fade away. Here on earth natural landforms are created everyday.  What I think that is, is just a simple and natural landform made by the underground volcanoes, sandy surface, and rocks that landed there.  So, while some conspiracy theorists would like to think that aliens created this well-known face on Mars, they are incorrect. The face on Mars is just a natural landform that was wrongly perceived by the public. By advancing in digital technology, understanding the effect of shadows, and realizing that there is no evidence to support aliens on Mars, it can be concluded that the face on Mars is just another peculiar natural landform.  There you have it. The Face sadly wasn't built by aliens, it was just a natural landform that happened to have some pretty neat features to it due to shadows. There is no way around it, because the pictures don't lie. It is even more obvious that it is a landform because ones just like it exist on Earth! Even though it would've been very interesting for it to have been actually created by aliens, it was just a natural landform in the end.  I'm a scientist at NASA and the Face, a lot of people seem to think was formed by aliens or is proof of alien life forms, is actually just a natural landform  Aliens never made the Face of Mars and the Face of Mars isn't real at all! It's just a natural landform by having the shadows covering up most of the landform making it appear as a face. For the conclusion, Cydonia has a natural landform on it that appears itself as a face using the shadows to make the illusion.  In conclusion, some people may think there is alien life on Mars because of past picture or conspiracy theories. No one can denty however, that NASA has proven the Face to be nothing but a natural landform on the Red Planet Mars. NASA has proven this by recent pictures, scientific evidence, and real-life examples and measurements. Over the years, NASA has worked hard to figure out the mystery of the face, and just recently they have discovered, with pictyures, evidence, and measruements, that the Face is just a natural landform with unusual shadowing formed on the Red Planet Mars.  The curiousity about Mars has been going on for centuries.  People say that there is or once was life on Mars, and now they are saying that there is a face on Mars.  Humans all around the world have questioned whether the \"Face\" was created by aliens or just a natural landform. ",

                "content": "Multiple times, the author delves into a side-topic as opposed to continuing on with the topic of Venus exploration. They start off the article with two sentences that have no relation to the story, yet confuse readers. The sentences are about Venus' nickname, the \"Evening Star\", and how even though it is a planet, it is still called this. This is completely irrelevant to exploration, as everyone knows it is a planet, and the \"Evening Star\" name is never mentioned again. Later on in the passage, the author rambles on about World War II-age computers and how they functioned properly even before the digital age. Once more, this is slightly irrelevant and does not contribute to the story at all except to add another paragraph instead of focusing on the specifics of how NASA is using them to help with Venus.  Paragraph 4 states, \"Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system. Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth\" (The Challenge of Exploring Venus). If Venus could've supported human life long ago, it is likely the planet still can. The scientific facts throughout this statement support the author's claim by having a reliable source of information, supporting the idea. Paragraph 4 reads, \"Today, Venus still has some features that are analogous to those on Earth. The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters\" (The Challenge of Exploring Venus). Venus already has Earth-like landscapes and other similar formations. This supports the author's idea of exploring Venus because it is so similar to Earth, the chances of survival are higher than any other planet.  This means there is a worthy reason to explore Venus; to discover another habitable planet. Along with successful life on Venus, our modern technology could also survive the planet. Paragraph 5 states, \"Imagine a blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the roiling Venusian landscape. Just as our jet airplanes travel at a higher altitude to fly over many storms, a vehicle hovering over Venus would avoid the unfriendly ground codnitions by staying up and out of their way\" (The Challenge of Exploring Venus). Moreover, if airplanes are already in existence, new aircrafts would need to be slightly adjusted to suit the conditions of Venus. The author's claim is supported in this quote because this is another reason Venus is worth exploring. The technology needed is already almost perfect for the planet, therefore not a problem NASA would have to approach.  Paragraph 3 of the article is all about the extreme environment that Venus presents. Venus has temperatures over 800 degress Fahrenheit, an atmospheric pressure 90 times greater than that on Earth, erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and other obstacles that prove challenging for scientists to overcome. Additionally, Venus has clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in the atmosphere which prove to be challenging to scientists. These dangers may seem impossible to overcome, but scientists have been developing new methods to further their knowledge of Venus.   The Earth comes right after Venus in the solar system, making it fairly close given the long time frame of space travel. Astronomers have discovered that it was also previoulsly one of the \"most Earth-like [planets]\" as it \"was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life\" (Paragraph 4). Venus also \"has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters\" (Paragraph 4). In the event that Venus became a viable option for humans to inhabit when Earth collapses (as mentioned earlier), humans would have already been exposed to some of the landscape there. Although this would make Venus more assimilable, its similarity to Earth does not outweigh the dangers that still come with the planet being an unknown land changing from its previous state. With this evidence the author provides an advantage to exploring Venus, but it does not hold up against the established points about Venus' overall uninhabitability.  Venus is the second planet in the solar system from the sun that precedes Earth in the planetary order. This planet is often called Earth's \"twin\" and the \"Evening Star\" of the universe because of its brightness and relative similarity to the Earth. In the article, \"The Challenge of Exploring Venus,\" the author presents facts and figures that one could use to determine whether studying Venus would be an advantageous pursuit even though it would not be very safe. The author focuses more on the drawbacks of exploring Venus, hence the title of this work.  Given these details, he uses useful information that we need to know. In the first paragraph he describes what Venus actually is. If he wasn't to do that, people might be misleaded and still assume that Venus could perhaps be a star. The author gives very useful information to describe what Venus is.  Despite claiming that \"Venus can sometimes be our nearest option for a planetary visit\", there is little evidence given that exploring and observing Venus would be of much benefit. In fact, the author seems to have found more evidence against Venus exploration, as the prior paragraph (which listed reasons that Venus was dangerous) was much more explicit and detailed than paragraph 3. The negatives of exploring Venus (such as death and wasted money or time) seem to far outweigh the positives.  The author is aware of the fact and describes how, \"no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours\" (paragraph 2). Right off the bat, the author gives their audience the mindset that it is not a good idea to study Venus. Having that fact in the first few paragraphs of the article sets the tone for the rest of the article. In paragraph three, the author goes into great detail about several of the potential dangers that can come from studying Venus because of its, \"clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid\" (paragraph 3). The frightening environment described strays the audience even further away from believing that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers  The first paragraph introduces the topic of Venus with an interesting hook, but does not give the reader their side. The reader needs a thesis, without one the reader is not going to be able to have their opinion on a topic swayed. The author's current attempt at a thesis statement , \"While Venus is simple to see from the distant but safe vantage point of Earth, it has proved very challenging place to examine more closely,\" does not state what side they are on clearly. Their best declaration of the side they are on is in their very last paragraph. The author wrote, \"Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation.\" This is a very strongly worded thesis, but would have been much better if placed in the starting paragraph. Their side on the topic was acknowledged, but not as well as it could have been if they had set up their thesis correctly. ",

                "content": "First and formost, it is my belief that we should keep the electoral college because,it has been around for so many years so the question is why consider changing it now  I understand that there have been some issues regarding whether or not to keep the Electoral college or to change the system to a more simple- election by popular vote. From my understanding, the Electoral College has worked for many years with no issues or roadblocks so to speak that have interfered or had a bias on these decisions.  \"It's offcial: The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational\" (Plumer, Source 2). Many do not like the electoral college for these reasons and many others such as it can be a distaster or because it is just plain dumb. Also there are a few reasons why the electoral college should be kept such as avoiding run-off elections or big states, but those not in favor of it out weigh those in favor of it.   There is pleanty of things wrong in this world, but one thing that is pretty good right now is the Electoral College. More times than not it has one winner and one loser, and rarely a tie. It makes sure that nobody is a favorite or feels like it. Also it shows things can change if something is a problem or needs fixing. The Electoral College is not perfect, but is not broken. Thank you for reading my letter, I hope you take it into concideration when deciding to keep it or not.   Each party selects a slate of electors that are trusted to vote for the party's nominee. Sometimes the electoral vote will not win the national popular vote. Another reason The Electoral College is a positive way of voting is how certain the outcome is. There is never failure in the counting of the votes and there us rarely a tie between two people. My favorite reason is because \"everybody is president\". This means everybody can make their own decisions and have a great amount of freedom.   There has been some conterversy between whether we should keep the Electoral College or changing the election to popular vote for the president. There are pros and cons to each method of voting. The Electoral College has been around since the beginning of our country. Most of the time it is successful (there have been a few times problems have occured but rarely it happens). As time has passed and we enter a more modern age, people have started to feel that the Electoral College does not work and we should all switch to just a regular popular vote.  In conclusion, the electoral college needs to be extinguished for many reasons. those reasons are because it doesn't let the people vote for who they want and it over rules a notions votes. And because it doesnt show the number of votes as equall. Some may say that it is good because it prevents a tie but if there is a tie then I'm sure htere are better ways to revote. we need government for the people, by the people and that isn't what the electoral college is.    Well, there you have it. My reasons are final. I feel that we should change the voting process because it would benefit the public, so everyone can know exactly what kind of impact they're making and so it does not mess up the voting process. Don't do it for the government. Do it for your own sake. If you wanna make a difference, be on my side, and we can. Together. Now my only question to you is, are you willing to make a difference?       \u00a0     Let us say, there have been many incidents where elections have been on the edge of a major dilema. Wondering why a straight up orderly process can go to the point of a catasrophe, can all be easily explained as unfair.  All can be simplified in the article  Why Even The Best-Laid Defesnes of the system are wrong by Bradford Plumer, states back to the disater factor of the election of John F.Kennedy. It states back to the 1960's where faithless electors had pushed aside the votes and sayings of Louisiana had decided to vote for whomever they had wanted. It had caused a problem of course since the votes where not even of the people, but of the selfish sick minds of the electors who toke the process into their own hands. In the same paragraph it staes back to when the state of Hawaii had sent in two slates of electors to congress. With the unreliable actions of Richard Nixion,\u00a0 had validated his opponent's electors of course to win over the campaign. once again another issue arises in the article  Five Reasons To Keep Our Despised Method Of Choosing The President, it agrees with the unfairness of the electorals by giving the example of how the Electorial College had turned off the potential voters due to the knowledge that their votes will be uncared for. In paragraph 23, it states that in the state of Texas, it was known that the votes would have know effect of the campaign what so ever. It aslo had staes that voters in politcal elections have no care rather than to express the political refrence than what the peole think or decide.  To sum it all up, the Electoral college is just an unnecassary back up plan when there is not one needed. It is unfair to the citizens and the candidate's electors are unreliable. If there was a way to keep the Electoral College, it would only be for ties. It wouldnt be needed if the vote was a clean win. When the President Election comes in the next 3 years, I hope that you consider my thoughts, because there are plenty people out there with the same perspective.    ",

                "content": "Imagine a student doing his work, and suddenly he doesn't know the answer to a problem. Fortunately, he has his cell phone in his pocket, and can look up the answer on the internet. If cell phones are allowed during class, students can easily get information of the web, without doing to work nessacery.  During tests, students can send messages back and forth on what the answers are, and the teacher would never know. This is a problem, because students who are caught cheating can end up in serious trouble.  If cell phones were allowed during classes, instead of only during lunch periods and other free times, they would be put to use constantly. Students would be able to communicate through text message throughout the classroom, and the teacher would never know. If a student had an Internet connection on his/her phone, they would be able to play games, go on websites that are not allowed in school, and so on. This would all take place right under the teacher's nose, but they would have no way of knowing what was going on. This could be a serious problem for a student's education too. Since cell phones are such a distraction, Students could miss important lessons taught that day, and may fall behind.  think that if you didn't have the students at our school do community service you would be doing them a great injustice. When we are so privileged to have a nice home, clean water, and a meal on the table every night we should at least be able to go out for an our or two and help someone else who isn't as privileged. Its hardly a great burden to get up from the computer or desk you are at, put on a pair of old jeans and a t-shirt, and go out and help. So I ask only one thing of you; please set aside one day, one measly day, to have all of the students in our school wander out into the community and help someone.  Every student is different, learns a different way and reacts differently to every aspect of the classroom. The article says a computer will be able to detect if a student is bored, but teachers have that ability already, minus the cost and invasion of privacy. Teachers are in the classroom so that they can make those personal connections with each student and ensure that they are doing everything they can to provide the best education possible. If a computer detects boredom it will just try another lesson without knowing what is best for the student. So the question that needs to be asked is why would this sort of technology be useful in the classroom?  This technology could also help both students and teachers in a long-term manner. In paragraph 7 of the article, it is revealed that this new technology could \"even indicate the difference between a genuine smile and a forced one\" (Paragraph 7). Say there is a classroom without an emotion-sensing computer. In the classroom there is a student who, behind the fake smile is dealing with something that they cannot tackle on their own. The teacher never notices, and the child goes on without help. Now imagine if there was a computer in that class   In our school I have sometimes seen problems where kids will steal each others stuff including phones, if the teachers or kids don't know who stole it or can't get it back the I can see many an angered parent suing the district or the school.  I know for a fact that I have once suffered as I thought someone had stolen my phone and I wouldn't get it back, I knew that if I would tell a teacher the whole class would be punished until someone came forward and even then my parents would be mad unless that person would get suspended or expelled.  Lets say that their is someone in the school that never likes doing homework, you may ask that person to do some community service like taking care of something. The person at first may think like why do I have to take care of something just because I don't do my homework. If you tell them they have to volunteer in a dog shelter they wont want to do it but if you also tell them they are in charge of everything and that if anything goes wrong it would be their fault. The student will probably get scared and do everything it takes to do everything good. After community service is over he will probably be a better student by doing his homework. If the student probably did change he would probably ask to see if he could do other community service.  In a student's home they have access to toys and electronics such as phones, televisions, and computers that can take their attention away from learning. However if students took classes in a school building they would not have access to as many of these distracting things, and they would also have a teacher that would be able to take any distractions they find away from them. Another way that distance learning would allow students to become easily distracted is because their is no other students around to keep them on task. By taking their classes inside of a school building students would be surrounded by other students who are also doing work. Being surrounded by other students who are also doing their work will help motivate students to continue to focus on their own assignments. Personally, I prefer to do my homework at school, in my study hall period, as opposed to completing it at home. I would rather do my work at school because I am surrounded by other students that motivate me to finish my work, and also their is less distractions around me. One specific example of how doing my work in school benefits me is when I had to complete my history project on Andrew Jackson. Instead of working on my project during my study hall period, I decided to take a nap and told myself that I would be able to finish the project at home. However, when I got home, instead of working on my project, I was immediately distracted by the television and ended up watching a six episodes of one television show instead of finishing my project. When I received my grade back on the project I saw that I had received a C+ instead of my usual A. If I would have completed my project in study hall I would have been more focused on doing the project, due to the other students also working on assignments around me, and I would have received a better grade.   Cyberbullying has become an ever greater threat to students and schools have been largely unequipped to deal with the problem head on. Online schooling would only magnify the problem by allowing problems to go undetected with the school having limited access to what is going on only when students are logged into a computer. The second problem arises from the transition that students make from high school\u00a0to college. This serves as a difficult time for students already with\u00a0hazing, bullying, and other bad social behaviors occurring. If a student is sheltered for all of their public education, from kindergarten to 12th grade, they are exposed to this harsh environment without the social skills or experience required to navigate these turbulent times. Instead of stopping the problem of bulling, online education only seeks to kick the problem further down the road.  Millions of students get bullied in and outside of schools. A lot of the time the problem never gets solved because students are scared to tell someone. If they don't tell anyone about because they're scared from that other person, they're going to continue to get bullied. They won't be able to focus anymore, so their grades will drop. The only thing that will be in their mind is the fear from that other person bothering them again and bullying them which includes; abusing them, insulting them or taking something from them like their food. This proves my claim by saying students will benefit from being able to attend classes from home because they won't have to worry about being bullied or having any problems and they will be able to focus very well.

During the 2000 election a remarkable seventeen states did not see the campaign one time nor did the people in the 25 largest media markets see a campaign ad whether it be on t. v., in the newspaper, or over the radio. If the president was elected by popular vote than every state would be considered a swing state.  For example, an election for the Senate seat representing Virginia is best decided for residents of Virginia. It would be nonsensical for a resident of another state to vote in this example. The people involved in this should be considered into the data. A right choice for a decision comes from the people that are affected and involved.  Because of the winner-take-all system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusingonly on the tightraces in the 'swing' states.\"(13) when the candidate know they arent going to win they just step back and try other states if not they know they are going to lose the elections.  Men who are running for a spot as a presidental candidate are not voted for by the citizens of that state. They have to gain supporters who then become the electors. Then the people of that state have to vote for the electors, not the person to become a presidental candidate. Voters can't even directly vote for who they want. What if you vote for a slate of electors, who are supposed to be in favor of the presidnetal candidate you want, but don't vote for him? What happens then? Presidental candidates who should actually get a chance at running for president because they didn't get enough electoral votes.  If one wanted to, an elector can completely disregard the decision of the voters and choose who they want. Considering the ratio of electors in some states to people, it seems completely non-democratic for the votes of some to be more important than the wants of the common people. Some start to feel that they shouldn't vote because their one vote wouldn't have the power to change anything, and wouldn't even ensure the election of the president they want. Another thing that lowers the morale is the absence of candidates in states that can't be won very easily. If a candidate is pretty sure he can't win over a state, he won't visit it because it wouldn't be worth his time. He also wil prioritize large states over small ones because they have more electoral votes. All of these can make a state or person feel as if the election isn't really in their hands, and when people feel like their vote doesn't matter, they don't vote.  In conclusion, the Electoral College and its electors must be disbanded so that popular vote will be used in determining the new president of the United States. According to both Source 2 and 3, the process of voting a group of people to vote for you is un-democratic. Electors, the people making up th Electoral College, can be manipulated and coerced into voting a specific candidate. Lastly, non-swing states will be ignored; this will anger and frustrate them since not one candidate tried to persuade them. Florida State Senator, you must, in the best of your ability and then some, try to topple down the un-democratic roots of the Electoral College. The people, the ones who must truly decide on the president, will be immensely greatful towards you; in a 2000 poll, 60% of the voters even stated that they want a popular-vote type of election.  This means an elector with similar beliefs to the citizens will be chosen and most likely decide their vote in consideration of popular demand. Each state is given representatives in proportion to the poulation of the state. These people can be anyone who does not work in office and maybe a regular American who is probably going to emathize with the needs of the public and if chosen correctly will stand by the option of the state. Electoral College gives a more concentrated form of voting.  Because of the \"winner-take-all\" system, certain states are left untouched by candidates who know they won't win them. In 2000, certain states didn't even see the candidates, and didn't air campaign ads, denying voters of a chance to further favor or unfavor them (13).  If two candidates receive the same number of electoral votes and tie in an election, the House of Representatives then chooses the president, while the Senate choose the vice president, but their votes may not show who voters want as president, seeing that voters often vote one party for president while the other for their representatives (Plumer 12). The vote for president is distributed unevenly, and states with many voters will only be represented by one vote. this could lead to the House of Representatives choosing a president that is only liked by a small population and this cannot easily be undone. Swing states are the only thing that can cause or prevent a tie in elections, and a tie has almost occured in 1976 in Hawaii and in 1968 in Ohio.  Citizens' wishes will not always be equivalent to what the electors vote for. This occurs partly because of the winner-take-all system. In this system, the winner of the popular vote in an individual state wins all of the electoral votes a state has. According to the Office of the Federal Register, all but two states use this system. These two states are Nebraska and Maine. As a result of the winner-take-all system, it is possible that a presidential candidate loses the overall popular vote, but wins more electoral votes and thus wins the election. This occurance happened in the infamous 2000 election, when Al Gore won the popular vote but lost to George W. Bush by a mere five electoral votes. If the public indicated they wanted Al Gore as president, why should Bush have won due to this unfair system? It simply doesn't make sense. The winner-take-all system also results in political campaigns to focus their efforts in only certain regions. Some states very predictably vote either for the Republican candidate or for the Democratic candidate. Take Texas, for instance, which has traditionally always voted red. A Democratic candidate knows he should not focus his campaign in Texas, because he realizes his best efforts won't allow him to win the popular vote there and thus win the electoral votes. Because of the tendencies of certain states, many electoral votes are practically predetermined. The states which do not typically only vote in favor of one side are labelled \"swing states\". With the way the Electoral College works, the few states which are a toss-up carry the most weight. Presidential candidates will usually spend most of their time in these swing states, and very little time in others. For example, in the 2000 election, seventeen states were not visited by either candidate. Supporters of the Electoral College view the disproportional focus of campaigns as a positive. According to Richard A. Posner's article in favor of this corrupt system, \"The Electoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment of the Senate decreed in the Constituion...\" (21) ",

                "content": "Student could work in groups to make it easier. It would not necessarily be the whole project being easier it would just be making short cuts to get to one point faster. The groups would be people who are already friends and that would motivate them to do the project because then while doing work they still hang out with their friends. Making the project easier might also mean that the students might be able to understand it better and if they do need help the can ask their peers or email the teacher.  but it can be seen as so much more than that. It will improve everyone's ability to work with others, which is a crucial skill in life. It will be challenging to combine and compromise on different ideas. If used correctly, you can figure out more about yourself, for example, if you like to work individually\u00a0verses in a group, what kind of learning style you want the project to be, what the project is on, how much work you're willing to put into it, and so many other things.  But the work can also be easier but can target he same objectives, this can be obtained if it were a student-designed project. Students know their limits and the targets for the projects so students can personally complete their own tasks and get the work done at their own pace. It would be way less stressful if students didnt have to base how much work they get done how they do the work by another persons standards that does not know what other things the student has to do in his or her life.  If the quarter back on the football team doesn't have the right fundamentals down, then the quarterback is useless. Smarts also help in groups. For a student to have a grade B average, then they must have some type of leadership in them. So for a grade B average student to be in a club or something of that nature, then the group will have a better bonding. They will be able to work together and develop into a team or group. Brainstorming ideas for ways to help the community will be able to be organized and arranged neatly.  It's been scientifically proven that if you have more choice's you are more likely to make a better choice than if you have less option's. So getting more opinion's help's you make a better choice. Like they say the more the merrier. But other than that it's also easier to rule out ones that don't work for you and if you have a lot and a lot of them just don't work for you, you have more to pick from. This especially help's when you have a big decision to make. When you have bigger decision's to make you usually go to people that are specialized in that area. Like Financial adviser's are specialized in money you would go to them if you need help on the money side. And if it's a mental problem or a bullying problem at school you would go to a school or out of school Consular to help you out. And asking for help isn't a bad thing at all. And if you really need help and you don't go to someone your only hurting yourself if you don't go.  Joining a team or group will be nerve racking at first because you might not know anyone that share the same interests as you do.  But when the team/group finally gets to talking, they will have bonded so that nobody could break them apart.  It is important to get those types of relationships because if you ever need help to do something, then your team/group will have your back no matter what the problem is.  In school, you choose who your friends are, and once you have your group, nobody else is allowed in.  But when you join one a sports team, the student council, or the yearbook staff, then you set aside your school friends and you allow yourself to gain different friends.  People that you once thought were \"weird\", or \"annoying,\" are now your friends because you realized that they actually have the same personality that you do.  Teachers, of course, have been teaching and assigning projects all year and some are easy and some are not. Projects that are given by the teacher have to be completed by the instructions given and if it is not completed that way or in that way all that hard work just went down the drain. Student- based project do make it easier because it is their idea, their instructions, and their own way. So all that hard work doesn't have to go the drain for nothing. Student-based projects can be more creative because it is made from scratch and from their own head. Teacher-based projects are usually less creative because students are just trying to finish it and get it over with. In contrast, students may take a lot of time or wait till the last minute.  If you know more about the topic its easier to do the right choice. When you know more its way easier to just do the right thing since you know a lot\u00a0about the topic already. If you know more about the topic it also helps you give other people advice on the same topic. This can help because in the future, you can help people who were in need of advice just like you. There is always more room for improvement academically, physically, and mentally. Learning is never a bad thing and can always benefit you or others in some way. When you learn it is a good thing and will always be useful someday.  Making friends while on a team or a club will be much easier, the students will have connections with others, and everyone will have something to talk about. Some students may find it hard to make friends, but by being in an extracurricular activity, there are many chances to find a long lasting\u00a0pal.   It's a great idea to talk to multiple people about something that is bothering you or you are curious about rather than one. It doesn't hurt to ask for other's opinions and it's always a good thing to do at the end. We can achieve something or resolve the problem better if we get the help of others. Someone's opinion may shape your own opinion in a totally different way and it's smart to understand and use other's knowledge to your ability. Seeking help from multiple people can have great benefits such as having different opinions to build your own opinion, different experiences to build more knowledge, and also because it's always good to have people to rely on.\u00a0 ",

                "content": "The Facial Action Coding System enables computers to identify human emotions. This new software has a promising applications for a variety of industries. \"Can we actually calculate emotions, like math homework?\" \"How can a computer recognize the subtle facial movements we humans use to express how we feel?\"  The article states that the technology associates each emotion with \"characteristic movements of the facial muscles\" and then uses those movements to calculate the spectrum of emotions based on their facial display. But some people show emotions in various ways, and the technology most likely cannot accomodate for the many different ways people express the same emotion. For example, if a student has a resting face that seems generally happy, the system might confuse this dazed face as a satisfied face and think that the student is happy with their lessons when they are actually confused or not paying attention. In the same way, if a student has a resting face that looks naturally sad, the system may think they are unhappy with their lessons, even if the student feels they are learning a lot. A lot of students also try to hide their emotions, like frusteration or sadness, with a happier look on their face, and even though the article states that the system can detect a \"false smile\", it cannot always be accurate as a person may be good at hiding their emotions and displaying a genuine smile. Therefore, since technology is not always accurate and because human beings are so various in the way they behave, the technology would not be useful in a classroom where it may misread a student's state of mind and lead them in the wrong path of education.  While there are many positives to this technology some might argue that computers cannot actually calculate human emotion. They argue that human emotion is not somehting that can or should be understood because it would ruin the entirety of feeling certain ways.  New technology is being introduced to mankind almost every second in this world, and now, the latest techonology is a computer program called the Facial Action Coding System which can identify a person's emotions. The question is whether this technology is actually valuable and for what it could be used for. Experts suggest this technology could be used in a classroom to identify the state of mind of a student to adjust the lesson they are trying to comprehend. But, even though this technology may be helpful to teachers trying to keep students active and engrossed in their lessons, the question arises of whether this techonlogy is actually worth the recources or whether what experts think is a great idea is actually an invasion of privacy.  Every living thing on planet earth has emotions. These emotions have been used since the beginning of time to express the feelings of the people around you. However, these emotions can be decieving. Someone could say they are happy, when really they are angry or upset. This is where the Facial Action Coding System comes into play. The FACS is a software that detects human emotion by tracking muscles in the face. For example, when you are happy, muscles in your face move up, and when you are sad, they move down, FACS tracks this and calculates your emotions. The creators of this software, Prof. Thomas Huang and Prof. Nicu Sebe are the leading experts of developing better ways for humans and computers to communicate. There are still some questions surrounding the usefulness of FACS, like what could this software actually be used for? One of the ways FACS may be used is in classrooms.  In my opinion, I think this techonology is useful, especially in order to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom.  The implications of technology that can detect emotions simply by reading the muscles in the face sound truly remarkable. The thought that one can tell what another is thinking simply by plugging data or maybe even a picture into an algorithm sounds like fiction, but may soon be a reality. The article, \"Making Mona Lisa Smile\" by Nick D'Alto briefly discusses the possible use of such technology in a classroom. The system could examine student's faces, and if they read to be unengaged or uninterested, could adjust the lesson to make learning more interesting to that group of students. That type of technology could revolutionize learning, and customly tailor lesson plans to the feelings of students on any given day.  Life contains many differences, includes positive and negative things, truthful or untruthful. Some people said emotions are never lie. We could figure out the statue of someone by looking at their face, and that's true. However, life is something really complicated, sometimes things in front of you don't mean like what you think. Likewise, even though the expression from people face is the most authenic, when they are trying to hide their feelings, we literally cannot know their real emotions. The changing of teenager is issue that causes headache for parents, their characters aren't the same like before, their emotions are changed. Both of them could not find the common speech, and push them further each other. That is the moment, the childrens easily fall in the darkness. For real instance, children or students aren't agree about their parent's thinking, or the education from school completely. Most of them don't say it out, or talk back. It's really affects about effective in studying and their plans in the future.  The human body has way more than just six emotions so getting a high accuracy reading on how you are really feeling is out of the question because FACS uses the a process of a 3-D model Dr. Huang states \"The process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D model of the face; all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles.\" This quote explains that it has to use a way of making a model which can sometimes take some time depending on the processing power of the computer not only that but human emotions can change quite quickly and if the pc doesnt make the model fast enough the computer can easly fail at getting and accuarate reading.  As stated in by Nick D'Alto, most human communication is not verbal. Meaning that people express their emotions by their looks or their actions, but they chose when to do this. The Facial Action Coding System takes away this freedom from students, they do not have the choice when to express what they are feeling if anyone can just use a face scanning system on them. \" Imagine being able to detect exaclty how other people are feeling, even when they are trying to hide their emotions (D'Alto 1),\" this first sentence perfectly shows how it takes away peoples freedom of when they want to express certian emotions tocertian people.

                "content": "Students have their interests, they either like something, or they don't. Something might not come off as interesting to them at first glance. They might only start to realize something is interesting to them when they take another look. If schools do an event that shows off each different club, students will get that \"second glance\" that they need. For example, my older brother wanted to join a club in high school. He looked through the website and found that nothing sounded interesting to him. He decided to look again, this time actually reading the descriptions of each club. He eventually found the art club. He read the description, thought it sounded interesting and signed up.  The students will make new friends because they all have at least one thing in common with each other. If they were to hang out more, then they could start to find out that they have a lot more in common. Making new friends at that activity will make the students want to go back to that activity so they can see their friends again. This would go perfectly with the idea that the principal had. The student wants to go to something that the principal is telling them that they have to go to. This gives the principal what they want, and it gives the students what they want.  The principles decision makes kids do something that they will most likely actually really enjoy, something that will very much assist them in getting into college, and something that will allow students to understand how to survive in the real world. It will also benefit my high school and any college any current student at my school goes to in the future. In conclusion, the decision to make all students required to do an extracurricular activity was a fantastic one.   First, students can choose a topic that they are interested in for their student project. For example, if a student likes video games, then they would be more motivated to do their project than a summer project with the topic of gardening. The students will be more motivated doing something they like, simply because they enjoy it. No one wants to do a project that no one likes. In addition to that, students may also be more knowledgable in their topic if they are able to design their project. A student could know nothing about gardening and complete a poor project. However, if a student knows everything about video games, then that student can create a very excellent project, because its a topic they like  When a student feels responsible for a project, they will go to greater lengths to ensure that they do it right, and that it turns out good.  No one wants something that is entirely their own to turn out bad.  The students will have greater creative liberty with how they execute it.  This flexibility will accomodate every student, no matter how they learn best.  Wether it be writing a paper, painting a picture, creating a diagram, or making a website, the students would be able to learn in whatever way they do best, no matter what that way may be.  Students will be better at ensuring that all details of the project are included.  If they are the ones to decide what the project includes, there is no way they can fall short of the information required.  Making it a student led project will allow the students to take a significant amount of pride in it, that does not come with other projects.  Having the students design their own projects would allow the students to try new styles of projects.  Perhaps the teachers they have do not assign a specific type of project that a student really enjoys.  The students would be able to do that type of project.  The students could also have the desire to try a new style of project.  The projects that are assigned at school can often be redundant or generally overdone.  Having the students design their own project will allow the students to try something new and possible adopt a preferred way of completing projects.  Having the students do the projects that they want to so will also help communicate to the teachers what the students want.  When a teacher sees a new and unique way of leaning, they could potentially use it in the future as a new and more captivating way of teaching.  The design of what project the students are given in the summer should completly be their own design not the teachers. If the students design their own projects they will mostlikley do something they like . If they do something that they like they will get it done and the learning experiance will be so much better then if the teacher designed what the students where told to do over the summer . It being said if the students where able to design the project they would enjoy it and be able to get all supplies they need for it because the teacher might pick something the student might not like or something they cant get supplies for. They would also probaly love to be told they have a project to do over the summer if it was their design and get it done. So overall students should be allowed to design their own projects so they can learn more in the summer.\u00a0  If someone were to make it a priority for all students to participate in an extracurricular activity, it would be extremely recommended for the person to make the activity choices an exceptionally wide variety, so that it is more likely for students to find the things they enjoy to do. With the exception of making sure that there would be an activity to match each students interest, the idea would not be too bad. But in the same breath, that'd require some type of survey or application of some type, that every student must take in order to find out their interests, so that way making the activities wont be as difficult. Although keep in mind, that not every student may want to participate regardless of whether or not there is an activity they might enjoy.   Overall, there are many benefits to participating in extracurricular activities. You get to do something you enjoy, you get to meet new people, you'll be happier, and although people may find ways to argue against the new requirements, the good outweighs the bad. There are plenty of options at most schools so that everyone can find something that they enjoy. There are plenty of different sports, there are debate clubs, the student council, yearbook committee, the school newspaper, theatre, and clubs for almost any interest someone may have. In conclusion, I agree fully with the principal's new decision and I believe that everyone should participate in some type of extracurricular as well.  Students should be allowed to explore their interests on their own, as opposed to being forced to participate in something they barely have any connection with. The best way for a student to succeed is to build upon something they already have skills or an interest in, and the activities that the school promote do not cater to each individual student. This new rule promotes involuntary participation and will possibly make teenagers resilient to exploring their interests and values.  One tactic that students will typically use with summer projects like reading a book of their choice and filling out the same chart is to read the same book as a friend and then copy each other\u00a0answers when they have to turn the project in. If students design their own project, they'll have to show some individuality and creativity on the due date. Teachers will have an easier time telling when students copy each other\u00a0because if done right, no student should have created the same project. If two students are caught clearly copying off each other\u00a0on a project meant for individuality, they can be punished accordingly. Everyone will turn something different in at least some way when they aren't spoon fed\u00a0a big packet and instead get to create their own packet. ",

This is process has been around for decades, but things have changed.  The Electoral College is a method of voting for President and Vice President that was produced by our founding fathers in the articles of the Constitution. The Electoral College has been in use for centuries, but it is time that we disregard it.  As said in the article, \"What Is The Electoral College?\", \"The Electoral College process consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for President and Vice President, and the counting of the electoral votes by Congress.\" That is a huge amount of work but that is what keeps the elections well organized. Each candidate running for President in a state has their own group of electors. After each election, the governor of your state prepares a certificate presenting all of the candidates that ran for your state. As stated in the article by the Office of the Federal Register, \"The Certificate of Ascertainment also declares the winning presidential candidate in your state and shows which electors will represent your state at the meeting of the electors in December of the election year.\" The Electoral College is what mantains everything professional.  The Electoral College has served us for more than a century in determining our nation's new president. \"The Electoral College process consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for President and Vice President, and the counting of the electoral votes by Congress,\" states the article \"What Is the Electoral College?\" written by the Office of the Federal Register. This means that we do not vote directly vote for our new president, but instead vote for electors that vote for a candidate running for office. Though many individuals are in favor of keeping the Electoral College, if kept, it will continue to cause problems in our nation.  What is the electoral college?\u00a0 The electoral college is a process which consists of the selection of the electors, meeting where they vote for president, and the counting of the votes.\u00a0 The real question is, is the electoral college helping us or is it just bringing our government farther towards disaster?  The Electoral College is a process where voters select electors who then vote for the President of the United State. But is it really that reliable? Is it better than an election decided by that of popular vote.   In  What is the Electoral College?  it states that, \"The Electoral College consists of 538 electors. A majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the president.\" The popular vote can get tied up pretty easily, but it is a lot harder for the electoral votes to get tied up because only 270 votes are needed to elect the president.  In order to understand the flaws in the electoral college, you need to know what the electoral college is, and how it came to be. \"The Electoral College process consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for President and Vice President, and the counting of the electoral votes by Congress.\" (Office of the Federal Register 2). This system was created by the founding fathers as a compromise between the congressional vote and the popular vote. However there was a reason for this new, seperated voting system. During their time the founding fathers where among the most educated men in the country. Back then education was not standard and very few people could read or write. The founding fathers did not want uneducated citizens voting on the individual who would lead the country. So they created a system where the uneducated would vote for a group of educated men, who would in turn vote on a president. Thus the electoral college was born.  When the Constitution of the United States was written our founding fathers decided on an Electoral College as the way to ellect the president instead of a direct vote. The Electoral College is a process that makes a compromise between the popular vote of the citizens and the Congressional vote. When citizens vote for president they are actually voting for a member of the Electoral College that is going to select their president, rather than the citizens voting for the president themselves. The Electoral College is made of 538 electors, the number of electors from each state varies depending on the states Congressional delegation. Washington D.C. is counted as a state for this process and alloted only three electors.  The Electoral College process allows citizens to vote for an elector in their state whom they believe will choose their prefered president. If the elector of their choice wins the statewide election with 87 votes, the elector votes for their prefered president along with the 87 votes. As stated in source 2 \"Can voters control whom their electors vote for? Not always.\" ",

                "content": "In the text it says, \" Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere. On the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet.\" In addition, the article also states, \"Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system, even though Mercury is closer to our sun.\" The conditions on that planet Venus are much worse than on Eath, the planet contains such heat that it is over 800 degrees Fahrenheit.   Venus may have one of the harshest climates in our solar system, with an average temperature of 800 degrees Farenheit, and an atmospheric pressure 90 times greater than Earth's. Despite these major differences, it is also believed to be the closest to Earth by means of geological similarity. As stated in the article, scientists believe that Venus was most likely covered with oceans and quite possibly could have even hosted life. This idea is gathered from the similarities in structures between Earth and that volcano of a planet, like valleys, mountains, and an atmosphere.  These are all questions that need to be considered when brainstoming the idea of visitng another planet. The author of this article is avoiding all of these mainstream problems by simply saying it's worth the risks, when it actaully is not. In paragraph 3, the author explains all of the dangers of Venus and how they can affect humans. He explains, \" On the planet's surface, the temperature averages over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet.\" Considering that this is true, we can definitrly assume that condition on Venus are severly dangerous, and a lot of people may get hurt trying to explore it. The aurthor also states, \" These conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth; such an environment would crush even a submarine accustomed to diving to the deepest parts of our oeans and would liquefy many metals. What the author is stating here is that not even our strongest materials and creations can withstand the conditions on Venus. This means that in order to explore Venus we have to design all new machinery, which would cost a lot of money, not to mention the human costs as we would need humans to test things out. He also makes it notable that venus has the hottest surface of any planet, despite not being the closest to the sun. All of these facts are serious concerns when regarding human safety as well as propr functioning of machines. Even if exploring Venus was a possibilty, would it be even be worth it after all of he human costs and money costs or paid. What we are discussing here is putting human lives at risk, and spending a ton of money on a project that is no where near being ready ready to present. These reasons as well as the provided facts assure me on my claim that the author did a terrible job of supporting this idea of exploration.  Paragraph 3 of the article is all about the extreme environment that Venus presents. Venus has temperatures over 800 degress Fahrenheit, an atmospheric pressure 90 times greater than that on Earth, erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and other obstacles that prove challenging for scientists to overcome. Additionally, Venus has clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in the atmosphere which prove to be challenging to scientists. These dangers may seem impossible to overcome, but scientists have been developing new methods to further their knowledge of Venus.   Well, first of all, The atmospere of Venus has a THICK layer of carbon dioxide the covers 98% of the planet, in which makes Everything a much hoter place,but, to top it of with the atmosphere problem, the clouds in there have highly corrosive sulfuric acid. If we some how passes through the atmosphere, than we'll face ANOTHER problem with the ground. Since Venus is the second planet from our sun and with all those carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, the surface ground temperature is over 800 DEGREES FAHRENHEIT. In which with the surface and the atmosphere, it could basically melt many types of metal with no problem. Another Problem is that the atmosphereic preassure is 90x greater than our Earth, with that much preassure could easily crushed a submarine that is built to surrvive the deeper end of the ocean. From what we gather small information from our space craft, the geology of venus pretty much have erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lighting strikes.  Venus has a temperature that humans can not survive in, 800 degrees Fahrenheit. Also on Venus the pressure is 90 times what humans experience on Earth. Humans have never experienced conditions as extreme as those on Venus: \"Even a submarine accustomed to diving to the deepest parts of [the] oceans\" would be crushed and the high temperatures \"would liquefy many metals.\" Something that was made to be able to go withstand high pressures, like a submarine, would be crushed on Venus, and metals can withstand very high temperatures but on venus they would liqeufy. It is unsafe and humanly impossible for humans to try to explore the land of Venus when some of the best technology can not even withstand the climate of Venus.  The next problem that Earth faces in studying Venus is that temperatures on this planet exceed 800 degrees Fahrenheit, a temperature found nowhere on Earth  The author writes \" on the planets surface tempatures average over 800 degrees fahrenheit.\" You cant even walk on the surface without burning up, how is this like Earth? The author also mentions,\" Venus was probaly covered largely with oceans.\" All those oceans that may have been their are gone now. Why would we explore a destroyed Earth?  Venus is a challenge to get to with its hot surface, with its thick atmosphere, and atmospheric pressure. But scientists and astronomers are facinated by Venus, because they believe it had oceans and could have supported various forms of life.  The author goes on to list the physical dangers of Venus: \"On the planet\u0092s surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet\" (The Challenge 3). On Venus, the temperature alone could liquify many metals and completely destroy spacecrafts that were sent there. Also, the pressure of the atmosphere could crush a submarine fit for diving to the deepest parts of the ocean. ",

The advocates of this position are correct in arguing that the Electoral College method is not democratic in a modern sense . . . it is the electors who elect the president, not the people.\"  Most people hear the word \"Electoral College\" and think that it is a place.. But they're wrong, it is a process. The Electoral College is widely regarded as a thing that seems to belong to the past and not to fit in the present. The advocates whom are conflicting with others are saying that the Electoral College method isn't democratic in modern day society, which is correct. The Electoral College is a compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens which was founded by the founding fathers.  This makes the Electoral College not a democratic method for electing the president. This nation was founded on the belief of democracy, so when the government ignores the call for a democratic method for elections it is disrespectful towards out Founding Fathers, and especially to the citizens of the United States of America. Furthermore, state representatives may misrepresent a state, possibly by defiance. This has happened in the 2000 campaign where segregationalists defied the people and nearly succeeded in replacing the electors for those who opposed Josh F. Kennedy.  The electoral college imposes on the American freedom and right to choose their president. The United States of America is a representative democracy. The citizens choose who they want to lead but those votes aren't truly their own votes. According to Richard A. Posner of source 3, \"...the Electoral College method is not democratic in a modern sense...it is the electors who elect the president, not the people. When you vote for a presidental candidate, you're actually voting for a slate of electors.\" American citizen votes do not matter as much as we think they should. The founding fathers built this country for the people. The people should have an actual voice in who they want to lead this great nation. In addition, Americans should have a direct say. Votes should go straight to the president and not the party's electors. This is not only fair to citizens but also a more relible plan. Bradford Plumer of source 2 explains to us that \"\"faithless\" electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please...\" We can't depend on these electors to determine one of the most important things of this country. We can't depend on these \"faithless\" electors to vote who we want when they might do the opposite. Voting by popular vote prevents these mishaps and restores our democracy.  In Source 3 Posner states, \"it is the electors who elect the president, not the people\". Ever since the United States has been around our lifestyle has been purely democratic. The people are supposed to the empowering body of our government and their voice is the one that should be heard. But since we have the Electoral College the voice of the people has become muffled. No longer is the presidential election a democratic event, but one that is decided through the votes of only a few chosen American citizens. Plumer observed in Source 2 that, \"During the 2000 campaign, 17 states didn't see the canidates at all\". If the people of America are truly part of our governing body then they must see the canidates and hear what they have to say. The Electoral College has driven canidates away from states that will not have much say. These states are then left to make a decision for themselves and decide based on their personal preference, they are never able to truly hear what these canidates may or may not have to offer.  \"Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president.\" (Bradford Plumer). The public is starting to not like that their vote is not directly going toward the presidential vote but towards a group of electors that decide the fate of the presidency. \"the Electoral College method is not emocratic in a modern sense.\" (Richard A Posner). The public is also starting to feel that this is not a true Democracy with this system. \"Consider that state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors, and that those electors could always defy the will of the people.\" (Bradford Plumer). The public is starting to not like that feeling that the electors can just turn on the public and not vote for what some people want (and it has happened a few times in the past). \"'faithless' electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please.\" (Bradford Plumer). That is another worry of the public, no matter what party the elector belongs to, they can vote for anyone they want. \"Perhaps most worrying is the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote. In that case, the elcetion would be thrown to the House of Representatives, where state delegations vote on the president.\"(Bradford Plumer). The people are also not liking the fact that an elector representing a small amount of people has as much to say as an elector representing millions of people. All and all, it is hard to deny that there are a few problems with the electoral college and that this causes the public to worry come election time.  Paragraph 15 says \"The Electoral College is widely regarded as an anachronism, a non-democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be overruled by declaring the candidate who recieves the most popular votes the winner.  The Electoral College is widely regarded as an anachronism, a non-democratic method of selecting a president that needs to be overruled by declaring the canidate who receives the most popular votes the winner. I personally think that is the best way to decide who gets in.  In conclusion, the electoral college is ineffective and outdated. we should no longer use this as a system of defining our president. Even though a winner is often more clear, there is still a possibility of a tie between candidates. People who support the Electoral College also argue that its a good thing due to swing states having more attention payed to them and therefore being more careful in their decision. However, this reasoning is flawed in that it assumes that citizens of a state are more likely to inform theirselves thouroughly simply because their vote holds more value, in a sense. Also, candidates would no longer pay special attention to swing states if the electoral college weren't in place so the votes of these citizens wouldn't be held above the rest. Increased value of votes is not a good thing, which this argument also assume. It is the best decision to abolish the Electoral College.   ",

                "content": "In conclusion, I told you it would be a good thing for the kids so they are not at home watching television and playing video games all day! Then i also told you there are plenty of things to do outside for the environment! Finally i told you it would be good for kids to help out with the outside world, not just in school! I no it'll take time away from school, and we need our education but if you think about it kids may want to help out, some might just be to afraid to say something!  Some kids go home and play sports outside or play a game with their siblings, but most kids go home and play video games for 5 hours till they have to eat dinner or go to bed. This is very unhealthy. An extracurricular activity would get a person who usually plays lots of video games to do something active. They could play sports after school and they would still have time for video games. Playing sports after school could convince them to play sports for fun, not because they have to do something after school and they could join a league and exercise more than just after school. This would help kids stay active and healthy. After school activities for all people is a good idea because it would help kids stay active and healthy.  It can help you learn about how its a good thing to do and also spend some of your day outside in the fresh air. If one day your stuck at home and need something to do you should go outside and do some community service it makes your day less boring and you get to get out of your house for a little while and do something good.  one of the best stress relieving thing you can do is to exercise, but most people don't like to exercise because they don't think its fun. But if you exercise with friends, then it can be really fun, because generally everything you do with friends is more fun than doing anything alone. So by joining a sports team you get to relieve your stress, by exercising and you get to have fun with some friends. Also if you happen to be super talented when it comes to your sport you could even get offers to play college and you could potentially even receive scholarships. But if you want to receive good scholarships you must also be a good student, now generally most schools offer tutoring or homework clubs which can be very helpful if you want to improve your grades. So in general after curricular\u00a0activities can help improve your grades and can help you feel more relaxed.  For example, you could go to a animal shelter and help walk and feed the animals. Or you could go to a nursing home and play games with the seniors there. I'm sure they would also love to have someone sit and just listen to them tell a story or two. There are lots of fun ways to help out that don't include getting dirty or being outside.  Obesity and depression can both be linked to overworking students and not giving them enough time to go do something else. This is why schools need extracurricular activities. Sports and music are both helpful in this way. At a young age, many children are encouraged to go outside and participate in their local sports team by their parents. The parents do this so the children can get exercise and grow up leading a healthier lifestyle which combines academics and physical activity. Team sports, like soccer, football, or basketball, also teach students about teamwork and build up their self-confidence, which benefits their mental health as well. Team members meet each other just about every week, and over time, this relationship builds into a friendship. Individuals can feel that they belong in the team and treat almost like a second family. This sense of belonging benefits their mental health, which in turn benefits their performance in the classroom, which benefits their life overall.  If a student is playing a sport it will help him/her get outside and get fresh air after hours of being stuck inside school.  Loosing a sports game does not\u00a0feel good but its something every one has experienced. Although not everyone knows how to handle losing. When you are taught from a young age how to be resilient and bounce back from a lose, it will be much easier to handle those losses as an adult. Playing a sport also requires team work, you have to work with your team to score a goal. Learning how to communicate with your team mates is very similar to communication in the work place.  What better way to relax then do something you enjoy with other people that enjoy it as well. Playing a sport after school can help you create close friends and teammates. When you think about stress reliving one of things you might think of is one of your favorite things to do with some of your friends. Well guess what, you just explained what a club is. In that portion of your day you don't have to worry about acing that test all you have to think about is swishing that three or winning that chess match.   These students need to be prepared for college and the real world outside of school, such as the work force. For example, if a child wanted to play soccer you would not just sit them in front of a television and watch soccer games. This might be a good way to teach them the general idea of what soccer is but they will never be able to learn the skills that are necessary in the game. That child will never learn how to pass, shoot, kick, or even have the social skills to communicate with his team mates. This goes the same for any other activity. The teachers in this school are treating there students just like this child. If they just give them the summer project and tell them to complete it they will never learn the skills of self-management and creativity that they would develop while design their own summer projects. These are valuable skills that students will need later in their own life time. ",

If we were to switch the way things are now, that would not happen.\u00a0 A poll taken in 2000 called the Gallup poll, showed that over 60% of voters prefered a direct election rather then the kind we have now.\u00a0 This took place when Al Gore recieved the popular vote, but lost the electoral votes.\u00a0 You can see that the current system has its flaws.   In paragraph nine,\u00a0 the text says, \"... according to a Gallup poll in 2000, taken shortly after Al Gore- thanks to the quirks of the electoral college- won the popular vote but lost presidency, over 60 percent of voters\u00a0 would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now.\" The electoral college is responsible for picking electors, who can go behind the peoples back and chose the president nobody wanted. This system or process is a total disaster. Paragraph thirteen states, \"At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winner-take-all system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the 'swing' states.  In this system, according to the second source, popular vote, which is what the majority people select, most of the time loses the election due to the Electoral System. An Example used in this source was the 2000 election with Al Gore, he had won the popular vote, but had lost the election thanks to the Electoral College. With this system in play, voters cannot control who they want to vote for and that is not how it should be. In source one, it clearly states most states have a \"winner-take-all\" type of system that awards all electors of that state to the specific candidate, which is the complete opposite of benefiting the people, because not everyone in that state wants to vote for that specific candidate. Source 3 says big states that a larger state gets more attention than a smaller state does because of the amount of votes, however some states claim they never even got to see a presidential campaign had because of how small the states was. Its is Unfair to these states which include Rhode Island, South Carolina. It takes away opportunities from these smaller states.  In the electoral college voters aren't essentially voting for a president but they are voting for a group of electors who will then elect a president. The electors can be picked in many different ways. Sometimes they are they are picked at state conventions, they can be picked at state party's central committe, or sometimes the presidental canidate picks them themselves according to Bradford Plumer (source 2).  A lot of voters who are not very well educated may not even understand what the electoral college is or what they are actually voting for when they vote. Instead of voting for the candidate that they want as the next president, they are voting for a group of electors that decide who will win. Sometimes, the electors that are assigned to that candiadate will not vote for them. This process also seems to disriciminate against the less populated states because they don't have as much a say in the college and are often forgoten in the rush of propaganda and aren't really aware of who they should pick and why they should pick them.  The electoral college's biggest flaw may perhaps be its ability to elect a president that doesn't even appeal to half of the country  The Electoral College also aviods the problem of election in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast. Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992 are good examples, they both only a had 43 percent plurality of the popular votes. Some potential voters who have no hope have less in centive to pay attention to the campaign than they would have if the president were picked by popular votes.  The popular vote is a clear statement of voters' opinions and is virtually unable to be tampered with. On the other hand, the Electoral College only complicates the situation by introducing a middle man who is prone to bribery and mistakes. Why should we allow candidates to win because of the electoral vote if they do not recieve the overall approval of the public? Compare the opinions of 538 electors to the opinions of hundreds of millions of voters. Evidently, the opinions of all these voters cannot be properly represented by these 538 electors. It's just impossible both logistically and logically.  Some might argue that the Electoral College is flawed because electors can choose not to vote for their canidate. It is true that this has happened in the past,  The U.S government lets people choose these electors so they feel important in the choices our country makes. We take time to study our favorite candidates, and if the electoral college does not agree with them, they are pushed to the side. What happens to the people who did not vote for the, \"right\" candidate? They are forever unheard. Sentenced to live in a community where they are silcenced. I do not agree with the electoral college because agree with our fore father Abraham Lincoln. He said this was supposed to be a country of the people, by the people, and for the people.  ",

The author was able to support his idea throught the use of NASA and it's research. The passage continues to come up with a plan on the best way to float above Venus when the author says, \"At thirty-plus miles above the surface, temperatures would still be toasty at around 170 degrees Fahrenheit, but the air pressure would be close to that of sea level on Earth.\" This factual evidence that is included ensures that the author is supporting this idea to the fullest of his potential. Researched and factual evidence that is provided all throughout the passage shows how the author supports this idea thoroughly and well.  The author says NASA has an idea on how to send humans to study Venus, \"...possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray\" (Paragraph 5). The ship would hover above, avoiding the dangerous conditions by remaining away from it. Allowing the scientists to be close enough to study some elements of Venus, and to have more context on how to understand it more, without a human possibly dying. To further support this, the author states, \"...hovering safely far above the planet can provide only limited insight...\" (Paragrah 6). The author is aware that hovering is not the most effectove technique, but he supports the idea by hinting it will still be worth it because information can still be gathered, despite the limits.  The author states, \"NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray.\". Stating ways that Venus can be studied with people not being put in danger helps get the authors point across. The article also touches on how floating above the surface could keep those studying the planet safe. Temperatures would still be high, but nothing the spacecraft couldn't handle, the air pressure would be like how it is on Earth at sea level, soloar power would be bountiful, and radiation would be no higher than the levels on Earth. The text then states, \"Not easy conditions, but survivable for humans.\". Although this would not be an easy job, it is possible to study Venus safely. The details used in this paragraph help convey the authors point that studying Venus can be done safely and that it should continue to happen.  From the example stated earlier, regaurding the extreme conditions in Venus, the author was able to provide a logical solution to the weather without using any opinions. The author wrote,\"NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow sceintists to float above the fray.\" The author then goes onto describe NASA's plan in full depth, and going into fine detail about the floating contraption that would suspend the astronauts safely above the harsh atmosphere of Venus. They then state, \"Not easy conditions, but survivable for humans.\" The author is displaying a solution for the conditions, and even the minor flaws it has. The author going into detail about the solution for the extreme conditions in Venus and even conceding a bit when saying, \"Not easy conditions but survivable for humans,\" helps argue their point. They affectively refuted the counter-arguements by using factual evidence in their rebutal, and deemed themselves trustworthy by the opposing side by even conceding slightly on a few issues.  This, in turn, aids in convincing readers that might have originally disgareed with the author due to the fact that Venus' \"conditions are fare more extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth; such an environment would crush even a submarine assustomed to diving to the deepest parts of our oceans and would liquefy many metals,\" (3). The author, after making this counterclaim, refutes it by talking of some solutions to this ever-looming issue: \"NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions of the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray. Imagine a blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the roiling Venusian landscape,\" (5). The author talks of how the air pressure, temperature and radiation would all be survivable for humans. Some, such as the air pressure 30 miles above Venus, would be almost identical to Earth at sea level.  When discussing the exploration of Venus, most people are turned off by its reputation as a dangerous and challenging planet for humans to study. While the author doesn't stray away from these harsh extremities, they make sure to prove how these details seem insignificant and how safe travel can still be executed. The author thoroughly describes the plan provided by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) to allow astronauts to float above the fray and avoid the hazardous conditions. They provide specific qualities of the plan, such as the air pressure being close to the sea level on Earth, the abundance of solar power, and the containment of radiation, to prove how humans would be kept in a safe atmosphere. They even provide a real world connection between NASA's possible solution and a blimp-like vheicle hovering around the ground to make it easier for the audience to understand. The author combats the speculaiton of Venus being too dangerous to explore in order to further support the idea of it being a worthy pursuit.  They are considering a blimp-like vehicle that would float above the suface of Venus to meet the challenges presented. This blimp would avoid the poor conditions of the Venusian landscape by floating some thirty miles above the surface. Conditions around the blimp would still be slightly hot, but the pressure and toxicity would be similar to that on Earth. These conditions are not ideal, but they would be sufficient enough to study Venus further. Another one of NASA's ideas is to use mechanical computers to study Venus. These mechanical computers do not require electronics, and they would be more resistant to the poor conditions of the surface. These new innovations in the study of Venus is what makes the dangers tolerable and the study worthy.  This furthers the point more that NASA is also trying to send humans to go visit and study our planet's \"twin\". The author then goes on, proceeding to help our visualization of NASA's plan, telling the reader that NASA would not directly put humans on Venus's surface, but rather have them float in a blimp-like vehicle above the startpoint of Venus's weather and \"avoid the unfriendly ground conditions by staying up ad out of their way.\" The author lastly pointed out how, even with the toasty weather, Venus' surface is still survivable for humans, even though it's not full of easy conditions.  The second issue is safety. According to NASA, they have a solution for getting a spaceship to Venus carefully and safely. \"Imagine a blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the roiling Venusian landscape. Just as our jet airplanes travel at a higher altitude to fly over many storms, a vehicle hovering over Venus would avoid the unfriendly ground conditions by staying up and out of their way. At thirty-plus miles above the surface, temperatures would still be toasty at around 170 degrees Fahrenheit, but the air pressure would be close to that of sea level on Earth. Solar power would be plentiful, and radiation would not exceed Earth levels. Not easy conditions, but survivable for humans.\" (paragraph 5). NASA has a soultion for the safety issue that was recently brought to their attention. The people who want to go and explore Venus now believe that this is one of the final steps toward actually getting off of the ground. If NASA trains astronauts well enough, tries to simulate the conditions on Venus, and everything works well; there is noting holding them back.  According to the author, \"Venusian geolegy and weather present additional impediments like erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lighting strikes to probes...\" He later stated that NASA has a possible idea to send blimp-like vehicles to travel the surface of Venus, but that would not provide a detailed enough view of the ground. In order to get his point across to the audience, he should not have kept going agianst information ",

                "content": "In conclusion, don't operate a vehicle while using a phone at the same time because it can lead to some serious consequences. You are not only endangering yourself but your endangering others on the road, as well as passengers, or even any close-by pedestrians. Driving needs complete attention and focus so ensure the risk of any injuries or deaths because driving is very dangerous. Using a cell phone takes away your focus and attention from driving because now you're trying to multi-task which means you're playing with life or lives. Speaking from experience, cell phones should be banned while driving because they slow your reaction time to anything that may be happening around you. Managing a cell phone while driving is now putting you in a life or death situation that you wouldn't want to be put in.    The use of a mobile device should not be allowed while driving a vehicle. Some states are moving to make it illegal. The accidents cause high financial damage which supports the reasoning of the states to make it illegal. The many deaths, physical injuries and emotional strain that if inficts far outweighs any possible need for using a phone. The final reason that states are making it illegal to drive distracted is because of the high amount of crashes that it causes. It is because of all these factors that the use of mobile devices while behind the wheel of any vehicle should be completely and utterly prohibited.  Even the act of just dialing a cell phone can be dangerous. This increases the crash risk by 3 times. This is one of the worst distractions drivers can have, Due to the fact that you are not paying attention to the road. The driver's hands are not on the steering wheel which causes you to lose control of your car. This increases the accident risk highly. This is only one reason why cell phone use while driving should be illegal.  In mosts states it is illegal to even have your cell phone in your hand let alone be using it or talking on the phone while driving. If the law is not enough to persuade people to stop using phones while driving, the dangers of killing people should. Close to five thousand people died due to cell phone related crashes in 2018 (Texting and Driving Statistics 2019, thezebra. com). Even if someone is not on the phone themselves, someone else on the road could be  You've probably seen someone text and drive. In the few seconds they take to glance away from the road and at their phones, a car crash could happen. It only takes one second for your car to swerve into the other lane. Phones should never be used while driving for many reasons, and the main reason being that it is extremely dangerous. Texting and driving makes you 23% more likely to get in an accident. It's so much smarter to wait until you've reached your destination to use your phone. If you can't wait, you can pull over on the side of the road. If not, you could greatly risk your life.  Driving while operating your phone can end in a very horrific way and has for a number of young adults. The number one killer of young adults is motor vehicle crashes. This is a major issue in the United States and it is shown because a law was made to prevent operating a phone and driving. For example, there are billboards everywhere saying no texting and driving and commercials saying the same. Texting and driving may seem tempting to do, but every year thousands of drivers and passengers are killed due to someone being on their phone and driving. It only takes a couple of seconds for you to take your eyes off the road and someone can swerve in your lane or you swerve in someone else's lane and didn't notice because you are texting someone back or looking at a notification.  In conclusion, it's hard to imagine why anyone would think using a phone while driving is a good idea. Nothing good can come from texting or talking on the phone behind the wheel. The best decision anyone can make is to completely forget about their phones while driving and focus on the road. You risk so many things by using your phone while operating a vehicle.. You risk your life, your friends life, strangers lives, and even the money in your pocket. The only exception to being on a phone while driving should be to report an emergency. Otherwise, the use of a cell phone is risky and should be completely banned all over the world. Statistics alone should be enough to open people's eyes to the dangers of using their phone in the car. Phones are distracting and without a doubt should not be used while operating a vehicle.  Drivers should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while driving because in a matter of seconds you, your family or someone else's life could be put in danger or worse, taken away.   One reason as to why people should not be able to use their phone while driving is because the risk of death is so high  The use of a mobile device while operating a vehicle should be prohibited. Now is the time to admit that driving while using a phone or any mobile devices is dangerous! You wouldn't want you or a loved one to end up critically injured, dead or disabled. Phone usage while driving is one of the many reasons accidents happen everyday. You can always wait until you are out of the car to make that call or answer that text !   ",

Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth\" (The Challenge of Exploring Venus). If Venus could've supported human life long ago, it is likely the planet still can. The scientific facts throughout this statement support the author's claim by having a reliable source of information, supporting the idea. Paragraph 4 reads, \"Today, Venus still has some features that are analogous to those on Earth. The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters\" (The Challenge of Exploring Venus). Venus already has Earth-like landscapes and other similar formations. This supports the author's idea of exploring Venus because it is so similar to Earth, the chances of survival are higher than any other planet.  In summary, we should continue studying the planet Venus despite the dangers because if anything were to happen to our planet, Earth, Venus would be the closest planet we could go to, we could learn more about Venus and the planet's harsh conditions, and because Venus is most like Earth and had the ability to support life. Furthering our research on Venus can only benefit us, so lets stop worrying about the dangers and get out and explore our planetary neighbor.  He states that Venus is often referred to as Earth's \"twin\". This is because Venus and Earth are close in size, density, and at some points in orbit are the closest planets in the solar system. It is also believed that at one point, Venus was a lot like Earth is now. \"The Challenge of Exploring Venus\" states, \"Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our soloar system.\". The article goes on to say Venus most likely had large oceans that supported life, and the planet has things like craters, valleys, and mountains that we also have here on Earth. The author including these details helps get the point across that Venus is a lot like Earth, and with the little research been done already, we've found so much. This helps readers understand that the longer Venus is studied, the more we will learn about it.  People are facinated with the Man on the Moon and the idea of Martians, but most people do not think about life on Venus. Venus is the second planet from the sun and shares many geographical features with Earth. However, studying this planet is made difficult by the dense and toxic atmosphere, high temperatures, and violent weather. Despite this, some people think that Venus should still be explored, and the author of \"The Challenge of Exploring Venus\" is of this opinion.  When explaining past explorations to Venus, the author states, \"Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth.\" Facts that have been presented that occured in the past help the author support his idea that there is reasons why people should look into further studying Venus. These past facts present the idea that Venus once looked like Earth did, and if that is true, there are reasons why it should be looked into further.  Venus used to be covered in oceans and supported life. Additionally, Venus still has features that are similar to Earth's such as a rocky sediment with valleys, mountains, and craters. Insight into the Venusian landscape would further allow astronomers to determine how closely related Earth and Venus were. The author also states that humans should not be limited by their fear to go out and explore. In the final paragraph of the article, the author describes how human curiosity will lead humans into many intimidating expidentures. However, the author believes that travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited simply due to danger, and humans should travel as far as their innovation will take them.  The author is for the exploration of Venus, but consistently chooses to bring up the problems that doing so faces. The author writes about the difficulties about exploring Venus, because of the planet's extreme environment. They opposed their own side in paragraph three by saying, \"These conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth; such an environment would crush even a submarine accustomed to diving to the deepest parts of our oceans and would liquefy many metals.\" This is an affective strategy, because people who may oppose exploration to Venus may say something similar to this. The author is arguing their own point to establish reliability and trust amongst with people who favor not exploring Venus. The author showing that they see the problems with exploring Venus shows that they are open minded and open to their mind being changed, and this will in turn have the reader do the same.  Exploring Venus would a beinificail and woth while scientific endver. Over the years Venus has been a topic of study due to its earth like qualites. The temperature of Venus is not as freindly to humans as our own atmosphereVenus is one the closest planets to own planet than most others. Lastly, the exploration of venus can be the next ground breaking scientific discovery yet.  In conclusion the reasons for exploring Venus include how close it is to the sun, how similar it is to Earth, and how it could have supported life forms long ago. Yes, it is very dangerest because of high temperature and pressure. But if we come up with a way to lower the temperature and pressure it will be surely worth the work put in. These reason are way we should try to visit Venus in the future.  The author also states that \"Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth.\". This shows the readers that Venus is worth studying because there may have been life on this planet. Therefore, NASA needs to send researchers to Venus to identify if there is life or not. The author gives another example by referencing Earth-like features to show that thesremay be some form of life or a way of nature, these references include Venus having mountains, valleys, and craters. This validates the authors point well. ",

Let's say the options the school provides are all not of interest to them, so they're forced to take something they don't want to do. How would you like to be forced to commit to something you didn't want to do to start with? I'm pretty sure no one would want that. Though extracurricular activities are great for students to do, some are just reserved and are shy when having to do things in front of people. For students with anxiety, that is extremely embarrassing. Plus, if you force someone to do something they don't want to do, they'll just do it with half-effort and that makes everything one step harder for the people who actually wanted to do that activity. I can almost guarantee that this will happen if schools force students to do this, and it'll just make the activities less fun for the ones who actually want to do it.  Everyone in life has been forced to do something that he or she does not want to do. No matter how hard the individual tried to get out of it, the individual still had to go through with the assignment. To complete the assignment, he or she will have to give up something. For example, if someone was forced to come in to work on a day off, he or she may have to give up spending time with family. Being forced to do something is never a fun experience.  It's always best to give students options, and letting them enjoy what they do best at, but it's not right\u00a0to force them into doing what they don't want to do; yes I agree that after school activities should be in school, and open to all students.  Don't force students into something they don't feel comfortable\u00a0with, but recommend it to them so they can think about it.  I think it shouldn't be required because when students are required to do something they usually don't want to do it  we should really be doing things that can help ourselves and do community service whenever we want. Because if you force someone to do something, we wont like it.  because some kids have important things that they have to do, not want to do, have to do  Its easy to do because you don't have to count\u00a0 them up yourself.

The idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers is supported through Venus' vast similarites to Earth, which is why humans have such interest in this particular planet. The idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the presented dangers is conveyed through Venus' proximity. The idea that Venus is a worthy pursuit despite its hostile environment is supported through the innovation in machines that could make the close-up exploration of Venus possible. The author believes that sometimes humans cannot let curiosity, imagination, and innovation be trampled by the dangers and doubts. Humans cannot live in fear all the time. The human spirit always demands that humans continue striving towards knowing more.    Therefore, the author supports his idea, \"that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents,\" by giving us multiple reasons why we need the knowlage, how it affects us and how we will accomplish that. First, by telling us that Venus is like our twin planet and learning what happened we could adapt. Secondly, by showing us that we are can prevent our own downfall. Lastly, the author tells us how NASA expects to pull this off.  In conclusion, the claim about Venus being a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents that the author of \"The Challenges of Exploring Venus\" states is well supported by facts and perfectly thought out ideas. Although Venus is an extremely dangerous planet packed with many reasons as to why exploration is currently held back, NASA is still looking for ways to be able to gain more valuable insight about the Evening Star. Just like the author said, learning and travelling should not be limited by doubts, and scientists will not let doubts and fears stop them.   First, the author brings up his topic of \" Studying Venus is a worhty pursuit despite the dangers it presents\". Despite this, the author only gave one full paragraph, out of the eight he wrote, on why humans would want to explore the planet ; he then preceeded to go onto the dangers of Venus, rather than why it is worth exploring.  In \"The Challenge of Exploring Venus,\" the author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit depsite the dangers it presents. The author uses strong details to support this claim throughout the article. Facts and statistics by NASA and other reliable sources are used to back the claims. The author stands by the opinion that Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents.  The idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers is supported through Venus' vast similarites to Earth, which is why humans have such interest in this particular planet.  The idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the presented dangers is supported through Venus' proximity. The author conveys the usefulness of having Venus so close,  The idea that Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it brings is supported through the innovation in machines that could make the close-up exploration of Venus possible.  The author very well supports the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers. They are very pasionate about the idea because they provide lots of facts and reasoning to further support the claim.  In coclusion, the authors final claim states, \"Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation.\" Although there are many dangers that could seek upon them, they take them as \"challenges\" and are willing to dig deeper to find out why Venus is the way it is. \"Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth- like planet in our solar system.\" Therefore, this is why the author does a good job by suggesting that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents.

                "content": "If a driver is using their cell phone, it means that their visual focus has become divided and the potential for an accident is greatly increased.  When paying attention to your cell phone it takes away the attention you need to focus on the road and drive safely. In a text on www.wikepedia.com it says \" Using a cell phone while driving increases the driver's risk of causing a crash. Drivers are distracted, decreasing the driver's awareness on the road, leading to more car crashes.\" This simply means that the use of the cell phone while driving can result in a dangerous outcome. It is also said that \"4.6 secondspass when a driver's eyes leave the road to text at 55mph, it's like driving the length of a football field blind.\" When a driver's eye is taken off the road the chance of wrecking another car or even running off the side of the road and harming yourself. The dangerous outcomes could be losing control of the wheel, crashing, running off the side of the road, harming others of all ages, running into objects ( poles, signs,cines,etc.), and the worst of all, death. Cell phone disturbance can be very dangerous when driving which is another cell phone should not be used while driving.  While driving, cell phones divert a driver's visual focus from the road to the screen of the mobile device which is very dangerous. The driver isn't able to see what's in front of them because their eyes are locked in on the screen of a cell phone which can possibly lead to a variety of negative outcomes. Texting while driving can lead to harm to health, government involvement, and vehicular harm.'  No one, not even the most skilled driver in the world should be able to use a cell phone in any way while driving.   In conclusion, don't operate a vehicle while using a phone at the same time because it can lead to some serious consequences. You are not only endangering yourself but your endangering others on the road, as well as passengers, or even any close-by pedestrians. Driving needs complete attention and focus so ensure the risk of any injuries or deaths because driving is very dangerous. Using a cell phone takes away your focus and attention from driving because now you're trying to multi-task which means you're playing with life or lives. Speaking from experience, cell phones should be banned while driving because they slow your reaction time to anything that may be happening around you. Managing a cell phone while driving is now putting you in a life or death situation that you wouldn't want to be put in.    When someone decides to use their phone while driving they are not only putting themselves at risk, they are endangering every other person on the road  Phone use and driving are two activities that should never be intertwined. Using a phone while driving is not acceptable. The level of distraction that comes from using a phone takes a driver's attention away from the road. A driver's attention should be focused on the roadway, not a phone screen. Cell phone use while operating a motor vehicle has led to a heartbreaking amount of people losing their lives and even more injuries. It is simply not safe and can lead to dangerous and heart wrenching moments.  Driving requires focus on the road as well as the driver's surroundings and using cell phones while driving prevents that from occurring  Although cell phones may be used in a beneficial manner while driving, such as GPS use, crime reporting, or roadside assistance,  Visual distractions are a nuisance A visual distraction is anything that takes your eyes off the road. While driving we are constantly being side tracked by signs and advertisements we see all over the place from the newest restaurants opening, to the $100 billion Powerball billboards on the highway, the last thing you need to be doing is trying to reply to a text while paying attention to all of these catchy signs. And lastly, manual distractions which are any distractors causing you to take your hands off the wheel such as reaching for your phone to send that quick text. ",

                "content": "Sometimes, when a student isn't able to call a parent, they end up waiting for an hour or more outside the school until he/she is picked up from school. Students need to be able to use cell phones for situations like these, especially when they much homework to complete for school because then they have less time to do their required work.  Imagine you were a kid at school, and you forgot it was a shortened day. You need to call your parents but, no, you can't because your principal decided to ban cell phones all together. Now what?  They could take out and use their phones when teachers are not watching, and use them without being noticed. And when somebody gets caught, they just get angry at the school and have their parents come up to the school to get back the confiscated phone. This will give you no progress, as students would still use their phones in class and just get them taken away. Even if they have the chance of getting caught, they would still text or call somebody if they felt that it was something important.  This shows that the couple of seconds you take to text or look at your phone can take away the attention you are required to have on the road to ensure safety. Texting while driving could make you miss that there is construction going on, someone is walking, or etc. Parents should not call while their children are driving, they should call before or after they arrive at their destination. If their child is called he is going to look at their phone and some might answer, but all it could take is a look and boom the car goes into another lane or they hit someone or another car.  I forgot I had basketball practice at the gym after school and what should I do? You can simply call your ride and telling them they need to come later. What if your ride was your mom and you didn't have your phone because you didn't want any phones in your school? Well I can almost imagine what will happen next: my mom comes to pick me up, she doesn't find me, and every mom's first reaction to this mishap will be, \"MY SON/DAUGHTER HAS BEEN KIDNAPPED!\" This \"exciting\" commotion happened because you decided to go with Policy 2.   Calling your parent for a quick minute or two may secure your way of getting home or even to obtain a book you might have left at home for your next class. Also, talking to other classmates throughout your school may give you extra time to study with them or to finish a couple of assignments you were unsure about or needed help on. Communicating with cell phones will provide you extra time to do this by sending a text or giving them a quick call, after all lunch time and free periods don't last forever. This takes less time and gives you extra time for many other priorities you may have.  They also will no longer need to worry about distraction factor of driving. Drivers won't have to worry about trying to answer a phone call, respond to a text, or change a song and drive at the same time. The article states, \"Some manufacturers hope to do that by bringing in-car entertainment and information systems that use heads-up displays. Such displays can be turned off instantly when the driver needs to take over-something not available to driveres trying to text with a cell phone. In this way, the in-car system is actually a safety feature, and safety is a big concern.\" In this quote, Dr. Werner Huber, a BMW project manager driver, explains that a driver won't need to worry about answering a text. The driver can answer the text or phone call while the car is not in need of assistance. Fortunately, the car only needs manual assistance in areas of road construction or accidents. This feature of driverless cars will greatly benefit driving today.  Cell phones can come to use once in a while; if you need to contact a parent or guardian, or if there is an emergency, your able to call some one right away.  But those parents may not have the time to be their children teacher. In a situation like this having distant learning can give that child a way to learn at home with out their parent having to stop working\u00a0to become their teacher. This also makes the parent feel safe knowing their child is at home and away from a the safety concerns that come from being in a school. Along with the annoying phone calls and emails about their children's behavior or any other concerns the school usually will try contact get in contact about. My mother for one, is hates getting those calls throughout the day or emails flooding her inbox. This is a solution that can better everyone involved.  also, students would have to use a school phone to contact a parent if they are sick or forgot something, and not all teachers allow students to use class phones.

That in itself will give the student athletes more breathing room so they will have an easier time bringer their grades up. If these work than you can keep the required average at a C, but if these fail, that is when you would be obliged to make the required average a B so the students have more drive to keep their grades up. But at the time I think you should change the limitations of the sports programs in itself before any of the grade requirements are changed.  I believe you should make a policy that allows anyone with a C grade average or higher allowed to participate in sports and other activities. If they have a D or F grade average, then I agree that they should spend more of their time working on school work so they don't fail, but why make the students be above average just to participate in something besides school? I have three important reasons for pressing the matter.  If you change the policy then many students will be willing to push themselves for better grades so they can participate in school activities.  You also should keep this as a school policy because you shouldn't be able to participate if you are either failing a class or struggling to pass that class you need you won't be able to have any ability to do so in school sports and all. The student is just taking the class for nothing if he/she is failing just to be in a sport and that they don't care about their grade. He/she needs to keep a B average to be able to participate for that gain of socializing and gaining special abilities.   In conclusion, I believe that this is a very fair and reasonable policy. It will force kids to work out to their full potential, and they will have better grade point averages. The students must fully accept their responsibilty to live up to this potential so that the students, faculty, and coaches will be satisfied with the students.  Having the students maintain an grade B average at our school is a policy that should be passed.  Helping the students think for themselves, giving them necessary elements in life, and keeping them well rounded; this is what the policy offers. I think that the policy should be passed. It helps kids grow to be better adults, as well as help them in other situations in life. By doing the policy, it enhancing our generation, as well as many to come. Instead of more and more kids just barely making the grades, they will work towards being the best student they could be. The teachers are happy, the students feel proud of their grades, and all the activities are filled with smart wonderful children, this is why the policy you are suggesting should be passed and should be started in our school.  Despite the fact that many students have a grade C or below average, this new policy would encourage students to do well in school so that they can participate in sports,  Putting one-hundred percent of their efforts into academic-related activities, such as studying for exams, doing their homework, etcetera, will help students in the long run.  They will get better grades, go to better colleges, get better jobs, and ultimately live better lives. This policy encourages this needed hard work in school, thus, is a commendable one.  Everyone can make a grade B average, so this policy would not be unfair. It would challenge the students to do there best on every paper they turn in. The students would also learn new study skills, as well as fundamental organization skills that are needed in everyday life. If students could keep up with all their school stuff, study good, and keep good grades, then collage will be easier when it comes their time. It's proven that students that make the better grades do better in college and other activities, then the ones that make less decent grades. ",

I hope that I have swayed your opinion and that you are part of the sixty percent of Americans who are hungry for change.     In conclusion, I strongly feel that we need to change to an election by popular vote.\u00a0 Above all, it is more fair to the people.\u00a0 Citizens would feel that their votes matter more than they do now.\u00a0 People wouldn't have to be worried about if the electors would flip on what they had voted for.\u00a0 Although some say its is absolutely fair throughout all the states, there are still the set backs that come along with keeping an Electoral College.\u00a0 I agree with former presidents, Nixon and Carter, that we need to abolish the Electoral College.\u00a0 All of these reasons show you the problems there are with the current system of electing our President and I know you will agree  The electoral college should be abolished. It has caused nothing but problems for us in the past years. From ties, to innacuracy of votes, to causing re-counts. The electoral college is not putting America in the right direction. Most people don't like change, I am one of those people. Although, this change is for the better. And it should be strongly considered in the comig years  The electoral college needs to be abolished for the sake of our citizens. We would all benefit from changing the voting system to Popular Vote, on voting for the president of the United States  In conclusion, we should abolish the Electoral College in order to encourage more people to vote and to stop a catastrophe that is bound to happen soon. Acorrding to a Gallup poll done in 2000, over 60% over the American people would rather have a popular vote. This just prooves that the Electoral College is unfair, outdated, and irrational.   The election process is guided by this timeline, for example, voting starts on the second Thursday of the month of November every single time. The Electoral College is a huge part of this process also, and to destroy that would be heartbreaking for the nuerotics that can't stand any change in routine. If the Electoral College were to be abolished, and popular vote was to be instigated throughout the country, any semblance of a schedule would be torn away. Problems would spring up all over the place, and everything would all go to hell. Instead of recounts for counties, whole states would need recounts. If a populous state like Texas were to need a recount, never mind a week, a month wouldn't be enough time to recount it all perfectly. The government would be stuck without a leader, and worst case scenario, the United States of America could be put in a state of anarchy by the end of the decade. Then, we wouldn't be United anymore.   You cannot deny, changing to election by popular vote for the president of the United States would be extremely beneficial for our country. Citizens would regain their Constitutional-right to vote for the leaders who make major decisions for the entire country. The Electoral College is useful to produce a clear winner in elections, but is evidently not completely necessary and is unfair to voters who want and deserve a say in the outcome(Plumer 13, 14). Abolishing this system would cause for a drastically more fair election and greater citizen satisfaction for multitudinous reasons. Please consider.  Would you change history? Some people think that there some things that were made by our past Presidents should be changed. Such as our Electoral College, people say it should be changed to election by popular vote for the president of the United States.  The question of whether or not to abolish or keep the Electoral College in tact is a heavily debated one, but it is clear that getting rid of the Electoral College will be highly beneficial to the voters of America. The Electoral College was established hundreds of years ago when our Constitution came about and it created a complicated process to elect the President and Vice President of the United States.  I think that the Electoral College should be removed and replaced with popular vote only. It would make elections more fair, and it would make peoples' votes feel like they change something. ",

In my opinion, this change is immensely unfair to the student body, will cause disarray among the different clubs, and will hurt the school much more than it will aid the school. My understanding is that you are considering this policy change so that students will work harder to retain a B average and so the student body will improve, however, you must also consider the numerous possible negative consequences.  I think that it isn't right to change the school policy because some students cant pull there grade up to a B or higher.  Certainly you cannot think that such a change would be a good thing for the school! All it would bring is chaos and stress and the amount of people who improve would also find themselves always under pressure, always struggling to be above average. There are various things that could go wrong under such a monumental change. It would certainly be unfair to the students, the activities would be very disorganized (some of them might even be forced to close due to lack of participants), and it would be unhealthy for all your students.  By doing this, the students at our school will be smarter and more mature. The student will have to wok very hard to achieve a grade B average and will have to study more. Tests scores will go up and because the students want such good grades that they will have to pay attention during class; therefore, the students won't act out in class, as well as the activities they are in. They will care about the team or club and do their best. I think the policy for having a grade B average to be on activities at the school should be a yes.  For some students, this policy is outrageous and should be thrown out of consideration, for others such as myself, we believe that it is fully justified and would help drive students to achieve higher grades so that they may continue to participate in their sport.  In conclusion, changing the policy to participate in sports and other activities to having an average grade of a B instead of a C should be done.  This would require students to have to focus on the purpose of school, learning, before anything else.  Also, if students have a grade of a C, then they should have to spend the time they would use for sports or other activities to raise their grade.  Finally, being able to participate in sports and other activities should be a reward for working hard and receiving good grades.  As you can see, this is a policy change that should be made, as the opportunity to play sports and partake in other extra-curricular activities should be earned, not given. ",

The Electoral College does not provide a fair result nor a clear winner. The most popular vote system would significantly change that for the better of the country  In a popular vote election everyones vote counts not just those who are considered better than us because they hold authority over people. Those people can also be sneaky and can change votes to be in favor of their choice of president. They will even take bribes sometimes just becuase they can even though us other people do count.  In conclusion, the senator should change the voting system for many reasons. First, the popular vote is more reliable and there will always be a winner. Second, the electoral college has an even number of votes meaning there could be a tie therefore ruining the election. Finally, most people would like to personaly vote for theyre president rather than someone else to do it for you. These simple reason suggest why the senate should change the system.       \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  Because of the winer takes all system in each state it's unfair to the voters and it's unfair to me so changing the election by popular votes for the president of the united states would be best.  You cannot deny, changing to election by popular vote for the president of the United States would be extremely beneficial for our country.

Abolishing this system would cause for a drastically more fair election and greater citizen satisfaction for multitudinous reasons. Please consider.  If the popular vote becomes the new method in choosing the president, voters all across the nation will pay more attention to elections because they feel that their vote can make a difference, and it will. This will in turn increase the number of voters actively paying attention to their country's decisions.  Using the popular vote as the one and only way of electing presidents is needed in this country. The choice of presidents should be soley up to the american people. There should be no electoral college that can totally change the outcome of a election because one candidate doesent have enough electoral votes.  Replacing the electoral college with popular votes would be better for elections of presidents because, it's the peoples choice.  I believe that changing to election by popular vote for the president would be best bescause  I can see how this could support changing to election by popular vote, and how it could be reasonable. If our president was chosen by popular vote, then he would visit all of the states, trying to win them over. However, there are some strong arguments against this. To begin with, one man would have to visit 50 states, and even if he only visited the majority, there is still a posibility that the state will not vote for him anyways, in the end. If we keep the Electoral College, then the majority of votes in a state would count, not his popularity. As a fourteen year old, I can relate this to highschool. A student can be the most popular student in the school, but they can also be the most rude and mean. And while another student may not be popular, they can be the nicest in the school. If the president was chosen by a popular vote, he might just end up being the worst thing that could happen to the country. ",

Although, there are bountieous reasons why driverless cars are a good thing, there are also myriads of reasons as of why this could also be a bad thing.  The article \"Driverless Cars Are Coming\" speaks about how traffic laws are currently written to include human control of the vehicle in Paragraph 9. Furthermore, it talks about how limited the allowance of testing is. With a large scale rejection of such ideas it is wise to consider the fact that there is not just assumptions made by everyone. The article blatantly puts down the states who did not follow suit in allowing the tests. There was not any consideration of the majority possibly deciding this based on solid fact and the issues not yet addressed by the companies manufacturing the vehicles. So, the legality of the driverless cars is merely one point amongst a plethora of other issues.  Because of these specific examples in the article \"Driverless Cars Are Coming,\" I believe that driverless cars will be very beneficial to America and it's many modes of transportation. Driverless cars will use less fuel than our typical cars we use today. They will also require an immensely small amount of attention. Most importantly, any small flaw that these cars possess will be resolved extremely soon. Driverless cars will change our lives for the better.  Technology has improved immensely just in the last sixteen years. According to the article \"Driverless Cars Are Coming\", before 2000, a rover was \" device on a hilltop that cost two hundred million dollars\". Now, humans are trying to create cars that does not need a driver. Though technology has gone far, it has not gone far enough to accomplish such a feat.  In the article \"Driverless Cars Are Coming,\" it says that the current taxi system would be taken over by driverless cars. this would put hundreds of thousands of taxi and Uber drivers out of a job. There are also some jobs that cannot be replaced by driverless cars. A job like the trash collector would require the driver to get into the driveway, and get in the correct position to properly and safely collect the trash. Emergerency response vehicles like ambulances, police cars, and fire trucks would also need drivers to get them through traffic quickly, efficiantly, and safely.  My first piece of evidence for this is that driverless cars are machines, and despite having a notoriously bad reputation for failing at times due to some error during the design process, machines do not tire and do not grumble about watching their surroundings; they also need not be perfect, only better than a person to become favorable as a driver. My second piece of evidence comes from, once again, \"Driverless Cars Are Coming\" when it was stated that \"enetertainment and information systems that use heads up displays [...] can be turne doff instantly when the driver needs to take over [in the case that the car senses that its own computing devices are not enough to handle a situation]\". This system appealed to me a lot due to how intuitive it is; if a person shouldn't be using something, it turns off, no questions asked. All of these factors further lead me to believe that cars are \"the way of the future\".  The United States, as well as other parts of the world, experience oil and fuel issues. There are frequent shortages of these particular substances, which are extrememly important for our daily lives. In the article, it is said, \"The cars he foresees would use half the fuel of today's taxis and offer far more flexibility than a bus. He believes such cars would fundamentally change the world.\" In this quote, from the article \"Driverless Cars Are Coming,\" Google cofounder Sergey Brin expresses that these driverless cars will be beneficial to America and the rest of the world  I believe that development and research for the creation of truly automatic transportation should be continued, based on information from \"Driverless Cars Are Coming:  As stated in the \"Driverless Cars Are Coming\" article, Google cofounder Sergey Brin believes that his idea of a driverless car public transport system would use half the feul as today's taxis. As our feul is a fossil feul, meaning one day it will run out, using as little of it as possible is much more than just a good thing. Also, using this idea of a driverless car public transport system would save us a lot of money. Not having to drive your own car and fill it up every week would save you quite a bit on gas money. Also, you would not have to pay for repairs or damages to your vehicle.  Its pretty expensive to even to make a proto type or test run these so called \"Diverless Cars\". If a car like such is created how would the world be changed? Not only would the car itself be expensive to create but theres more factors to just creating the cars, its how the cars themslef work. In the article, \"Driverless Cars Are Coming\" the author tells about some proto types or car similar to the \"Driverless car\" image. The authors gives an example about cars that uses sensors or radio signals that are telling the cars what to do. That means, the roads would have to give off certain signals that contribute to the car itself, the roads and lights would also have to have signals and sensors. It would cost tons of money to do things such as rebulid roads or lights so cars like these would properly worl. ",

                "content": "Venus, otherwise known as the \"Evening Star,\" is one of the more challenging planets to examine closely in our solar system. While this plant is often called Earth's twin, it is vastly different in terms of environment and hospitability. Despite being the closest planet to Earth at times, no spaceship has touched down on Venus in over thirty years. The dangers presented by Venus are many, but the author greatly supports the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite these dangers.  The first paragraph introduces the topic of Venus with an interesting hook, but does not give the reader their side. The reader needs a thesis, without one the reader is not going to be able to have their opinion on a topic swayed. The author's current attempt at a thesis statement , \"While Venus is simple to see from the distant but safe vantage point of Earth, it has proved very challenging place to examine more closely,\" does not state what side they are on clearly. Their best declaration of the side they are on is in their very last paragraph. The author wrote, \"Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation.\" This is a very strongly worded thesis, but would have been much better if placed in the starting paragraph. Their side on the topic was acknowledged, but not as well as it could have been if they had set up their thesis correctly.  Multiple times, the author delves into a side-topic as opposed to continuing on with the topic of Venus exploration. They start off the article with two sentences that have no relation to the story, yet confuse readers. The sentences are about Venus' nickname, the \"Evening Star\", and how even though it is a planet, it is still called this. This is completely irrelevant to exploration, as everyone knows it is a planet, and the \"Evening Star\" name is never mentioned again. Later on in the passage, the author rambles on about World War II-age computers and how they functioned properly even before the digital age. Once more, this is slightly irrelevant and does not contribute to the story at all except to add another paragraph instead of focusing on the specifics of how NASA is using them to help with Venus.  Venus is the second planet in the solar system from the sun that precedes Earth in the planetary order. This planet is often called Earth's \"twin\" and the \"Evening Star\" of the universe because of its brightness and relative similarity to the Earth. In the article, \"The Challenge of Exploring Venus,\" the author presents facts and figures that one could use to determine whether studying Venus would be an advantageous pursuit even though it would not be very safe. The author focuses more on the drawbacks of exploring Venus, hence the title of this work.  In conclusion, the claim about Venus being a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents that the author of \"The Challenges of Exploring Venus\" states is well supported by facts and perfectly thought out ideas. Although Venus is an extremely dangerous planet packed with many reasons as to why exploration is currently held back, NASA is still looking for ways to be able to gain more valuable insight about the Evening Star. Just like the author said, learning and travelling should not be limited by doubts, and scientists will not let doubts and fears stop them.  The idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the presented dangers is supported through Venus' proximity. The author conveys the usefulness of having Venus so close,  The author also suggests that Venus is a good candidate for exploration because of it's occasional proximity to Earth. \"...sometimes [Venus is] our nearest option for a planetary visit, a crucial consideration given the long time frames of space travel\" (The Challenge 4).  The writer claims that Venus is referred to as Earth's \"twin''. But the only evidence he gives to back up this claim is that \"Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of desnity and size.\"  Venus' relation to Earth is significant because it is the closest example of another planet like Earth.  But there could be more than what meets the eye. In parapgraph six, the writer says that,\" peering a Venus from a ship orbiting or hovering safely far above the planet can provide only limited insight on ground conditions becuase most forms of light cannot penetrate the dense atmosphere.\" ",

                "content": "Plus, when you gain advice, you yourself may also be able to help people. From personal experience, I know that I have gained a lot of knowledge from other people telling me a few simple words. I have also been given bad advice for my current situation, but I have found it very helpful later in life. A lot of people don't refer back to old information, because they are so used to constantly gaining more. I think the reason for that is because of work and school, it;s human nature to constantly gain new information. By asking others for advice, you are not only helping yourself, but you are also helping the people that will come to you for advice in the future. Just few words can change the a persons life.  It can help if you have a friend or family member you can trust that has a strong opinion, because sometimes you need it. There is always going to be a couple or strong people in your life that's going to help you make right decisions either if you are going down the wrong road, or if you are doing the right thing in life and you just need motivation. If a person was struggling in high school and they really needed to step up their life and grown up more, they would really need to good influences or somebody to tell them where they are going wrong. People that can step up with their own voice on the situation that has known the person, and that could really help them get their life together. Personally, the type of people everyone needs is somebody that has strong beliefs and values and that would care for their loved ones. That could especially help in benefiting someone's life going toward the future  It's all in your control. Depending on what the choice is, it may effect people's daily lifes (in a positive way).` What people do like is changes that benefit them. The choice you made could change the routine of the person's daily life, they may have less to do on their time or maybe something that they are offered that could be nice. There is usually emergencies where someone need help from a fire or a robber, but you could prevent the disaster from happening. Finally, all of this makes you look like a caring human being. All humans would be grateful for the time that you have sacrificed for a beneficial choice to all, because you asked for multiple opinions, and you understood. This has all happened because you cared for others opinions.  Its give's you more option's, people who have already been their can be the most helpful, and overall having a second opinion can be more helpful than you know. And having more option's than you need can help you weather it's a big decision or a little one. And having more can help you pick out the one's you dont need and help you find the one's you do need. And you may find out that what someone said really helped you and you may go back to the for more advice and it's just a never ending loop to help you everyday.\u00a0 \u00a0  Now this statement may seem contradictory at first. \"How would having to go through more words, people, and ideas help me to get to a clearer understanding of my situation? Wouldn't that just cloud up everything?\" you ask. Well, actually, it does the complete opposite! If you only have one opinion, there's less of a chance that you will find the right answer. It's good to narrow down your points once everything you need is presented, but when you have little to almost nothing to go off of in the first place, it's less likely that your choice will be properly informed. Another reason that you may have trouble only going off of one person, is that somebodies advice could be very biased, which could cloud your mindset from the get go. When someone's advice is based only off of their opinion of the person or thing and not your situation or well being, it can be confusing at best, and directly harmful at worst. Finally, there are plenty more options you can choose from as well. This can make it easier to get the exact answer you need. Think about it like looking for an exact brand of paper you need for work . You may not find it at the first store you go to, you might have to drive around town to find it. All and all, having multiple opinions gives you more things to consider, making it easier to come to your conclusion.  If they try to take a step in your shoes, and feel how your feeling about the situation then they can process and understand exactly whats happening and what they have to say about it. For example, if you are really sad about something and you talk to your friends about it, it allows them to feel empathy, and try to understand why you are sad, and what they can do to help you. Them seeing things through your point of view allowed them to feel what you are feeling which is why its easy and beneficial to get advice from multiple people. Especially people you trust.  As stated in by Nick D'Alto, most human communication is not verbal. Meaning that people express their emotions by their looks or their actions, but they chose when to do this. The Facial Action Coding System takes away this freedom from students, they do not have the choice when to express what they are feeling if anyone can just use a face scanning system on them. \" Imagine being able to detect exaclty how other people are feeling, even when they are trying to hide their emotions (D'Alto 1),\" this first sentence perfectly shows how it takes away peoples freedom of when they want to express certian emotions tocertian people.   Overall, I feel that I have made many points and examples on why students should have to do at least one extracurricular activity. Such as it helping you make new friends, it can help them discover hobbies, it improving confidence and team building skills, and how we shouldn't focus on the minority when it comes to this rule. This rule can really help so many people that can't break out of their shells on their own, and really save them from a dark future without any support to help them through it  When you hear a different perspective of a choice it tells you how the people may have experienced a problem related to yours. You can learn from those past experiences, figure out what went wrong and if nothing did go wrong, then see how you could make it better. It really helps when you know the background of most people's experience related to the topic. You can piece together the information, or write a list of the pros and cons of each perpective and combine all the pros. Finally, when you have your idea of all the perspectives you now know which choice you or others could most benefit from. The choice could now help benefit all kinds of people, since you understand the perspective of all people big and small.   It has been proven that stress only causes harmful and emotional side effects to individuals. So, why not remove it? That is exactly why simple checks on your work, or something you may be unsure about can make a real impact. As stressful as everyday human lives can be, there's no harm done in taking a little out of your time to ask others about your situation and how to deal with it. Being more sure on something can cause an individual to worry less and end up making better decisions. Maybe you have a huge decision coming up like a proposal. You need to be absolutely sure and know it in your gut that this is the right decision to be made, and asking others can help you know that you are making the right decision or you are making the wrong decision ",

                "content": "Without this policy students who say they want to join clubs at their school are not motivated to act on what they said, instead choosing to go home and do nothing. Currently there are hundreds students in school that say they would like to join one of the various clubs offered, but find themselves simply riding the bus home and spending the rest of the day on their phone. This occurs due to a lack of motivation from anyone in school urging the students to join an extracurricular activity. Parents can only do so much for their kids when it comes to what their kids do in school, and some kids find ways to get out of joining any clubs. This is why schools need to put this policy in place to not allow their students talents go too waste. Not only would this policy help students explore interests they have, it would help everyone see how unique and diverse each person is.  For example, Students in the public education system can only enroll in courses that are offered at their school. This may restrict students from taking classes that they are interested in or limit students from branching out and potentially finding a new passion. However, students taking online classes can choose from a wide variety of classes, that most likely incorporate their interests. The lack of restraint in regards to the courses offered in distance learning is beneficial for students. Not only do student have the freedom to choose what to learn, they also have the freedom to choose when to learn. Having the freedom of choosing when to learn is vital for students with specific needs or disabilities. When students are unable to go to school, learning can continue. This eliminates sick days, weather delays or cancellations, and school holidays. Furthermore, students are able to take courses at their own speed. Rather than the typical every other\u00a0day school schedule, students can master a course in less than a month. The lack of restraint in regards to the courses offered in distance learning and when a student can learn is beneficial for all students.  Most schools consist of people from various races, ethnicities, backgrounds, sexes, and learning capabilities. Not every student thinks the same way, so they should be encouraged to express their creativity to establish a diverse school setting. Additionally, some students may possess specific learning disabilities such as ADHD, dyslexia, autism, mental illnesses, and more. In this case, these students require much more attention from their teachers to help guide them through this process, but an online class can only do so much. The teachers may be going at a faster pace than what these students can normally handle or they are confused about a certain area of the subject, so their frustrations may build up and lead to detrimental effects on their mental health. Although it is considered to be personalized learning, these individuals require careful guidance towards achieving the same success that their counterparts are experiencing. In the sense of virtual learning, these individuals are at a disadvantage because their learning disabilities are beyond their control. Video conferencing may be an option, but students with learning disabilities prefer not to share with their peers that they are struggling in a certain area or having difficulties understanding the curriculum, but would much rather keep this information confidential between themselves and their teachers.  Schools have a day where both teachers and students can meet in order to do missing work or get the extra help they need. My school for example offers a specific class called lancer time where kids get a pass from their teachers and go to them for any reason possible. If you still need help then you can stay after school on a specific day and there is transportation provided. This is very convenient because if at any given moment a student needs help with something they can go and get it. Home schooled students don't have this option because they are being taught at home and arent' attending a school. This is very inconvenient because what would happen if a student needs help with something, they won't be able to get the help they need. If you attend a physical school then it's going to be very easy for you to get the help you need whenever you need it. Another way is by going to a class full of people you can get someone, like a friend, to help you and then you can both compare work to see if you are doing it right. If you're home schooled then you don't really have the option to have your friend\u00a0help you or have any way of making sure your work is correct. That being said it's better for students to go to an actual physical school, so that they are able to get the help they need in order to succeed.  social skills, much like life skills, have their place in students' daily lives as well. It might not feel like it when teachers are constantly telling their classes to \"quiet down\" and \"focus on their assignments\", but the adults within the school building are just as aware of the psychological and emotional benefits of social interaction as teens. Therefore, students attending traditional public schools are alotted time, such as lunch or study hall, to hang out with friends and strengthen their interpersonal relationships. It is for these same reasons that most schools host memorable events outside of their eight-hour days for students to enjoy. Proms, talent shows, sporting events, and other staples of American high school serve no other purpose than providing social entertainment and positive experiences. On the other hand, online classes force students to spend countless hours sitting behind a computer screen, completely separated from their peers.  Public school students encounter people of many different races, religions, sexualities, ableness, and neuro activity. Because of this, these students have no problem facing the real world with all the people who are nothing like them. Online students may experience a type of culture shock when they go to college or enter the workforce and meet a person who is a different race than them, someone with a disibility, a person on the autism spectrum, or even a person who practices a different religion than they do. This is a sensation unknown to most public school students because of how they are exposed to many different and diverse groups of people at a young age. This type of culture shock could cause problems for these online students in our increasingly open-minded and progressive world.  Adding onto getting work done, many students prefer working in an environment special or more comfortable to them. One major reasoning for that is one's medical conditions. Nowadays, many public schools offer a special education program, but to many, the system might not exactly meet their requirements. Many handicap students need special transportation, seating, and feeding, which schools may not be able to provide. They also require alert attention at all times because anything could happen to cause them discomfort, pain, or even to fall down. Other students going through a health issue may find schooling at home to be rather more comfortable due to the same reasons. At home, the students will have their family members to look and care for them. Besides the staff not being able to properly handle students in need of\u00a0altunitive care, the, \"regular,\" students attending the school can also be an issue. Kids of today are not the nicest and love tearing others down on their insecurities. Bullying could be a serious concern to many special education students.  Historically, children have only been able to receive an education by traveling to a building known as a school. In this building, there are classrooms, desks, boards, teachers, etc., but most importantly, the outlet to a successful future. Over time, more and more developments have been made in order to improve the quality of the curriculum that students learn in school. With the rise of technology, even the location of schooling has begun to vary with the addition of a unique option: learning from home. Online video conferences and other such facilities allow for students to access the same materials that they would be given at a traditional school  While school is a vaulable place to learn new information and facts, it is really a place for children to grow and become more independent and better human beings. While grades matter, the emotional and pyschological health of a student is far more valuable. The FACS technology could act as an army of school counselers. High School and Middle School students tend not to share their emotions, even with their parents. FACS could idntify students that are emotionally troubled, have depression, contemplate self harm or even have mental illness. Once students like these are identified then counselers and social workers could step in, allowing for students to be helped. Right now students that struggle with these issues do not share their feelings. They do not get help and carry on like they are fine. While many may turn out to be okay, even one taking their own life or somebody's else, is too much. While FACS may not be able to help or eliminate all signs of emotional distress, it can surely make a difference. Another benfit of using FACS is that it reads emotoins silently. Students don't have to potray a certain emotion for the technology to understand what they are really feeling. If a studnet is asked how they are, they probably give a surface level, I am fine, answer. The technology reads through that completely, eliminating awkard one on one conversatoins with conselers, and allowing for all students to be reached.  Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. This allows students to learn in the comfort of their own home, without having to transport to a private, or public school. This may be convienent for parents who work on a busy schedule, allowing them to choose when and where they want their chilldren to learn.  Although online schooling my be beneficial to some children, it may harm their future. ",

                "content": "Hi, I'm Luke Bomberger. I was a Seagoing Cowboy. You might be pondering what that is, and if you are, I will inform you. Seagoing Cowboys help animals, mostly horses, donkeys, cows, and mules, that are being shipped overseas to avoid harm get to their destination. Are you thinking that you maight like being part of this program?  When I was a Seagoing Cowboy, it opened up the world to me. I saw that the world wasn't all sunshine and rainbows, like the little me thought. The world was full of unfairness and was my job, everybody's job, to help stop it. I stepped up to do my part by joining the Seagoing Cowboys. Do your part. Join the Seagoing Cowboys program today. Make the world a better place, one cow at a time.  You should become a Seagoing Cowboy for sure! If you like animals and travling this is the job for you! You can have so much adventure you would'nt even know what to do with it! This generation needs to carry on with the Seagoing Cowboys! To help animals and more! One day we will need your help more than ever! We need this to keep going with the Seagoing Cowboys! He even know himself it was an opportunity of a lifetime.         the seagoing Cowboys program is a very helpful thing, and it woul;d be wonderful if you joined. We always like a little extra muscle. It really is awesome to go sightseeing, get tours of famous places, and see all the tourist attractions that you wouldn't even have a small chance at seeing if you weren't a seagoing Cowboys. Please join us, and have some fun while your at it.  I loved the opportunity to become a seagoing cowboy, even if it was for a short period of time. I was able to learn animal body language and more about how to take care of the animals. I was able to see many great things like the castle in Crete and the Panama Canal. I also learned about culture in many other countries and some of the hardships of living there. The trips made me more aware of the hardships every person in other countries face every, single day of their lives. I hope that all of these reasons convinced you to become a seagoing cowboy.      While I was in the Seagoing Cowboys program I made nine trips it was the most of any Seagoing Cowboy it was great. I saw so many amazing places I thought I would never be able to see because I was just a normal person in my town. I saw Europe and China while I was in the program it was a great experience for me as a almost adult. I also had the advantage of taking a gondola ride in Venice,Italy, it was the city with the streets of water. I also had a awesome chance at touring the excavated castle in Crete and marveled at the Panama Canal on my way to China in the Seagoing trip. You should join it so you can see all those amazing places I just stated to you that I have seen because of this amazing experience in the Seagoing Cowboys. Another reason you should join it is because if you are almost 18 and you do not want to get military drafted then join this, they count it as your service or they did for me which means they will for you. Another one is after the animals get dropped off and we are going back with no animals we get to play amazing games in the stalls that the animals were in like baseball and volleyball, we also played table-tennis tournaments or even boxing.  These are all the amazing things i got to do and see, you could see and do them to if you join Seagoing Cowboys.  My overall thought on becoming a Seagoing Cowboy is amazed by all the good you would be doing for the world.  You will get to help others in need if you become a Seagoing Cowboy.  The Seagoing Cowboys program is a fun experience in many ways.  Taking participation in the Seagoing Cowboys program is more of a different world then an adventure! This program helps you think of the people in need and how much you have helped them. Participating in this fun program is a great idea! Just imagine... riding on a boat, mist spraying, cooling you off after a long day herding animals. You have the benefit to see and tour many places that you have never seen before! ",

Although some conspiracy theorists say differently, and think that is some sort of ancient civilization building these objects.   the only reason the natural landform even remotely looked like a face was because of shadows.  In conclusion, the face is just a natural landform. It may look like a head, but that is just because of the unusual shadows that the mesa has. If my co-workers and I thought this was actually proof of alien life, why would we hide it from you? What is the point in hiding that kind of information?  In 1988 a Viking 1 took a, slightly disturbing, picture. Of a face! Viking 1 found a landform that happends to look like an Egyptian Pharoah. This face was found and started major controversy.  Some people had thought that it was fake and others thought that it was just a coincidence. The massive sand storms just created a face. That's all that they thought. But can that be true?   There you have it. The Face sadly wasn't built by aliens, it was just a natural landform that happened to have some pretty neat features to it due to shadows. There is no way around it, because the pictures don't lie. It is even more obvious that it is a landform because ones just like it exist on Earth! Even though it would've been very interesting for it to have been actually created by aliens, it was just a natural landform in the end.  Well, there are actually plenty of reasons why it is just a normal landform with unusual shadows.  I know what you might be thinking. How could it only be a natural landform? It looks exactly like a face, so it must have been created by something or someone.  It looked like an Egyptian pharoah, but turned out to be a regular, old mesa. It is still debated whether it was created by ancient Martian life, or whether is was just another regular landform on Mars.  Mars has been a planet that we have been exploring for many years. We have discovered many abnormal objects on the planet. In 1976, we took a picture of the region Cydonia, and we found something that seemed to look like a human face. Our eyes are adapted to recognizing faces and that is why we recognized the face on Mars more easily. Higher quality images that were taken in 2001 show that the face on Mars is no sign of ancient civilization on Mars but in fact a mesa.  The \"face\" isn't any perticular shape that any man or alien would want. The landform would be shaped as a circle, square or any other simple shape, and it would not be so ridgid and cracked. If you were to look at the photo furthest to the left, you would assume that it resembled a face, but If you compair that photo to the one taken twenty-five years later, you would begin to understand that to photo was out-dated and that the camera was not as clear as the one taken later. In addition, why would an alien make a structure of a human's face.  ",

                "content": "According to the article \"Making Mona Lisa Smile,\" there is a new technology called the Facial Action Coding System (FACS) that enables computers to identify human emotions. This technology is relatively brand new. It creates a 3-D computer model of all fourty-four major muscles in the face that move like human muscles as well. Then, psychologists have classified six basic emotions that are associated with different movements in the facial mucles. This new technology could result in many benefits in our community as well as all around the world  In the article \"Making Mona Lisa Smile,\" the author explains how certain algorithms built into a system, called the Facial Action Coding System, can detect human emotions. In the article, the author describes how a classroom computer can recognize when a student is getting bored or confused based on their facial expressions. This computer can change the way that the lesson is being taught so that the students are more productive in classes.  Leonardo Da Vinci was one of the greatest reniassance painters of the time. His study of the human anatomy allowed him to create pictures that captured the humna state. On of his most well known paintings is the \"Mona Lisa\". The Mona Lisa is a women that has sort of complacent facial features. She doesn't really look happy or sad. This was the popular thought up until a new technology was created. This technology is called the Facial Action Coding System. This technology is able to deduce what emotion a person is feeling. It is able to do this whothout the person even showing an obvious emotion. This technology can also be implenmented in many spheres of life, including in the classroom.  The implications of technology that can detect emotions simply by reading the muscles in the face sound truly remarkable. The thought that one can tell what another is thinking simply by plugging data or maybe even a picture into an algorithm sounds like fiction, but may soon be a reality. The article, \"Making Mona Lisa Smile\" by Nick D'Alto briefly discusses the possible use of such technology in a classroom. The system could examine student's faces, and if they read to be unengaged or uninterested, could adjust the lesson to make learning more interesting to that group of students. That type of technology could revolutionize learning, and customly tailor lesson plans to the feelings of students on any given day.  In the passage \" Making Mona Lisa Smile\" the author states in paragraph 6 line 6,\"A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,\"Dr Huang predicts.\"then it could modify the lesson like an effective human instructor.\",this kind of technology can possibly boost testing score and even help children falling behind instead of holding them back another year. The text also states in paragraph 6 line 10 that ;\"Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communcation,\"notes Dr. Huang.\". This example actually explains alot of real world issues in the classroom, such as the fact that some students refuse to even try to communicate their confusion or boredom in the classroom so then they often disengage in the lesson and miss every part that would be essential to reaching standards created by the state.  Slip into a world where emotions are easily read. There could be no mind games, no pettiness, and no suffering in silence;this could be the new reality. In the article \"Making Mona Lisa Smile\" by Nick D'Alto, he introduces a new concept created by Thomas Haung:Facial Action Coding System software. This programming system allows computers to register all of the emotions on an individual's face, reguardless if they are mixed.  In the sixth paragraph of the article \"Making Mona Lisa Smile,\" the author illuminates the possibilites of success human-emotion-recognizing computer software provides in terms the world of marketing, describing how analyzing the emotional response to a Web ad popping up on one's computer screen can mold the variety of its future ads to a more preferred selection (6).  At the seventh passage, the author states that, \"Your home PC can't handle the complex algorithms used to decode Mona Lisa's smile,\" suggesting that the majority of modern computers do not have the power to actually run the software. The PCs that schools buy are almost never more powerful than the ones bought by consumers for household use, and would thus also not be able to process the data, making the technology rather useless in an educational setting.  The text states, \" Your home PC can't handle the complex algorithms used to decode Mona Lisa's smile,\" (D'Alto 7). This shows that normal computers that students would typically use cannot support this technology, making the school buy the technology that can support it. This would be a costly job and if the school cannot pay for it then the students would have to and some families may not be able to afford it  Educators have a very important job. They are building the future for society, which can be very hard. Teachers have to deal with many students, and every student is different. With the use of the Facial Action Coding System, teachers don't have to worry about a teaching method that will not work with all students. In the article \"Making Mona Lisa Smile\" by Nick D'Alto it says that the system recognizes if a student is confused, and alters the lesson to better fit the student. This allows educators to not worry about finding a teaching method that suites every student. This technology also helps out educators, because it works one on one with students. It's made to help every student individually by reading the student's facial expressions. As student's learning patterns may change, the system changes with the student. The use of this technology will also be helpful for teachers because educators can take a look and see what teaching methods work the best with students overall. In the article it says the system can detect when students are confused and bored, so educators can use this technology to see what doesn't make students feel confused nor bored. This technology could be very valuable and helpful for educators. ",

                "content": "Being the second-closest planet to the sun provides for some nearly impossible conditions for human exploration.  Venus is the second planet in the Milky Way solar system, that is so close yet so mysterious. Its conditions are unhabitable and unsafe for humans, making Earth seem safe despite some dangers it also has. Venus may well have also been covered with oceans like Earth currently has.  People are facinated with the Man on the Moon and the idea of Martians, but most people do not think about life on Venus. Venus is the second planet from the sun and shares many geographical features with Earth. However, studying this planet is made difficult by the dense and toxic atmosphere, high temperatures, and violent weather. Despite this, some people think that Venus should still be explored, and the author of \"The Challenge of Exploring Venus\" is of this opinion.  Venus is the second planet in the solar system from the sun that precedes Earth in the planetary order. This planet is often called Earth's \"twin\" and the \"Evening Star\" of the universe because of its brightness and relative similarity to the Earth. In the article, \"The Challenge of Exploring Venus,\" the author presents facts and figures that one could use to determine whether studying Venus would be an advantageous pursuit even though it would not be very safe. The author focuses more on the drawbacks of exploring Venus, hence the title of this work.  Well, first of all, The atmospere of Venus has a THICK layer of carbon dioxide the covers 98% of the planet, in which makes Everything a much hoter place,but, to top it of with the atmosphere problem, the clouds in there have highly corrosive sulfuric acid. If we some how passes through the atmosphere, than we'll face ANOTHER problem with the ground. Since Venus is the second planet from our sun and with all those carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, the surface ground temperature is over 800 DEGREES FAHRENHEIT. In which with the surface and the atmosphere, it could basically melt many types of metal with no problem. Another Problem is that the atmosphereic preassure is 90x greater than our Earth, with that much preassure could easily crushed a submarine that is built to surrvive the deeper end of the ocean. From what we gather small information from our space craft, the geology of venus pretty much have erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lighting strikes.  The second issue, according to the people who want to stay grounded on Earth, is important for both sides to recognize. The people in the second perspective say it is not safe to go to Venus. We have tried it unmanned, and the unmanned spaceship counldn't live there for longer than a few hours, so it is too dangerous. \"On the planet\u0092s surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet. These conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth...\" (Paragraph 3). This quote helps support the second perspective for wanting NASA to kept its space ships from going to Venus. As the quote says, Venus is a very dangerous planet.  The Challenge of Exploring Venus\" is an article about the positives and negatives of trying to land a spacecraft on Venus. He has a decent build-up into his first point while giving more and more small facts about our second planet.  These are all questions that need to be considered when brainstoming the idea of visitng another planet. The author of this article is avoiding all of these mainstream problems by simply saying it's worth the risks, when it actaully is not. In paragraph 3, the author explains all of the dangers of Venus and how they can affect humans. He explains, \" On the planet's surface, the temperature averages over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet.\" Considering that this is true, we can definitrly assume that condition on Venus are severly dangerous, and a lot of people may get hurt trying to explore it. The aurthor also states, \" These conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth; such an environment would crush even a submarine accustomed to diving to the deepest parts of our oeans and would liquefy many metals. What the author is stating here is that not even our strongest materials and creations can withstand the conditions on Venus. This means that in order to explore Venus we have to design all new machinery, which would cost a lot of money, not to mention the human costs as we would need humans to test things out. He also makes it notable that venus has the hottest surface of any planet, despite not being the closest to the sun. All of these facts are serious concerns when regarding human safety as well as propr functioning of machines. Even if exploring Venus was a possibilty, would it be even be worth it after all of he human costs and money costs or paid. What we are discussing here is putting human lives at risk, and spending a ton of money on a project that is no where near being ready ready to present. These reasons as well as the provided facts assure me on my claim that the author did a terrible job of supporting this idea of exploration.  In the second paragraph, the author states \"...Often referred to as Earth's twin, Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size, and occasionally the closest in distance too.\"  Although Venus is analogous to Earth, there are slight differences of the two planets. Earth has average low and high temperatures, while the temperatures of Venus are more extreme. Paragraph 5 reads, \"At thirty-plus miles above the surface, temperatures would still be toasty at around 170 degrees Fahrenheit, but the air pressure would be close to that of sea level on Earth. Solar power would be plentiful, and radiaton would not exceed Earth levels. Not easy conditions, but survivable for humans\" (The Challenge of Exploring Venus). ",

                "content": "To conclude I belive that my state senator should remove the electoral colleges. To change the election by popular vote for the president of the United States. For the fact that voters vote not for the president but for a slate of electors. Who can always defy the will of the people. It should also be removed because its simply unfair to the voters. There votes may or may not be counted or may vote for the wrong person or oppsite party. The Electoral College is unfair, outdated, and irrational.     In my opinoin I think we should absolutely keep the Electoral College system.  \u00a0 In the article,\"Does the Electoral College Work\", it states that becasue of the diffrent sizes of our states some people feel they do not get a fair say in who makes decisions for our country. They feel that because they dont live in a big state like Texas they do not have equal say in the decisions our country makes. In the article Plumer wrote, \" In the same vein, faithless electors have pccasionally refused to vote for their party's canidate and cast a deciding vote for whoever they please...\". The Electoral College is changing peoples mind set on how to vote because they feel why should we care if the government does not, can you blame them? If we just took out the simple problem of the Electoral College more voters will vote honestly rather then go with everyone elses vote.  Richard Nixon, Jimmy carter, Bob Dole, and plenty of oothers think that it should change because according to a gallup poll in 2000 taken shortlyafer Al Gore he wonn the popular vote but lost the presidency dur to the quirks of the electoral college. in the Electoral College system people vote not for the prresident but for a slate of electors as i had said in the last pargrraph who in turn elect or the president. electors could be anyon not holding public office. voters sometimes control who there electors vote for. wich makes the voters sometimes get confsed about the electors wich makes them vote for the wrong candidate. In the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in the centery. in 1960 segegaters in Louisiana legslater nearly suceeddin replacing Democratic electora with new electors. So that the popular vote for Kennedy woulld not have actually gone to Kennedy. So them electors in the same vein they qould have to occasionally refuse to vote for the partys cannidate and cast a decideiing vote to who ever they please.  im writting this letter to you so you consider changing to election by popular vote for the prsident of the united states instead of electoral college. i belive like branford plumer, that the electoral college is very wrong not only because under the electoral college system, voters dont vote for the president but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president. but also because it is very unfair to voters, candidates dont spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the \"swing\" states.  For my conclusion this proves that there are many difficulties along the way of an election, regarding the votes and voters. With this letter being written, people should not wonder whether or not the electoral college should be abolished, and go with the popluar voting method. You shouldn't be thinking about just a couple of people, but of a whole nation and deciding who is worthy enough in our eyes to lead us to more victories with the popular voting method.     What Is the Electoral College?\" states you are voting for electors when you vote, but what is the point if they can simply defy you? It would be like if after the president was chosen, the Senate could overule him with a 1/5 vote. There is also the point in Plumer's article about the time Hawaii sent two slates, which forced the desicion to Nixon, who had to validate only the opponet's votes in fear of otherwise receiving bad publicity. There is also the strange way of resolving a tie, which boils down to the same thing as the winner-take-all system, except if more people support\u00a0 it doesn't matter. It would be like if everybody in the\u00a0 room wasn't alowed to vote, other than one voted, but everybody in the room agreed anyway for some strange, miraculous reason. (Of course, the one guy in the\u00a0 next room doesn't agree, and completely takes out your vote, regardless of the fact that there were 30 people in this one.)  Also, the Electoral College should change the election by poplular vote for the president of the United States because, when choosing your's elctors when you vote for your candidate you are actually voting for your candidate's electors.  what is this electoral college? You are telling me that i vote for electors thta supposedly are pulling fior my choice of candidate for pesident. I don't think that is right to just take my choice of president and put it in someone else's hands. It should be my choice to whom I want it to be. Now I realize that there is probably some rule that prevents them to changing their mind, but actually I don't think that there is such a rule.  To conclude this, the Electoral College is unfair. They take people's chances to change this country and do new things for us. If we had Mitt Romney, America might of had better imployment and a better system. We would of probulay had more money and had a better chance of going to college. But the Electoral College is unfair and had to take that away from Mitt and gave it to Obama. It's so outdated and unfair. For God's sake, its from 1700's! We need to get a better system of voting next time or people or just stop going to vote because they will know thay their votes mean nothing to the college and they will stop.

                "content": "Using the popular vote will indeed avoid many crisis that happened using the electoral system  The electoral college have messed up the voting system causing horrific crisis in the United States.  Having popular votes system will be arguably the best system to use for the election and towards the voting process. Using electoral votes will be unfair to voters when they are voting because of the simply winner-take-all basis of each and every one of the fifty states. Not only that it's unfair, it also causes many crisis in the United States dealing with this system alone and then eventually lead to dramatic chaos across the nation. Also, having the amount of electoral votes doesn't compare to the population of the actual state. Remember it is still one representative for the 500,000 people in Wyoming. Popular votes should be used in every political system no matter what situation it is. As the passage says, the argument against direct elections are spuriors at the best.  The writer states, \"The American people should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century; the system allows for much worse\" (Plumer).\u00a0 This disaster was not the first disaster to happen in the system.\u00a0 According to Plumer, the system has had much more effect and damage on the United States and this should not be repeated again.\u00a0 The writer also says, \"electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please\" (Plumer).\u00a0 This goes to show, not only is the electoral college unbeneficial, but they can be sneaky.\u00a0 The electoral college should be abolished because of the atrocious outcomes it is capable of doing to our government.  Not only is it indirect and unfair, but it can cause disaster to arise if there is a tie within the electoral voting process.  In 1968, a mere 41,971 votes would have caused a major deadlock in the election. The same thing happened again in 1976, if 5,559 votes in Ohio and 3,687 votes in Hawaii decided to vote differently. In both cases, and few thousand votes could have caused a serious disaster. History tends to repeat itself, so if the almost exact situation happened in the span of less than ten years, what makes you think it won't happen again?  If there is a tie in the electoral voting process it can cause a big disaster.  In The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong by Bradfor Plumer, Plumer explains that one of the best arguments against the Electoral College is that the rate of disaster is so high. In 2000, there was a elctoral crisis based upoun the Electoral College, because Al Gore recieved more individual votes, but George W. Bush still won the election.  Recently, students haven't felt safe in their schools. During a crisis, students could have classes online to keep students feeling safe.  If it is not being hacked into, technology and the internet is also known to malfunction often, which could lead to innumerable amounts of incidents.  ",

It doesn't hurt to ask for other's opinions and it's always a good thing to do at the end. We can achieve something or resolve the problem better if we get the help of others. Someone's opinion may shape your own opinion in a totally different way and it's smart to understand and use other's knowledge to your ability. Seeking help from multiple people can have great benefits such as having different opinions to build your own opinion, different experiences to build more knowledge, and also because it's always good to have people to rely on.\u00a0  Lots of people go through life based upon their own opinions, but truthfully, having multiple peoples' opinion leads to making better choices.  If you try and make an important decision based off of only your own opinion, you could face a truckload of consequences.  Having different opinions can help an individual a lot, even though you may not realize it. Your way of life can come from your parent's, grandparent's, and even your own opinion. Therefore It is very good to listen to your peers, they might have information that you never even imagined to think about, they can improve your character without you even knowing.  Everyone has their own personal opinion, hearing multiple opinions from many different people can be great advice and something\u00a0you can learn from when making a decision or choice. For example if someone had a bad experience at a restaurant their opinion on the restaurant is going to be way different than someone who had an amazing experience at that restaurant. There is no such thing as a right or wrong opinion, but you can always learn from what others have to say  Some people will feel positively about the topic while others feel negatively. People have their own opinions and their opinions are how they form an answer. For instance, if someone asks someone else for advice on where they should go for dinner, the action relies on the answer that the person gives. If they say that they should go to a certain restaurant, it could be because the person giving advice likes that restaurant. On the other hand, if the person asks multiple people, they will get a variety of answers because everybody has a different opinion. The more people that someone asks, the more answers that they will get. Therefore giving them a plethora of opinions to base their choice off of.  Everyone has an opinion, some are helpful, yet others just are going to make your life worse. You might ask why anyone would care about someone else's opinion, well it's hard to answer that question. You see, having multiple opinions can help limit the bias from the first opinion you received. Thus, why wouldn't you want to have multiple opinions, well it's quite simple, it's because people in our world are too scared to ask for others opinion or their advice. When asking for advice you are receiving wisdom, this wisdom can guide you to many great things, or it could lead you to absolute disaster. You will be guided into doing the wrong things in your life however you could stop all of that with a bit of advice. Having an opinion from one person can be very helpful, but just imagine if you could see both sides of your problem, thus leading you to obtain enough information on your problem and make the right choice.  but, I think its better to have other opinions because you can find new view points, you can have a outsiders opinion and you can discover more useful information that is relevant to the topic.  it can be very hard to get lots of opinions\u00a0and not be overly influenced and not listen to your own opinion.  Just as if it was math, the current knowledge is to be built on prior knowledge, it's no different for having an opinion. We are heavily influenced by the people around us, such as our parents or friends. When we combine the opinions of others on a situation, we can gather them up to make one solution. It's like adding pieces of a puzzle to make one grand masterpiece, we add the opinions of others to make our own opinion. There are multiple times when I have an opinion on something, such as a hobby, person, or situation and when other's share their opinions on it, sometimes I learn new things from them! It opens up a door to a new way of thinking and makes me more open minded. Asking for other's advises to build your own thought is a great way to learn what other's think and to also have a reliable idea.   Different people will have different ideas and options from their perspectives on different kinds of things. It is best to decide whether or not they have the same opinions or ideas, to see if they could bond to make new decisions. Everyone that that person picks from to get advice, could have the same opinions as others or different. Depending on people you trust may have better opinions then those of the people you do not trust. This person might think that the people they do care about or know more, have more ideas to pick from and approve from because they know and trust them most. ",

And while it is near voting times, I believed it's best for me to send you my side on this continuous debate to change your mind on the matter. The electoral college has had its share of arguments and I would like to make my side seen knowing I have quite a bit of logical arguments. Please read with an open mind.   Most people don't really care that their votes go to deciding who is on the electoral college  State Senator, please realize that this is not fair or justifiable. There may be an upside to the Electoral College, however, it is in my strongest opinion based on factual content that this is not a fair method and it should be abolished. Being empathetic for the ordinary voters of the United States would provide clarity for your opinion on the situation. Imagine if you were a general voter who did not get an official vote in the presidential election; you would feel cheated also. This is why I ask you to strongly consider these legitimate words.     The electoral college are made up of human beings and they will say no to ideas they don't like. I don't think that the fate of our country should be resting on the idea that if one person doesn't like someone they will reject the idea. Obviously, the electoral college might reject some ideas just because they don't like them.  To conclude, the Electoral College has caused many disastorous factors in our presidential campaigns. It has caused the wrong president to be elected, and it doesn't give our citizens much of a voice in the election. However, changing the system to popular vote for the president will give people a louder voice in this nation and it will show them that the government cares about their opinion. As the article, \"The Indefesible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid out defenses are wrong\" written by Bradford Plumer states, \"It's officual: The Electoral College is unfaor, outdated, and irrational. The best arguments in favor of it are mostly assertions without much basis in reality. And the arguents against direct elections are spurious at best.  Most people do not like the Electoral College because they are not directly voting for their canidate  \"It's hard to say this, but Bob Dole was right: Abolsi the electoral college!\" (Plumer, Source 2) and many others do agree with this statement because it rather true that we do so instead of let a bunch of monkeys run our states and country, but I am pretty sure that sometimes they could even do a better job than those in office right now. \".....over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now\" (Plumer, Source 2) every day as we continue that percentage continues to grow and that data was recorded in 2000.  (In source 2) Even presidents want to get rid of the electoral college that is saying something. People would rather have a direct election then the kind we have now and I agree. See when the people are voting for electors they dont know what that elector is going to vote for they can only hope for what he is going to vote for. (source 2) Paragraph 13 \"At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters.  In summation im in favor with the Electoral College for many reasons. After reading through this side and the opponing side of the argument I can honestly say that I prefer this method as it is. Yes there is a bad side to it but there is a bad side to everything and it shouldn't be big enough for anyone to oppose it.  For example, many young voters base their votes off of popular opinion, not what they think is actually right. If there was no Electoral College, the Nation could be in a lot of trouble because many votes would be casted off of popular opinion. So it is good to have some control over what happens and who becomes president, but I think having the full decision to vote for whomever, and have it count, is overdoing it. ",

                "content": "When making an important decision, lets say adopting a dog. People would want to ask multiple people if this would be a good idea or not. Adopting a dog is a big choice in someone's life and the person should seriously think this through. For example, lets say the person asks somebody who, in the past, had a dog who would always use the restroom in their house. That person probably would not recommend getting a dog. But then, if you ask a little kid who loves their dog very much and cuddles with it daily, they would recommend a dog. Now what if this individual had only asked the person with the bad dog? This person would now be denied their life time companion and emotional support. This exemplifies why people should ask multiple people before making an important choice. Now what if somebody wants to travel the world and they ask somebody about it. One person hated traveling, they were sick,got a bunch of stuff stolen from them,and got lost. This person hated traveling and would not recommend it to the person wanting to travel. This person had a bad past experience. But what if the person asked another person about traveling. This person absolutely loved traveling. They loved everything from the unique culture, to the flying in airplanes, to trying new things. This person had a good past experience with traveling and would recommend it to the person wanting to travel the world.  Not all advice given is automatically good. Let's say, for example, you are planning to redecorate your bedroom. Someone offers a neon-yellow pillow for your chair. You think to yourself, no way . Someone else tells you to hang up squares cut out from cardboard around the border of the entrance. You think, huh, that's not such a bad idea , until you ask one more person. They suggest that you declutter your shelf and invest in new curtains for a clean and bright look. Brilliant! The third suggestion is far better than the rest.  If someone were to ask one hundred different people what their favorite food is, they would probably get 100 different answers. This can be applied to advice because, if someone were to ask several different people for advice, they could get completely different advice from different people, and, chances are, some of the advice can really help instead of giving the person that needs advice useless information floating around. For a moment, imagine that it's time to vote for the President, and person 1 has no idea of who to vote for.  So person one goes back to his/her good friend person 2, then asks, \"Person two, who are you voting for?\" Person two replies with his/her chosen candidate, and person one asks several other people, and finally, person four tells person one about the candidate that he/she has chosen, and person one also votes for that person, because from what person four said, that person will do great things as President. If person one had just asked person two who to vote for, he/she never would've known that person four had chosen the candidate that was right for person one's beliefs. Another benefit to getting multiple people's solutions is that the different advice can be applied to the same problem until something works. For example, person one is trying to fix that pesky flat tire on his/her car, and then the advice that person two and person three gave. Because person one can't get person four to help, because person four is on vacation in Norway, person one decides to apply the advice of person two and person three to see if something works, and it turns out that person two had good advice once person one figured out what person two was trying to say. Basically, multiple answers can lead to the best answer and many solutions can be applied to the same problem until something works.  Because students are on vocations, this is their time to get caught up on their favorite hobbies and fun activities with their friends and one last thing they would want to think about is doing some sort of homework during their free relaxing time with family and friends moreover on a summer morning. For instance, lets say a student wants to hang out with friends on a saturday evening, but they remember they have a whole packet of work that was assigned to them before summer vocation and that by the end of summer before school starts, they have to finish it. The student will most liekly be worried and concerned about getting it over with and that means they will either cancell hanging out with friends and stay home doing random summer assigned homework on a saturday, but this is not the case when you know you are working with you teacher and that they will be able to walk you through all the work. Students surely worry less when they are working with a teacher on summer projects hence them doing something fun and relaxing in their free time sinc their teacher is available at any given point. School related projects or assignments are more easier to handle when your teacher is always there to work with you on that specific assigned assignment. As a result, students are much likely to enjoy their time away from school without anything bothering them for whatsoever case. Since students have already endured and served their time on the previous school year, they do not need any kind of aspect worrying them to the point where they have to stay home rather than them having fun and enjoying themselves and having a good time on a summer beach day while having fresh air and cooling off. Therefore, summer projects should be teacher-designed since students are not getting overwhelmed with what they need complete, but rather having some fun time with their friends and telling jokes and laughing them off with their relatives and maybe their pets who knows.  The more trials you have in an experiment, the more accurate your results will be. Let's use Generic_Name for an example. If Generic_Name had only listened to Generic_Name, then he would be up to his ankles in empty potato chip bags and energy drinks. It was because he asked multiple pterodactyls, that he was able to get the right advice. This doesn't mean that Generic_Name was planning on being messy or that Generic_Name was trying to scam Generic_Name. They were just trying to be good friends. From a scientific perspective, when planning a science experiment, you would want to have at least three trials. This is because something out of the ordinary could happen in your first trial and that it usually takes at least\u00a0three trials to recognize a pattern in the experiment.  If you are asking for advice - don't pick your favorite person. When I say this I mean people like your parents, your boss, etc. Although they could have good opinions, you might listen to them more than the other people who are trying to give you real feedback. Not only that but you don't want to have a person to lie to you and say that there was nothing wrong with your outfit or that your story didn't have confusing plot lines, when they both do. But on the other side of the feedback spectrum, don't pick someone who is going to crush your spirits. I once had a teacher in 6th grade that inspired me to learn more about the world's history and pushed me to learn. I even considered being a historian when I was older. Then, in 7th grade, I got a 72 year-old teacher who instead of having us learn about the Spanish-American War - stopped the whole class to look at pictures of his grandson. Don't get me wrong, I love looking at adorable picture of babies. But during the year, I lost my love for history and never thought about being a historian since. So what I'm trying to say is that you should pick someone you trust and that you respect and know that they will do the same for you.  First, in the passage it states that I had to feed and water the animals atleast two or three times a day. Second, if you are eighteen you could get drafted. That's another way to help. In the passage it stated that I could get drafted, so they told him to stay there and keep working with the Seagoing Cowboys. Third you also get to help work with the Seagpoing Cow boys. If you are a good worker and kind this would be a great job. If you like the Seagoing Cowboys you will like the fun.  When given the option to to stay at home to complete school, in opposition to going to school to complete school, nine out of ten students would agree in an instant to stay home. When further asking them their reasoning, the responses your most likely to receive consists of this : \"Im\u00a0going to go out and chill with my friends\", \"Im going to sleep in everyday\", \"im going to\u00a0go out shopping\", or flat out \"Im not going to do any work.\" The distance aspect of distance learning, when in the hands of people who initially didn't chose to go to school, will be full of procrastination and laziness. There can be measures applied to attempt to weed out the students that are straggling and try to help them develop better work habits, such as retake policies and extra help, but if a student doesn't care for what he or she is being told to work on, inevitably they will figure out a way around that work.  Even though students are the ones doing the project, teachers are the ones who understand the subjects that student should be learning. If you let a student pick a subject to work on over the summer, he could chose something very unnecessary that would have no impact in the students growth as an intellectual, he could say he is doing a science project that would ask how many hours he can play a video game before he gets hungry and eats food, or before he has to go to the bathroom. Teachers who got to know and understand their students throughout the year would know what they could be interested in and would work on during the summer. For students to be interested in something they want to understand how it works and find it fun to do. In order for students to not slack off and procrastinate they must find it interesting to them or they wont work on it. That is another thing that teachers must considered when giving out the projects that their students must do over the summer, if teachers assign the same project to everyone, many of them can get such projects done fairly quickly and not challenge them at all, having it done so soon they didn't learn anything for the project, or having all of them do the same project would just have them copy each other.  High school students must wake up quite early in the morning (typically before dawn), prepare for school, and drive through several minutes of traffic to arrive early: just to sit in various classrooms for ninety minutes at a time, completing classwork and receiving additional homework. How much more convenient it would be for some students to wake up whenever their body indicates it is adequately rested, get a healthy meal for breakfast, and work at their own pace in the comfort of their home. Such a relaxed schedule would be beneficial, especially for senior students in high school. Throughout the year, their minds are focused on completing college applications, applying for financial aid, sending in SAT scores and college transcripts. Taking online courses from home would allow those students to attend to their other responsibilities and manage classwork at their own convenience. In addition, some students, unfortunately, get bullied in school by their classmates. Studying at home would allow victims of bullying to be in their safe haven, away from those who oppress them and ridicule them for being different. Often times, high school students worry that colleges would view their decision to take online classes as lazy or careless, however, I have heard that colleges value how challenging the class is, the effort put in, and how well-rounded the student is. Furthermore, enrolling in online courses would improve the mental and physical health of students.  Having different points of views means to see how other people react and respond. When you get a new point of view you can make a pro and con check list. A pro and con check list is when you list all of the good things and list all of the bad things for that one opinion. These check list are very versatile, and can be used in many different ways. One example is, picking a restaurant\u00a0to eat at, for the pros you could say, the food tastes good, but the waits are long and the service is not that great. So now you decide you do not want to eat there and you go to an even better restaurant. Another example is, for spring break you want to go on vacation, but you also want to stay home and rest. When you make a list you can decide witch one you want to do most or the one with the most pros listed. Asking others for their opinions can persuade your choices and also give you ideas. Overall, having other peoples opinions can better your life as well as theirs ",

This applies in everyday life from then and getting advice is not the exception. Everybody has different beliefs, experience and ways to do things so it's hard to find one person that exactly understand you to the point of giving you advice perfectly.  People can be complicated, one may never know what is going on in another's life. Every person is different, no one is the same as the next in any way, shape, or form. Taking classes from home would help eliminate those who are uncomfortable in the environment an everyday school would have, such as those with anti-social tendencies or anxiety. Having so many students in just one building causes many conflicts, whether they be through two students, or between a student and their teacher. Within a school, it is inevitable for there to be an issue depending on how one may react and feel.  To finish off, when seeking multiple opinions it can help someone make a better choice. As said in paragraph one, throughout life people have different views on situations and how to resolve them beneficially. As restated in paragraph two, people in life are faced with many challenges. Knowing others struggle can help bring together different ways to handle a decision. Lastly, when my peer was faced with a problem she sought out help, this brought her to a happier place. She is now better than she ever thought she could be. Making a decision shouldn't be done alone, we need to use the people around us to help guide our journey.  Life contains many differences, includes positive and negative things, truthful or untruthful. Some people said emotions are never lie. We could figure out the statue of someone by looking at their face, and that's true. However, life is something really complicated, sometimes things in front of you don't mean like what you think. Likewise, even though the expression from people face is the most authenic, when they are trying to hide their feelings, we literally cannot know their real emotions. The changing of teenager is issue that causes headache for parents, their characters aren't the same like before, their emotions are changed. Both of them could not find the common speech, and push them further each other. That is the moment, the childrens easily fall in the darkness. For real instance, children or students aren't agree about their parent's thinking, or the education from school completely. Most of them don't say it out, or talk back. It's really affects about effective in studying and their plans in the future.  Dr. Huang also explains that \"the facial expressions for each emotion are universal\" reguardless of the desgree of expression, (D'Alto). Finally, the fear of more computer based activities is rapidly squashed by the contradiction that being more aware should envoke more human interaction, not lesson it.  The article states that the technology associates each emotion with \"characteristic movements of the facial muscles\" and then uses those movements to calculate the spectrum of emotions based on their facial display. But some people show emotions in various ways, and the technology most likely cannot accomodate for the many different ways people express the same emotion. For example, if a student has a resting face that seems generally happy, the system might confuse this dazed face as a satisfied face and think that the student is happy with their lessons when they are actually confused or not paying attention. In the same way, if a student has a resting face that looks naturally sad, the system may think they are unhappy with their lessons, even if the student feels they are learning a lot. A lot of students also try to hide their emotions, like frusteration or sadness, with a happier look on their face, and even though the article states that the system can detect a \"false smile\", it cannot always be accurate as a person may be good at hiding their emotions and displaying a genuine smile. Therefore, since technology is not always accurate and because human beings are so various in the way they behave, the technology would not be useful in a classroom where it may misread a student's state of mind and lead them in the wrong path of education.  Not every person has the same lifestyle as the next, everyone has their own differing personalities and character traits that may or may not clash with others  making a choice is difficult than it already is, and making the best choice does not seem like it is any more luxurious. Some people might be able to decisions\u00a0at the speed of light without getting any opinions, while others might need some more opinions in order to make their decision. Life is all about making choices everyday and people have to accept the results that come out of it. Some people might be more carefree about it, while others might need to think more before they make a choice. Wanting to make the best choice is not selfish at all and is just a part of life. Wanting the credibility, different ideas and views from people is just another way of making the best choice. Therefore, seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice because of credibility, people have different ideas, and people have different views. ",

                "content": "Social interactions and collaboration with peers is a beneficial learning aspect that cannot be accessed at home.  Being able to socialize comfortably and confidently is an important skill for success, especially if your career choice requires you to do so. People usually start building their social skills when they first start school, where they interact and communicate with their peers. Students miss out on this opportunity when they only learn by clicking and scrolling on a screen in the vicinity of their home. People often get comfortable with isolation and adapt to being alone and never learn how to communicate properly with others. Lacking these skills can effect the long distance learners' performance at job interviews and daily tasks that requires them to speak to others around them. This could result in them missing out on the opportunity to flourish in the career field they studied hard for and the opportunity to develop good relationships with other people.  Through online schooling, students would not be allowed opportunities to interact with their peers, inhibiting the development of their social skills. Instead of collaborating with their classmates, students enrolled in online schools would have to complete assignments independently, limiting the sharing of ideas. Without the opportunity to share and discuss ideas, students would not be able to develop significant social skills, which include patience, open-mindedness, and the ability to peacefully collaborate.  Without such skills, the students would be at a great disadvantage in future endeavors requiring teamwork, which are commonly presented throughout adulthood.  With the loss of fellow classmates it can make an impact greater than most people think. Humans are social creatures which allows us to thrive when working and collaborating with one another. Now when your taken out of that environment and placed in an environment that forces you to do all the work alone it destroys your work speed and makes it far more difficult to process and absorb information because you don't have the different perspectives or incites your classmates could have given you. Not having classmates also could make it harder to interact with unfamiliar people because when your in class your always meeting and socializing with new and unique\u00a0people, now being taken out of that your no longer exposed to any of these interactions meaning you would have to relearn these social skills which could be very challenging as a teenager which could lead to worse problems like being socially awkward  Both of those ideas, however, are false. Most high school students do not put in the effort to dress nicely for school everyday already, they would rather be comfortable then look nice. Through video chatting, students have the opportunity to interact with their peers and teachers, everyone needs social interaction and distance learning takes that into account. Many students find it easier to learn while sitting at a desk or table, both of which are very common in any household, therefore, students lazing around in bed while learning is highly unrealistic.  However, the social experience between a student and his peers in the classroom can help the student grow as an individual with good social skills.  Socializing is something that some shy students struggle with. Extracurricular activities give students a chance to make more friends and socialize  One's social skills might develop more and more as time progresses and they're surrounded by situations where they are prompted to socialize with other students. Also, a student might find his or her niche, where they belong, who they really are, what they do or don't like. I can't seem to put my finger on it, but there is a difference in learning where you sit behind a screen and listen to mind numbing concepts all day, rather than sitting in a engaging classroom where you ask questions, work out problems, and get a more hands on experience.   Projects have always been a way for students to collaborate with their peers. It may not seem like much, but projects teach teamwork, leadership, and knowledge skills. Projects also emphasize the importance of making friends and compromising with others to achieve success. Learning from home deprives students from working with their peers. The only way a student gets to be in contact with another person is if a student is video conferencing a teacher or staff member.  To summarize, because students get to socialize with people they never got the opportunity to talk to before, experience new things and get taught new skills, and impact the community as well as themselves, I believe extracurricular activities should definitely be included at our school. They are a very bright part of anyone's day, something that a kid could look forward to on a boring Monday. Also, they could find out new things they didn't have a clue about. A teen gets to talk to others near their age group who started out just being part of a crowd, but because they met them while playing the part of Juliet, they turned into a best friend. Additionally, we get to help the whole state while having a incredible time. So whether it's the applause of an audience at a play, the encouraging comment of a friend on a picture, or the announcement of a score it took a team effort to achieve, the activity that got someone there made a mark on their heart.

                "content": "For example, say you need advice on whether or not to get a dog or a cat as a pet. What would happen if you did seek advice? What would happen if you didn't? What kind of opinions would you become aware of?  You are unsure whether a dog or cat is a right pet for you. You decide to ask the advice from multiple others by different sources. One person you ask is completely against dogs; this person is being biased as they are telling you how they believe cats are better than dogs, only because they have one. They list the negative qualities of dogs, and list the positive qualities of cats, something you consider.  The same thing in the above paragraph happens with a dog lover, who advises you get a dog, which in their opinion, is better than a cat. This person has a dog, and is being biased aswell. This enables you to get different opinions on your question by seeing both sides of the story. The dog lover, like the cat lover, now tells you the negative qualities of cats, then the positive qualities of dogs. You can now make a better choice on which pet to get that suits you.  Now, say you didn't ask for any other opinion and decide to get a dog. Since you didn't seek out others advice, you find that this dog needs too much exercise, is always hungry, and doesn't leave you alone. You are unhappy with your choice since you didn't seek out all the possible information from others.  When you get stuck on something whether or not it is to buy a cat or buy a dog. You always ask someone their opinion right? If you don't, you really should it can help you make great decisions like, whether or not should you buy that cat or chose that job.  In the modern world today, there are many things that could distract students such as electronics, pets, noises, etc. Imagine trying to work on a paper and all of a sudden the cat jumps up on the table and knocks over the diet cola that was sitting in a cup on the table; you would not only have to get up and clean the mess, but you would also have to move the cat elsewhere taking up precious time that could be spent working on an assignment. With online classes, everything is done at home. A student could be taking a test online and could hear just the tiniest noise and very easily get distracted. It is evident with the reasons I provided, why online classes provide such a high risk for distractions at home.  Someday someone might thank them for helping out. I think people who are sick would really appreciate what we are trying to do for them. Also pets could catch diseases that are in the air. When we leave food behind it creates maggots and maggots find a way to get into your house and when you at least expect it somehow they will end up in your body and start eating your flesh that's why we have to pick up after ourselves. Also when we go to school some people leave the food on the tables and it creates flies and mouse's and we don't want to a cafeteria that has animals that are infected with rabies or some other diseases. And I think that's why we should have community service.  The trusted person helping you can show you how the other person might be feeling. Sometimes knowing how they feel can change your point of view on things. The friend or family member can inform you on what you did wrong. Even if the opposing person hurt your feelings, there is a high chance you have hurt them as well! If you are confused on what the problem is they can show you what it is or how it started. For me, I need to understand how the problem started before I resolve it. Understanding how the other person felt, knowing what the problem is, and realizing what you did wrong are important things the trusted people helping you can do for you to make a better choice.   Lets say that their is someone in the school that never likes doing homework, you may ask that person to do some community service like taking care of something. The person at first may think like why do I have to take care of something just because I don't do my homework. If you tell them they have to volunteer in a dog shelter they wont want to do it but if you also tell them they are in charge of everything and that if anything goes wrong it would be their fault. The student will probably get scared and do everything it takes to do everything good. After community service is over he will probably be a better student by doing his homework. If the student probably did change he would probably ask to see if he could do other community service.  The FACS will pick up emotions that a student is feeling and teachers, parents, and or consoulers will be able to get the help that that particular student aqquires. \"To an expert, faces don't lie; these muscle clues are sometimes used to spot when a \"smiling\" politicain or celebrity isn't being truthful.\" This same concept can work with students too. If a student is giving off a false emotion than that student really feels; the FACS can determine the actual emotion the student is feeling. If teachers and parents realize the actual feelings and emotions someone feels, he or she will be able to provide more comfort in the act of helping towards that individual.  asking multiple people for their opinion helps you make a better choice to decied what best suits you, opens your eyes to different points of view, or possibilities. You now know the pros and cons for your question, you may even be able to relate to an opinion more, helping you decide on an option. In the end, you happily go home with a cat.\u00a0  Lets say you want to buy a dog, your first dog. You dont know much about taking care of dogs so you ask a few people their opinion on your choice, your family loves the choice even though they never had a dog. So you go to ask your friends they say, \"Yeah! You totally should do that, it would be so cute.\" Now you go ask a experienced co-worker he says, \" Your dog can be one of the best things that happened in your life but you have to find the right moment, because if you work to much and cant take care of it its not worth it to you and your dog. Also it is a lot of money and time, you have to pay almost 100 dollars a month just to feed it on top of your time, taking it on walks in the morning, middle of the day, and at night. It just not might be fit for you right now.\" So you take that into you pile of opinions, sure its fun and cute but maybe your not ready for it, its not fair to the dog. This is also another reason why you should ask multiple people their opinions  Everyone deals with things that others probably don't know about. With FACS a student could come into class like Charlie and no one knows about his frustrations so they try to do their normal jokes and games with him. If a student ever comes into class not feeling the best or not wanting to be bothered, FACS could sense that and instead of people messing with that kid or having that kid be bothered, that child could have the option of being away from everyone while the child cools down. That could stop the child from being involved in a physical altercation or any altercations at that. ",

This allows students to learn in the comfort of their own home, without having to transport to a private, or public school. This may be convienent for parents who work on a busy schedule, allowing them to choose when and where they want their chilldren to learn.  Although online schooling my be beneficial to some children, it may harm their future.  Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. Online or video conferencing is when students and teachers communicate through long distances through the use of technology. Students would be able to learn without the need to be in a classroom with other people. This would are able to help them learn more frequently and function more with the help of this learning capability. Students would be able to personally talk to teachers if there having trouble with work in class.  Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. This is a very beneficial   Although, others believe that distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by online or video conferencing is not beneficial. Others believe that distance learning wouldn't be beneficial for students because the youth is too irresponsible of holding themselves accountable for having such a tremendous responsibility.  For the past few hundred years, school systems have consisted of one specific format, where students go to a place of learning and are taught by teachers. But now, with easier access to better technology, this school system is changing. Some schools are offering distance learning as an option to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. This new system has gained both positive and negative attention.  Did any of the schools you attended as a child offer distance learning? Would you be interested in participating in distance learning? Schools are now offering distance learning as an option for their students. Distance learning allows students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. Schools believe that there are benefits to distance learning, however there are various problems with the system of distance learning  By offering distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home, they'll be able to continue their learning while not having to worry about falling behind or having to attend school later into the summer.  For some students schooling from home is their only option. For example some students have health issues preventing them from attending public school. They could be too sick or vulnerable to be around all the other students. Although for many of these students they wish to attend public school with their peers to feel like every other student their age. The distance learning program would be giving these students the opportunity to study among their peers in a public school setting. While some may say the video conferencing would be a distraction to students, it would be giving students who are unable to attend public school physically the chance to learn the way all other students who can attend public school physically do.   Offering distance learning through online classes and video conferencing can help a lot in a student's path of education because it keeps them safe from breakout diseases and increases their productivity by making them more comfortable. The students face far less stress at home than they do at home. This results in a spike of productivity and even makes their grades better. Online classes should definitely be introduced to more schools because it is a really useful tool in helping the student become a better learner and person by teaching discipline and time management skills.  As the modern world advances in technology and media, schools need to advance with it. An outdated education system leaves little room for student growth and success; it can damper the effects of the hard work that both teachers and students put into school. However, this waste of efforts can be easily avoided by means of the updating of school policies. For example, it is growing increasingly more common for schools to offer distance learning as an option for their students. Distance learning allows students to engage in online classes and video conferencing as a way of learning from home. Therefore, students would be able to attend classes virtually from their own homes. ",

                "content": "In 1976 the face looked like a face. In 1998 it started to not look like a face at all. In 2001 it just looked like a rock. So i believe that it was not created by aliens but that it was just something the olanet had made itself. This has certainly got the attention of the people.  The \"Face on Mars\" is not a face. If you look at the pictures from 1976, and 1998, and 2001 and in the text it says that the photo from 2001 is the most recent photo that NASA has. It still looks nothing like a face so since the 2001 picture is the most recent it shows that it is just a natural landform. It is just a natural landform. On Mars there are natural landforms everywhere and the fade away. Here on earth natural landforms are created everyday.  When the face on Mars was originally captured, there was no such thing. The article explains that when the picture was originally captured in 1976, the camera quality was not great. For example the text states, \"Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo.\" So, when given a better camera quality than in 1976, the face on mars no longer looks like a defined face. Although the quality of the camera is a great support, there are many other explanations that put an end to conspiracy theorists.  The first picture that was taken of the face on Mars was taken in 1976 and the quality back then was not as good as it is now. The picture that was taken in 2001 was a higher quality picture and scientists figured out that is was just a mesa and not a sign of any ancient civilization on Mars. For example the camera used in 1976, spanned 43 meters compared to the camera NASA used in 2001 spanned 1.56 meters. In the picture of 1976, the shadows that were present that day formed an illusion that made it seem like there was a face. In paragraph two of the article \"Unmasking the Face on Mars\" it says that, \"Scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia, only this one had unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh.\"  In 1976, the Viking 1 spacecraft was orbiting the planet of Mars, and it was taking new pictures for all of mankind to see. As it was passing over a strip of Mars called Cydonia, it snapped a picture that would cause an uproar in space exploration. This new picture showed what seemed to be a human face. A few days later NASA reveled these pictures for the world to see; it was an instant hit  n paragraph 10 it says,\" ...43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo.\" This shows that the photo didn't give very compelling evidence that there was life on Mars. soon later NASA and their supporters claimed that this face is just an act of nature is because of the 1998 Global Surveyor spacecraft. This new spaceship passed over the red planet to take pictures of the \"face on Mars\". The pictures were ten times better than the last pictures of Cydonia this time. The new photos clearly showed a landform on Mars and not a man.  Mars has been a planet that we have been exploring for many years. We have discovered many abnormal objects on the planet. In 1976, we took a picture of the region Cydonia, and we found something that seemed to look like a human face. Our eyes are adapted to recognizing faces and that is why we recognized the face on Mars more easily. Higher quality images that were taken in 2001 show that the face on Mars is no sign of ancient civilization on Mars but in fact a mesa.  In 1976 NASA released a photo of a landform on Mars resembling a human face. Not everyone was easily convinced that it was only just a landmass though. Conspiracy theorists believed that it was, \"Bona fide evidence of life on Mars.\" In the article \"Unmasking the Face on Mars,\" the author, Garvin, believed that it was only a mesa.  And my explanation for that is because if they want to have a more clearer picture then they should take another one up there. And again they might even get an even bettere and bigger because of the technology we have today. It might be even in high definition so that they can see if thats actually a face or if its just a mountain with craters. But they might get me wrong and thats ok but as long as they have a better camera to explain how or what i'm right about. Like in the beginning of this article it said that they had take pictures in 1976, 1998, and in 2001 but all of those pictures are on cameras that make pictures blury and in order to see if the picture was actually a face they had to do something to make that picure clearer than it shows.  In 1976, Viking 1 took photos of Mars and found a huge rock formation that remebled a human head with shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth.  This was soon to be known as the \"Face on Mars\".   The Apollo 11 mission was just seven years old! To attach a high-powered camera to a space shuttle was very challenging at the time. I still hold to my belief that, during the 1976 mission, it was either the fault of the Viking I for holding a bad angle for the camera and causing blurriness, or the camera's fault for simply not being powerful enough. The 1976 photo spans just 43 meters per pixel, which at the time was a very high resolution, but now is considered very low. All in all, the Viking I photo of the Face on Mars is forty years old and must not be taken as seriously as it once was. ",

                "content": "The Electoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment of the Senate decreed in the Constitution.\" This shows that large states can sway the whole election, while small states don't make a dent on it, without the Electoral College in place. Thus, using it allows smaller states' votes to matter in the election, while eliminating large states' advantage over them  \"The Electoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states (by population) lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment of the Senate decreed in the Constitution  the electoral college restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states by population lose by virtue of the mal- apportionment of the senate decreed in the constitutuion  There is also number 4 where the Electoral College \"restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states lose virtue of the mal-apportionment of the Senate decreed in the Constitution\"  Altough many downfalls, \"The Electorial College restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states... lose\" and \"avoids the problem of elections in which no one recieves a majority of the votes cast,\"(Source Three, paragragh 21 and 22).  In \"Source 3: In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President\", author Richard A. Posner explains that the Electoral College \"restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment of the Senate decreed in the Constitution.\" The Electoral College gives larger states more attention from presidential candidates as opposed to a smaller state. Posner continues the idea with \"the most thoughtful voters should be the ones to decide the election.\" To break it down, voters who pay close attention to the campaign will be the most thoughtful voters and they will recieve the most attention from the candidates. This reduces the amount of disputes because the presidential candidates will decide on who to give the most attention to.  The Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have a trans-regional appeal. This means if the voter is from the south, they have no reason to campaign heavily in those sates. Instead they can spend more time in states that need a little more convincing fot the candidate to gain their vote. It also restores some of the weight in the political balance that a large states loses by virtue of the mal-appotrionment of the Senate decreed in the constitution  On the other hand having the electoral votes may not be such a bad thing. The Electoral College avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast. The Electoral College also restore some of the weight in the political balance that large states.  \"Under the electorial college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president.\" (Paragraph 10). In actuality, voters don't directly vote for the president when it comes to the electoral college. Although the Electoral College \"restores some of the weight in the polititcal balance that large states lose by virtue of mal-apportionment\", (paragraph 21) voters don't have the right to control whom their electors are said author Bradford Plumer. Voting for a group of electors doesn't always mean that they'll vote for the candidate in which you favor. This can have a huge affect on the reputation of the Electoral College itsself.  In large states, where this a majority of either republican or democrats, voters may think that if they are in the minority, and the other party will surely win the election, what's the point of voting. If there was no Electoral College, the votes that they put in could contribute to the greater pool of that parties voters, while with Electoral College the votes are pointless and basically disapear. That, to me, is robbing the citizens of the U.S. of thir right to vote. According to Richard A. Posner, the Electoral College restores some of the weight that the large states hold in a presidental election. However, the large states may not have all of one party and those other votes can really make a difference. ",

                "content": "I think students who have less than a B average should be able to do sports, because doing sports teaches us students responsibility, and self discipline  It would help them become more independent and self reliant. The students already have to do what the teacher says during the school year, so this would make for a great chance for them to do what they need to on their own time. It would also teach them to be responsible for themselves\u00a0and for their own work. For example, if the student understands that they are no longer in a classroom setting where the teacher explains everything to them, they will conclude they must rely on themselves to complete the task at hand. Which would lead to more independence rather than depending on the teacher.  This is because they are constantly helping people out, and doing the right thing. This way they will feel good about themselves, and will be a better person overall. I am a boy scout, and i always participate in activities such as, help cleaning up a state park, and help cleaning up the Connecticut River. After i do these things, i feel ready good about myself because i did the right thing, and helped out our community a lot. Furthermore, scientist have shown that students who do community service have a better chance of having a happy life than people who don't, because you will always feel good about yourself and how you have helped your community.  As someone already participating in high school sports and tutoring my peers, I think it is safe to say from my perspective that little things like this do make a huge difference in who you are as a person and as a studen  If you let a student's grade decide if a student can or can't compete in sports, you can be holding them back from healthy exercise and keep them from building confidence. Exercise keeps students healthy and when a student competes in sports, they are exercising. Every gym teacher I've ever had has always told us how daily exercise is important and I've seen many commercials that say growing kids and teens need at least one hour of exercise each day to keep physically fit and healthy. Sports also build confidence. When a team wins, it boosts a person's confidence. When you are confident, you feel that you can do anything and succeed. Sports provide healthy exercise and confidence to students, but if you keep this rule, you'll be depriving it from us.  It is privilege to be able to participate in school sports and activities cause you learn more things that are useful in the future and help you gain physical strength on some levels  Students may feel they are being rewarded with a little free time by having their cell phones out. If this opportunity is given 99% of students may do better in school. Many may think this just gives students a way to have their cell phones out without getting in trouble for it. However, students are actually very responsible and may do the right thing.  And also i think that is important to do good things for the community sense we live and are the community  Most of the advice that you will need it things like school or ideas.  You can even get advice on which classes to take next year or what sports you want to do or how you can convince your parents to let you do the sport that you want to do.  The best way to get better at sports is to seek advice from people who have played it for a long time.  Most sports like basketball or wrestling are just experience dominates.  In basketball if you are guarding someone with a lot of experience then it is going to be a lot harder because they already know the sport like the back of their hand.  It is always the best to seek advice from older players.  Because they have played the sport longer than you have and know how most people play.  The more advice that you seek from them the more answers you will get to your questions.  These students need to be prepared for college and the real world outside of school, such as the work force. For example, if a child wanted to play soccer you would not just sit them in front of a television and watch soccer games. This might be a good way to teach them the general idea of what soccer is but they will never be able to learn the skills that are necessary in the game. That child will never learn how to pass, shoot, kick, or even have the social skills to communicate with his team mates. This goes the same for any other activity. The teachers in this school are treating there students just like this child. If they just give them the summer project and tell them to complete it they will never learn the skills of self-management and creativity that they would develop while design their own summer projects. These are valuable skills that students will need later in their own life time. ",

                "content": "The age of computers is inescapable, but it doesn't have to be. Instead of computer analyzed emotional connection, people should put their phones down and ask each other how they are. Not every person wants their emotions analyzed, especially in schools. Students bonds with teachers are simply student to teacher; a child must trust an adult before they talk about their feelings. Computer facial technology might be helpful, but not in schools. This technology falls flat in the category of connection. Don't take the easy way out, instead of analyzing emotions with a computer, ask someone how they are. If a student looks upset, sit down and talk with them. Show someone they are valuable and deserve one on one human interaction  If a student is feeling sad or feeling stressed about home problems which they are trying to conceal, then the technology detects this and displays it for the teacher and the electronic lesson to see. This is an invasion of privacy, as the teacher does not need to know about a student's homelife or about their feelings outside the classroom. A teachers job should be to monitor how their students are feeling about their lessons, not about how their students are feeling about their life outside of school, and since this technology could pick up on digressing feelings, it should not be used in a classroom where a student's internal feelings are revealed to a teacher. Therefore, using Facial Action Coding could end up being an invasion of privacy that should not be introduced to the classroom.  It can read a total of six emotions with some branches coming off of those emotions. The six emotions are stated in the quote,\" Eckman has classified six basic emotions - happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness - and then associated each with characteristic movements of the facial muscles.\" The machine is able to determine whether a student is in distress or not thus telling the teacher to help the student out with the problem that they are facing. The teacher would be able to help the student cope and deal with their emotional sadness or anger and tell them how to deal with it in order to assist them in getting through it. This is not the end though of what this incredible machine can do for a school.  Their job is to connect and work with students. When introducing a computer system, students may realize they are just another task to be completed in the work place. Every year, students are analyzed to see where they place on the national benchmark for their education, they take standardized tests to see how much they know, they do hearing tests and eye tests, but a computer has yet to analyze them to see how happy they might be. If computers are introduced to read emotions, students may feel like they are just a number or rank of emotions. If students go to their counselors, they want to be talked to and connected with. Bringing in a computer can divide the connection from child to adult. The child may feel alienated and refuse to converse with the adult. This computer may seem like a helpful tool, but it destroys the importance of human connection.  The FACS will pick up emotions that a student is feeling and teachers, parents, and or consoulers will be able to get the help that that particular student aqquires. \"To an expert, faces don't lie; these muscle clues are sometimes used to spot when a \"smiling\" politicain or celebrity isn't being truthful.\" This same concept can work with students too. If a student is giving off a false emotion than that student really feels; the FACS can determine the actual emotion the student is feeling. If teachers and parents realize the actual feelings and emotions someone feels, he or she will be able to provide more comfort in the act of helping towards that individual.  In today's world, students are filled with many emotions, some too difficult for even parents to decode. The rollercoaster of feelings that a teenager endures in a day is confusing and complex. But with newly found technology, it may be easier now for the emotions of students' to be understood and assisted, if needed. The revolutionary Facial Action Coding System allows computers to scan and analyze the feelings of a human, alive or painted, and is a very valuable tool to comprehend student's emotional expressions.  like its says in paragraph 6 \"Imagine a computer that knows when you're happy or sad\". For example if you smile when a web ad appears on your screen a similar ad might follow. But if you frown the next ad will be different \"A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored \"Most human communication is nonverbal including emotional communication\" noted Dr. Huang \"So computers need to understand that too  In schools, there are counselors, coaches, teachers, and friends who can identify if a student is not doing well and get them the help they need. Without interacting in person, it is hard to tell if a student is struggling and in need of help. This type of attention could be the difference between life or death in extreme cases, and should not be overlooked. In fact, more and more schools are placing a greater emphasis on mental illness and stress. Schools often encourage students to engage in de-stressing activities such as yoga, meditation, or sports. Because the focus of distance learning is purely learning, there is no emphasis on the well-being\u00a0of students, a practice that could lead to detri mental consequences for students in the long-run.  If a student shows confusion or discontent, it may be able to pick that up and show the teacher specific students that need help. The teacher could take the student aside and ask if they need help, and then adjust their learning accordingly. Another way this technology could help struggling students is to set them up with tutors that are doing well in the class. If a student is excited to learn consistantly during that class period, they could be sat next to a struggling student in order for the one not doing as well to recieve help from a peer. The ability to read emotions in the classroom would help students who are struggling tremendously.  Shyness is something students have a lot of. In fact, almost 60 percent of students have some shyness in them if not at all. This shyness can affect if not ruin the class, making new friends, and even doing classwork with other students when needed. Online classes can solve this as they can give a sense of friendliness towards strangers. ",

They have their schedule built around their car and are constantly being time constrained because of it. The effect greenhouse gases have on the Earth is huge and has not stopped. In order to help the Earth in this parituclar topic, this action would be miraculous. Not only do many people become lazy and very unhealthy because of cars, but they also take for granted what they can do without them. Hiking and other activities are missed out on the daily because of these vehicles. Many people can accomplish new goals and set new goals if it were not for certain transportation methods.       \u00a0       \u00a0        \u00a0     As you can see, there are many advantages to limiting car usage, such as, limiting the amount of pollution there is, lowering the risks of getting into, or even causing a wreck, and even something as simple as making it a more peaceful enviroment to live in, not only for yourself, but for others around you. Our world, and daily lives would be affected in great ways, in more cities, and even more countries, participated in lessing the amount of car usage.        \u00a0   Many people throughout the world, would agree that car usage plays a significant role in daily lives. Although some may argue it plays an important role or a not so important role, the limitation of car usuage would be a very helpful thing for everyone, and the world we are surrounded by.  Although cars make everyday life easier, lessening the use of them could potentially \"save the world.\"  From Monster trucks to Volkswagen Beetles, all automobiles are created to make life easier for people from all corners of the Earth. Many people start up their cars everyday without a second thought, whether trekking across the street or across the country. Others believe that cars are ruining the Earth, and put effort toward decreasing their car's \"footprint\" on the environment.  there are many advantages of limiting the use of cars. Not only does it promote and improve other forms of transportation, but it also decreases the amount of smog and air pollution, which are harming our environment.   have you ever heard of the greenhouse affect, global warming and air pollution? the abundant usage of cars have a large affect on those vital things in our environment .  Cars are beneficial when it comes transportation, but they can cause harm to the environment as well. Pollution is a major problem in the today's world, and with the number of cars that are in use everyday it will only become worse. Smog or any other type of pollution can cause a city or even a country to take action. Such a Paris, Fance, who put a ban on driving to reduce pollution in their city, which rivaled Beijing, China, known as the one the most polluted cities in the world, as said in source 2. This strenghens the problems that cars pose on the world, these problems can lead to delivery companies losing money because the ban was put up and won't be lifted until the smog is gone. In addition, more information about car pollution can be found in source 1. There it talks about how cars are the \"linchpin\" of suburbs, and how they're \"a huge impediment to current efforts to drasticallly reduce greenhouse gas emissions.\" In some places this is slowly resolving itself; places such as the United States have seen a drop in miles driven per person since it's peak in 2009. Sociologists believe that, \"it will have beneficial implications carbon emissions and the environment\"(Source 4). This indicates that, while it is a major issue it is not impossible to solve it.  Cars have always been apart of American culture. From the \"...birth place of the Model T;\u00a0the home of Detroit; the place where Wilson Pickett immortalized \"'Mustang Sally'\"(The End of Car Culture, Rosenthal) Cars and automobils have impacted our everyday lifes from going to the store to hanging out with friends, but car usage has been stedily decreesing and for all the right reasons.  when we look at studies we find that when people use their cars immensely, there is a harmful effect in our atmosphere, also reffered to as The Greenhouse Effect.

                "content": "Some issues still remain for the exploration, however NASA has already started preparing solutions. The heated state of the planet may be an issue, but NASA is studying a resolution. Paragraph 7 reads, \"For example, some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface and have lasted for three weeks in such conditions\" (The Challenge of Exploring Venus). This new technology created could lead to a long-lasting basis for human life, yet another reason exploring Venus is a brilliant idea. Modern technology is too fragile for the harsh heat of the planet, but with some older computers, that as well could survive on Venus. Paragraph 7 reads, \"The thought of (mechanical) computers existing in those days may sound shocking, but these devices make calculations by using gears and levers and do not require electronics at all. Modern computers are enormously powerful, flexible, and quick, but tend to be more delicate when it comes to extreme physical conditions\" (The Challenge of Exploring Venus). This is yet another piece of technology on Earth and prepared for Venus  This means there is a worthy reason to explore Venus; to discover another habitable planet. Along with successful life on Venus, our modern technology could also survive the planet. Paragraph 5 states, \"Imagine a blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the roiling Venusian landscape. Just as our jet airplanes travel at a higher altitude to fly over many storms, a vehicle hovering over Venus would avoid the unfriendly ground codnitions by staying up and out of their way\" (The Challenge of Exploring Venus). Moreover, if airplanes are already in existence, new aircrafts would need to be slightly adjusted to suit the conditions of Venus. The author's claim is supported in this quote because this is another reason Venus is worth exploring. The technology needed is already almost perfect for the planet, therefore not a problem NASA would have to approach.  NASA's advancements for Venus exploration are promising, \"For example, some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface and have lasted for three weeks in such chaos,\" (7). Humans would not be able to use the most advanced technology, but durability is the goal, \"By comparison, systems (mechanical computers that use gears and levers to calculate) that use mechanical parts can be made more resistant to pressure, heat, and other forces,\" (7). If humans were to only hover over Venus, the possibilites are limited. Humans and technology have to be as close as possible. Technology that could last for a few weeks is enough to vastly expand our knowledge. Mechanical computers are now obsolete, but in Venus would be a valuable tool, just like the other electonics being made. Researchers have worked tirelessly to continue making Venus exploration a reasonable reality.  The author gave an entire paragraph about the new technologies that NASA is working on to explore Venus, even though his main idea is about why we should send shuttles to Venus. In the article it states \" Another project is looking back to an old technology called mechanical computers. These devices were first envisioned in the 1800s and played an important role in the 1940s during World War II\". This entire quote has nothing to do with the topic whatsoever, which shows that the author was gettting side tracked. One reading just this quote from the article would most likely think this article is about computers,and not why humans should explore Venus.  They explain that NASA has a theory that sending anything electronic to it will die off within hours, where as sending parts from the 1800's - 1940's won't. I know this becaues in the text it states that, \"NASA is studying other approches to studying Venus. For example, some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface and have lested about three weeks...These devices were first envisiond in the 1800's and played an important role in the 1940's during the war...but, these devices made calculations by using gears and levers without electricity...By comparison, systems that use mechanical pats can be made more resistant to pressure, heat, and other forces\"(paragraph 7). This means that hypothetically NASA could send older tech and find a way to uncover more information.  They are considering a blimp-like vehicle that would float above the suface of Venus to meet the challenges presented. This blimp would avoid the poor conditions of the Venusian landscape by floating some thirty miles above the surface. Conditions around the blimp would still be slightly hot, but the pressure and toxicity would be similar to that on Earth. These conditions are not ideal, but they would be sufficient enough to study Venus further. Another one of NASA's ideas is to use mechanical computers to study Venus. These mechanical computers do not require electronics, and they would be more resistant to the poor conditions of the surface. These new innovations in the study of Venus is what makes the dangers tolerable and the study worthy.  The passage later explains examples of NASA's approached to studying Venus when the author says, \"Another project is looking back to an old technology called mechanical computers. These devices were first envisioned in the 1800s and played an important role in the 1940s during World War II.\" The idea of looking back on past resources to help the studying of Venus would help the process. This past project is a key tool that helps support that Venus should be studied even though it can be extremely dangerous. Using past experiences such as the ones included helps support and grow the authors idea.  When talking about something as dangerous as exploring another planet, it is easy to see that our Earth bound technology simply cannot do the job. in paragraph 5 of the article, the author describes an idea that was thought up by \"The National Aeronautics and Space Administartion\". This idea is to have humans 30 or so miles above Venus for exploration. The author claims how this would be beneficial in keeping humans safe from the Venusian landscape. However, The author does not support this idea well, as he goes on to say how not much exploration can be done from there, and the conditions would still be extremely dangerous but \"survivable\". Also in paragraph 7, the author explains how NASA is working on other approaches to study Venus. He explains how they are working on some simplified electronics, made of silicon carbide, that have been testedd in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface. This may sound like a good thing, but it is far from one. This is because the author finsihes by saying that the electronics lasted only three weeks. If a computer can't withstand Venus's conditions longer than three weeks, I am very doubtful that a human can. This proves my point that our technology is far too inadvanced for such a task like exploring another planet. Therefore supporting my claim that the author did a poor job in supporting this idea.  The author mentions, \"More importantly, researchers cannot takes samples of rock, gas, or anything else, from a distance.\" Although this may be a challenge, the author states that many researchers are working on innovations that would allow their machines to last long enough to contribute meaningfully to their knowledge of Venus. In paragraph 7, it states that NASA is working on other approaches to studying Venus, and that it is possible and worthy of doing so. One project is looking back to an old technology called mechanical computers. \"By comparison, systems that use mechanical parts can be made more resistant to pressure, heat and other forces.\"  The second issue is safety. According to NASA, they have a solution for getting a spaceship to Venus carefully and safely. \"Imagine a blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the roiling Venusian landscape. Just as our jet airplanes travel at a higher altitude to fly over many storms, a vehicle hovering over Venus would avoid the unfriendly ground conditions by staying up and out of their way. At thirty-plus miles above the surface, temperatures would still be toasty at around 170 degrees Fahrenheit, but the air pressure would be close to that of sea level on Earth. Solar power would be plentiful, and radiation would not exceed Earth levels. Not easy conditions, but survivable for humans.\" (paragraph 5). NASA has a soultion for the safety issue that was recently brought to their attention. The people who want to go and explore Venus now believe that this is one of the final steps toward actually getting off of the ground. If NASA trains astronauts well enough, tries to simulate the conditions on Venus, and everything works well; there is noting holding them back. ",

                "content": "In the excerpt, \"The software is the latest innovation from Prof. Thomas Huang, of the Beckham Institute for Advanvced Science at the University of Illinois, working in collaboration with Prof. Nicu Sebe of the University of Amsterdam,\" shows just how recent this technology is. (D'Alto 1). With this in mind, if students were able to be introduced and subject to this technology, there could be future scientist that want to further improve this technology and, until then, would be more involved in it's place at school. (D'Alto 1). Also, due to the fact that this technology is not only limited to the classroom, it is then evident that other jobs could be produced out of this technology being in the classroom, sparking interest in young and vulnerable students. As the author includes, \"The same technology can make computer-animated faces more expressive--for video games or video surgery,\" it is showsn just exactly how various the fields are that this technology could be used in. (D'Alto 6). Whether a kid is devoted to learning about medicne or engrossed in playing games, it has been shown that this technology in the classrooms would expose these kids to it's capabilities and potentially create a passion. (D'Alto 6). Therefore, by including this technolgy in the classroom with it's own purpose, the students would be subject to technolgy that is blooming in several fields and could easily inspire a child to become something that utilizes this technology in their future.  There is a saying that goes as this; \"You can't make everyone happy.\" One would typically use this saying if an action they make improves the situation for one person, but creates a worse situation for another. However, if Professor Thomas Huang's new 'Facial Action Coding System' proves to be what he says it can be, then Huang believes that there actually is a way to make everyone happy, even in the school setting.  Research conducted by various universities, such as the University of Chicago, has shown that students are not prepared for upcoming projects every time they complete a teacher-designed project;  Thomas Haung's new software would not only find useages in a classroom, but also in daily life.  Dr. Huang also explains that \"the facial expressions for each emotion are universal\" reguardless of the desgree of expression, (D'Alto). Finally, the fear of more computer based activities is rapidly squashed by the contradiction that being more aware should envoke more human interaction, not lesson it.  Initially, the thought of additional advancement of technology is frightening. Predicting ideas is not always a sure way of indicating what will occur. However, after Dr. Huang introduces and explains his new concept of Facial Action Coding System Technology, it is arduous to reject the placement of this software into everyday life. Hopefully, the program will be installed soon so it can start making improvements in various industries across the board.  The human body has way more than just six emotions so getting a high accuracy reading on how you are really feeling is out of the question because FACS uses the a process of a 3-D model Dr. Huang states \"The process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D model of the face; all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles.\" This quote explains that it has to use a way of making a model which can sometimes take some time depending on the processing power of the computer not only that but human emotions can change quite quickly and if the pc doesnt make the model fast enough the computer can easly fail at getting and accuarate reading.  The ability to have a classroom computer that is able to read the emotional expressions of students, would be very valuable is a classroom, because it allows the lesson to be taught in a way that would benefit the students, according to Dr. Huang  Dr. Huang is talking about how it can change the ads you see and veiw if you dont look happy when you look at them. Dr. Huang states \"For example when a web ad appears on your screen and you smile a similar ad may follow, But if you frown the next ad will be different. A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,\" Dr. Huang predicts. This Quote and prediction of Dr. Huang states that is has potential to keep students intrestred into work  In the article, Nick D'Alto used a quote from Dr. Huang which was \"'A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,' Dr. Huang predicts. 'Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor. ",

The best argumants in favor of it are mostly assertions without much basis in reality. And the arguments against direct election ar spurios at best. Its hard to say but Bob Dole was right: Abolish the electoral college!\" This Quote states that the electoral college is not fair and down right rediculus  The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. The system has been around for milleniums from our founding fathers and the Constitution in the 1700s to present day America, it is critical that we update our system to a more realistic process where the citizens have more say in the leader we choose to lead us.  In conculsion, \"It's offical: The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. The best arguments in favor of it are mostly aserations without much basis in reality\", according to Source 2.  I would like you to consider all the problems our nation is facing due to the Electoral College. I have stated two contentions of why you should abolish the Electoral College; First,the method of how its done is very bias and unfair and secondly, because the Electoral College is a \"Disaster Factor\" or  causes many disruptions in our country.  \"It's offcial: The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational\" (Plumer, Source 2). Many do not like the electoral college for these reasons and many others such as it can be a distaster or because it is just plain dumb. Also there are a few reasons why the electoral college should be kept such as avoiding run-off elections or big states, but those not in favor of it out weigh those in favor of it.  \"It's official: The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational,\" says Bradford Plumer, and he couldn't be closer to the truth. The electoral college system does not represent the people of America accurately and is more likely to result in a tie compared to the popular vote. To conclude, source 3 says the electoral college is \"a non-democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be overruled by declaring the candidate who receives the most popular votes the winner  \"The Electoral College is unfair, outdated, and irrational.\"(Plumer, The Indefensible Electoral College) It says it all, when the Founding Fathers made the Electoral college, the country was a lot smaller than it is today. The Electoral College was needed because there was a chance that the election could be tied. Today, the country is huge. The chance of a tie 1 in a trillion chance. I feel that we should give it a try, and abolish the College. This nation stands by freedom, and voting should be a choice.     The Electoral College is \"unfair,outdated,and irrational\". if the Electoral College is unfair why should should the U.S keep this process in our goverment? who really knows? But on the other hand popular votes is a great way to keep voteing fair and rattional to the U.S citizens  In \"Source 2: The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong\", author Bradford Plumer claims \"the electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational\" because \"candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning.\" This means that the candidates focus on the \"tight races of the 'swing' states.\" To continue, Plumer also argues that changing to election by popular vote makes every vote count  In conclusion, why is the Electoral college unhealthy? This system of voting is outdated and has many flaws throughout its system. Without this system being changed is could have a tremendous affect in the future of the United States. This irrational system lacks a basis in reality. The arguments against direct elections are spurious at best. It is difficult to say but the Electoral College in general was a mistake.  ",

So a solid regional favorite, such as Romney was in the South, has no incentive to campaign heavily in those states, for he gains no electoral votes by increasing his pularity in states that he knows he will win.\" A presidential canidate should be able to gain votes from his region because that is the states the canidate are more familiar with so, he will be able to campaign better in those states and if he becomes president he will be equal to all the other regions. You could avoid this with the fair method of popular vote.  As stated in the third article, paragraph 19, \"...because a candidate with only regional appeal is unlikely to be a successful president.\" Also in the paragraph, it states that no region has enough electoral votes to elect a president. If the president was decided by popular vote, however, can you imagine what it would be like? Take Romney, for example. He was a solid regional favorite in the South. Romney knew that there was no incentive to campaign heavily in the South, because he would not gain any electoral votes by increasing his plurilaty in states he knew he would win. If popularity decided the president, residents of the other regions might feel like their vote would not count, and that the president would have no regard for their interests. Say that popularity did actually determine a winner. While most regions might vote for a certain presidents, the ones that did not would feel like that the man running the country wasnt really \"their president\". However, Mr. Senator, if the Electoral College was to stay, this problem would never exist. With the system we have now, the people vote for your state's electors when they vote for the president. Most states also have a \"winner-take-all\" system. Therefore, the canidate with the most votes in a state win's that state's electors. This lets the voting be even, fair. A popular vote would make the voting unfair to those who did not want that president.  It stated in the article that \"A solid regional favorite, such as Romney was in the south,has no incentive to campaign heavily in those states, for he gains no electoral votes by increasing his plurality in states that he knows he will win.\"So this keeps the president from having to go to every state because its just no based of popular vote and want every individual person votes for.  If a candidate has a regional appeal they are not likely to win. No region (South, North, etc.) has enough electoral votes to elect a president. For example Romney was in the South and the South has no incentive to campaign, so he gets no electoral votes.  The canidates hold off on campaigning in states they already know they have dominated the votes in, because there is no one region that can elect a president. This makes voter feel inferior, and discourage them from \"wasting\" their time voting. If we use the majority of votes way to establish the new president, it is more likely that they will decide to vote once again, since they feel as if their opinion once again matters  With this in mind, there should be no Electoral College because the author suggests in Source 3: paragraph 19 that \"The Electoral College requires a presidential canidate to have trans-regional appeal.  The Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal.\" \"This is a desireable result because a candidate with only regional appeal is unlikely to be a successful president.\" This shows that it is beneficial because it makes a candidate who has only regional appeal, have to work harder in other states to show that he would be fair to all states, not just the ones that support him. Furthermore, it allows for massive regional advantages, like the South, mean nothing because they would still have to convince the North to vote for them.  The other factor tying in is that the voters feel as if their direct vote does not count. While it is true one vote cannot sway the election, it becomes apparent that canidates must have transregional appeal, meaning that they're favored in that region of the U.S.  Not one region or state has enough electoral votes to elect a president (Par 19 and 21).\u00a0 This is a good thing because canidates pay equal attention to all of America's people.\u00a0 Also, in the Electoral College, not every state has the same amount of electoral votes because every state has a different population size.\u00a0  This is crutial because \"a candidate with only regional appeal is unlikely to be a successful president\" (Posner).\u00a0 With the Electoral College in place it makes it impossible to for a candidate with only regional appeal to become president because no region has enough electoral votes to elect them ",

                "content": "Every human makes a mistake at some point in his or her life. Whether they are distracted by something they see or they fall asleep at the wheel, people will make errors; it is part of our nature. On the other hand, computers function on data and do not make nearly the amount of mistakes as people.  Your actions are never really forgotten. They can be forgiven, or almost forgotten, but they will always be tucked in your mind or somebody else's mind. Sometimes people aren't very cautious about what they say or do, and they don't think about how others might get affected by their actions. Asking multiple people for advice is greatly rewarding because it gives you a sense of many opinions and feelings on a certain subject. Having good and varying advice can help stop you from doing something you might regret later on. Instead of jumping to conclusions and caving in to your impulse, you should ask as many people as you can for advice. That way, you can have time to think about what to do in a bad situation.  In today's world, things like video games, cell phones, and computers fill up teenagers lives and distract them from things like homework. Schools and classrooms however, either have don't have those distractions or put limits on them to keep students working and not playing games or texting. If some people can't even complete their homework because of these distractions at home, then how will they complete their daily home schooling assignments on top of that? Student work completion would drop and their futures will be impacted dramatically. Many people, especially teenagers, need guidance and restrictions in order to get work done. Even though some students have already created that habit for themselves of getting work done, others have not and giving them an option of distance learning will be devastating for them.  The saying that other people show the best in you can be used when talking about giving advice, because people can show you new ways to see something or tell you something that you didnt know. Friends can show you the situation you are in from all different angles and not just the one you are stuck in. They can also tell you what they would do in your shoes, or how they would handle your position. Past experiences can change a persons perspective of their life so they don't make the same mistake twice, but they can also help others to not make the mistake at all. In conclusion, there are many ways others can help you for advice like sharing their past, saying what they would do, and showing you all perspectives. Everything talked about in this essay can help you come to your conclusion on what is best for you.  Going out of your comfort zone can really help you feel better about yourself, and not just keeping to yourself. Some Evidence for this is that, in a study taken by the Social Interaction and Communication Association, 60% of students that keep to themselves have lower than average self esteem. This would make sense seeing how if they always keep to themselves, they don't really have anyone to comfort them in their darker times, which this rule could help prevent. More Evidence that highlights this point is when Zachary Andrews, A College student from Colombia, had this to say, \"I honestly never really talked to that many people when I was younger, I didn't really like myself, and didn't think I deserved friends, but when my parents made me join the basketball team, I met and found people that I got along with really well,\". This would show that their is still hope for people that have low self esteem, that just have to have help taking the big step.   Suppose the distractions are not an issue. A student sits down at his computer, switches it on, and is greeted by a neon light and artificial sounds. After the lecture, the student reaches out, switches the screen off, and takes a nap. This seems completely fine, but the student is missing a very crucial step; actual human interaction. This is vital for any functioning adult. No matter what job one has, they will always have to interact with another human.  Nick D' Alto says \"Imagine a computer that knows when you're happy or sad.\" The author of this article talks of how it will improve ad placements by whether you smile or frown, however I know for a fact social medias, especially Facebook, are already basing information on preferable ads by just what material you look at. Why is it necessary for a program to constantly scan our face just to see if we like something or not? This gives the computer so much power of constantly knowing what your exact emotions are on everything. It is just so unnecessary that it causes one to question why in the world would we risk giving computers that kind of power. Also, is it appropiate to constantly scan childrens' faces as they are trying to learn? Would there be a security system in place or parental agreement necessary that would allow the permission of constant invasion of privacy in the name of education? There are many ethical questions and unknown future outlooks that one would not want to subject children to that sort of test of safety and security.  some students that often take online courses may get bored because they're constantly staring at a screen, so taking online classes starts to get boring for them and they start to get lazy and refrain from doing their work, students do that because they're constantly staring at a screen which starts to give eye problems. sitting behind a screen for prolonged hours causes problems for the eyes such as watery eyes and pain in the eye, sometimes eye twitches which make learning frustrating. So as a result, students stop doing their work. Whereas in a school building, students are not always looking at screens but white boards also which is less harmful to the eyes. Students are not lazy because classes ring from bell to bell, so students are always up and moving rather that sitting behind a computer all day. It's best to go to school without being lazy and staying healthy rather than using a video conference to learn.  While the internet can be used in very useful and academic ways, there are also a plethora of ways to get sidetracked. Things like social media platforms and Netflix will always be there taunting the student, requiring a substantial amount of willpower to not give into these deep dark holes of mindless entertainment. If it is already hard enough for students to focus in classrooms with a physical adult present giving instructions, just think how much harder it will be to focus without any of these accomodations (plus the addition of having the freedom to wear pajamas and move at their own pace). Not only will they have other platforms distracting them, but they will also have to make sure they are staying on track and not pushing things off to the last minute  The best way to understand how the world works is to ask questions. Without questions we would still be living in caves with no electricity and wearing no clothes. \"Two heads are always better than one\", said the great Albert Einstein. Asking multiple opinions will produce a better outcome than just using you're knowledge on the subject. There is only one way to put this, it is a complete mistake for someone to go into something blind, you need to know your surroundings, it just so happens that the only way to avoid going into something blind, is asking people their opinions.\u00a0   \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0   \u00a0 ",

To conclude, the state senator should favor in keeping the Electoral College rather than changing to election be popular vote for the president of the United States because less disputes will occur and not participating will not be effective.       \u00a0    To conclude I belive that my state senator should remove the electoral colleges. To change the election by popular vote for the president of the United States. For the fact that voters vote not for the president but for a slate of electors. Who can always defy the will of the people. It should also be removed because its simply unfair to the voters. There votes may or may not be counted or may vote for the wrong person or oppsite party. The Electoral College is unfair, outdated, and irrational.     There has been some conterversy between whether we should keep the Electoral College or changing the election to popular vote for the president. There are pros and cons to each method of voting. The Electoral College has been around since the beginning of our country. Most of the time it is successful (there have been a few times problems have occured but rarely it happens). As time has passed and we enter a more modern age, people have started to feel that the Electoral College does not work and we should all switch to just a regular popular vote.  The electoral college seems to have worked for all these years , but my opinion on this is that we should change it to electing a president with popular vote. There are many pros and cons to both the electoral college and the popular vote but the positives of the popular vote outweigh the negatives more then the electoral does.  You cannot deny, changing to election by popular vote for the president of the United States would be extremely beneficial for our country. Citizens would regain their Constitutional-right to vote for the leaders who make major decisions for the entire country. The Electoral College is useful to produce a clear winner in elections, but is evidently not completely necessary and is unfair to voters who want and deserve a say in the outcome(Plumer 13, 14). Abolishing this system would cause for a drastically more fair election and greater citizen satisfaction for multitudinous reasons. Please consider.  To conclude this letter, I again say that the Electoral College should be changed to election by popular vote because, popular vote is fairer then the Electoral College, the people have no power compared to the electors and the are subject to corruption with in the system.  Because of the winer takes all system in each state it's unfair to the voters and it's unfair to me so changing the election by popular votes for the president of the united states would be best.  In conclusion, I strongly feel that we need to change to an election by popular vote.\u00a0 Above all, it is more fair to the people.\u00a0 Citizens would feel that their votes matter more than they do now.\u00a0 People wouldn't have to be worried about if the electors would flip on what they had voted for.\u00a0 Although some say its is absolutely fair throughout all the states, there are still the set backs that come along with keeping an Electoral College.\u00a0 I agree with former presidents, Nixon and Carter, that we need to abolish the Electoral College.\u00a0 All of these reasons show you the problems there are with the current system of electing our President and I know you will agree  im writting this letter to you so you consider changing to election by popular vote for the prsident of the united states instead of electoral college. i belive like branford plumer, that the electoral college is very wrong not only because under the electoral college system, voters dont vote for the president but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president. but also because it is very unfair to voters, candidates dont spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the \"swing\" states.

At some point, many will realize that computers are smarter than humans in many ways. Even though many think that the computers will have internal failure and create issues, I do not think that is the case. Companies involved in this new technology will test the product far before the release of any of their final product. The last thing they want is to have a disaster of driverless car failure. The fact that people support these ideas rather than oppose them shows that the majority of the population will want these vehicles on the street. The advancements that are currently being made and the support of the public make a point. Completely driverless cars will be here soon, and it is only a matter of time before everyone is introduced.  A project called mechanical computers was first evisioned in the 1800s. The author further supports how its worthy by stating, \"...these devices make calculations by using gears and levers and do not require electronics at all\" (Paragraph 7). He describes it as safer, since gear usually ensures that someone will not be exposed to a certain conditon in a inhabitable environment for humans. He further argues that modern computers are more fragile in extreme conditions, and are not as strong as mechanical computers. He strongly supports it by comparing it to other popular technologies, \"...imagine exposing a cell phone or tablet to acid or heat capable of melting tin\" (Paragraph 7). He explains in comparison, that systems using mechanical parts are far more resistant to pressure, heat, and other forces, unlike modern technology. He uses well thought out support and evidence, to argue that Venus is actually a worthy pursuit even with the dangers it gives. He believe that studing Venus will lead to challenges that will further evolve humanity and help it prosper.   If there is an error or flaw in your idea, they can point it out so your idea won't contain that flaw anymore. An example is the Apple Company that makes a variety of electronics that people. They don't have just one version of the idea that they made; they have many different types of phones, each coming from different years with different ideas of the ideal iPhone that everyone would like to buy. People give their ideas to the Apple Company, such as having a phone with no home button, having a bigger-sized phone, or even having a brand new product, like AirPods. Many people who ask one person think it can be embarrassing to ask someone if there is anything wrong just to find out there is something wrong, although it doesn't matter if you get embarrassed or not. It matters that you got the mistake from someone and corrected that mistake for the better of the people. In fact, having more problems is better than having none, because that just means you just have some more to work on, and if the first type of your idea doesn't work out, you can always try again and again with your idea until it has reached the best outcome it can possibly receive.  At the seventh passage, the author states that, \"Your home PC can't handle the complex algorithms used to decode Mona Lisa's smile,\" suggesting that the majority of modern computers do not have the power to actually run the software. The PCs that schools buy are almost never more powerful than the ones bought by consumers for household use, and would thus also not be able to process the data, making the technology rather useless in an educational setting.  Because it is not the computers duty to exlain everything to you, not everyone has accsess to this kind of software, and people may lose their sensitivity to the fine art of emotion reading, I am in opposition of implementing this FACS technology.  Back in the 1950's people had to use cars to do eveything. From talking to a friend face to face to going to the nearest resturant. But now you can do all of that in your own living room, due to technology that has advanced us to be able to use Facetime, Skype, or Oovoo to talk to our friends face to face using out phone, tablet, or personal computer. And to drive anywhere we need to we have apps the diliver taxies to our houses for us.\"...the Internet makes telecommuting possible and allows people to feel more connected without driving to meet friends...Likewise the rise in cellphones and car-pooling apps have facilitated more flexiable commuting arrangements, including the evolution of shared can services fro getting to work.\" ( Paragraph 35, Rosenthal)  Working everyday will effect this because no one wants to miss work. Missing work means less money and creates more stress for the person missing work. By saving maybe $10 on gas that day you're missing out on the $125 you could've made by working, but there's another solution to this also. Car-pool! Even if you're driving the car yourself or you're in the car you're saving fule and money.  If a student becomes bored or distracted while using computer programs, it can turn the student off from the lesson. This technology \"can make computer-animated faces more expressive\" in any interactive activities the student might encounter to hold its attention (D'Alto). Also, layouts, fonts, prints, etc. could be altered to make the lesson more interesting to the user, therefore catching the student's attention with something it deems fun.  While computers were made to help us, it cannot be our only source of information. On the other hand, teachers are st school for the sole purpose of helping you learn. It is their actual job to be there to help you learn things. While computers are a tool to help achieve this goal, there are other ways to learn about things and get them explained to you.  When you are in highschool, many teachers and parents will say things to you along the lines of \"In the real world\" and \" Highschool is preparing you for the real world\". Later on in life, \"in the real world\", if you get bored at a job you cannot just change what you are doing. You have to continue on with it because it is your job. If we implemented this system now in schools, many kids and teens would get in their mindset that if they are bored or don't understand something, things will change for them. Kids should not rely on a computer to help them understand everything. There are teachers, classmates, parents, and other adults who can help.  The age of computers is inescapable, but it doesn't have to be. Instead of computer analyzed emotional connection, people should put their phones down and ask each other how they are. Not every person wants their emotions analyzed, especially in schools. Students bonds with teachers are simply student to teacher; a child must trust an adult before they talk about their feelings. Computer facial technology might be helpful, but not in schools. This technology falls flat in the category of connection. Don't take the easy way out, instead of analyzing emotions with a computer, ask someone how they are. If a student looks upset, sit down and talk with them. Show someone they are valuable and deserve one on one human interaction  Anything in the world could be hacked. Anyones phone can be hacked, computers can be hacked and even intelligence units can be hacked. So, if these things can be hacked then what makes one think that this driverless car can't be hacked. And, if hacked there would be no telling what the hacker could do to the car. For example, cause it to crash or lead the car into an area the driver in unfamiliar with because they're not paying attention. These examples could all cause harm to more than just the driver and that shows why this car should not be implemented into society, because it has various accounts on how it can misfunction. ",

                "content": "This is beneficial because, of course, past experience with the problem can lead to better advice than advice from someone that has never faced the problem. For example, person one, once again, is having trouble with the cursed car, so person one goes to person two, person three, person four, person five, person six, and person seven. Person two, person three, and person five all give some advice that they found on the internet, person four offers to help but really doesn't know what he/she is doing. Person six just shrugs and says, \"I don't know what to do.\" But person seven was a car mechanic for a few years, and person one didn't know that. So person seven not only gives advice that helps fix the car's current problem, he/she also fixes it to the point where it doesn't break down twice every week. The point is, if you go to multiple people for advice, chances are, you'll find someone with hands-on experience that can help you with the problem.  If you are talking to family member they may not care about your problems or say something along the lines of \"oh honey it's ok you will be fine\" and them saying that is not fine and you should never be satisfied with that answer from anyone. Your friend or close peer, like a teacher or coach will want to understand your issue and they want to help you at all costs because they know that your a good kid and they never want to see you down,moody or upset ever. Your coaches put you through struggle and so do you teachers so they know you can handle the hard moments in life and want to always help you, so you can make the right decision. whenever you hear a question in class you want to seek understanding about the question so you can answer it the next time someone asks. The issue hear is very similar to that and when you have a problem or issue that you believe needs a second opinion they will always be willing to listen. That way they can ultimately impact your decision for the better and you will be so relieved and you will ask yourself why you didn't go to them earlier  Not all people like talking about their problems to many people. These people may decide on a solution, then simply to a sort of poll, to validate it. They may ask someone, should I do this, and weigh the amount of \"yes\" to the amount of \"no\" and decide whether or not it is good based off of that. Though this method works, you may be blind sided and not be able to see both parts of your solution. Rather than doing a yes or no poll, asking people for advice and instead, writing them down and grouping them together by what they mean is a better way to conduct a poll. If someone tells you yes or no, they aren't able to tell you exactly what they do or do not like about your idea.  I personally have always believed in the idea of going to a second opinion about an issue and I always want to help people with their problems just like they help me with mine. You should never discredit your parent or guardians opinion because they could ultimately be correct when it's all said and done. However the minute you start only listening to your parents is the minute when your friends lose trust in you, and you lose trust in them. Remember that whenever a conflict is resolved or your problem is fixed you always have to credit someone for helping you with your problem and if that person is someone other than your parents than you have learned that your peers may be less experienced but they could be just as wise and just as intelligent as your parent or guardian. Finally when you make your ultimate decision based on the advice you were given you are very well informed and you can learn the different perspectives and different lessons that can be taught by different people and you come out of the experience so much wiser and smarter than you ever were before.  sometimes a problem can only be solved when you take a step back and try to look at in a new way, and talking to multiple people concerning the topic\u00a0can help someone do this. For example, say someone got into an argument with a friend after being offended by something the friend said, after they talked to multiple people about this they then could see that the friend didnt mean to offend him/her. If the person had not gone to someone\u00a0else for\u00a0advice then they wouldn't\u00a0have realized that the friend was sorry and didnt mean to offended him/her, by talking to multiple people it helped them make a better choice. Besides helping people look at their problem from a different perspective, talking to multiple people can still help people make better choices in other ways, they could get information from someone that the previous people that they talked to didnt know, and the information could help influence their decision.  Sadly students with learning\u00a0disabilities are forgotten about and neglected. Unlike children with autism or special needs students with attention disorders take the same classes as the general population. Therefore students 504 plans are followed based on who the teacher is, and sadly some teachers dont care. This means the student will not receive any accommodations such as more time on test. This can lead to poor grades, and not because the student isnt prepared. A student with ADD will have to read a problem 5 times before they really retain the information and even then everything is done slower because when students with attention disorders try to force their brain work too fast that is when things are forgotten and missed.   Getting advice from multiple people can be unnecessary or vital depending on how severe the issue is, and not a lot of people see the part where it's important to get advice from several different people. Many people just think that they should get advice from one person, or even just get advice from himself/herself. But both of those solutions to needing advice can be incorrect if the problem is big enough.  If a person is having troubles in all of his classes a teacher cant only pay attention to him she has to look after the rest of the class. if they are at the back the teacher might not get to him because of all the people at the front. This way the student learns the minimum amount of knowledge he needs to pass the test or the quiz.   At one point in life everyone has gone through or knows someone who has been through a tough decision. A couple years ago I had a friend who always gave advice to everyone's\u00a0problems. She was beautiful, intelligent and fun to be around. However, she did not feel this way about herself. As time went on some situations became too heavy to handle, the stress grew on top of her. At school she only showed perkiness, meanwhile, she was in a darker place. No one was aware of this until a few weeks later when she spoke to her friends, then counselors, next teachers and eventually her parents to get the help she wanted. She was afraid of what the world would think of her if she wasn't perfect. These people all helped her find ways for comfort and how to get the treatment needed without doing something harmful to herself or others. She was steered back into a safe and happy pathway thanks to the help of those around her.  If you live by the motto \"Put others before yourself\" it is critical to understand that the decision you make could negatively affect others, as well as yourself. An example of this is smoking marijuana. By doing this, you could be causing others to be doing it as well, just because you are doing it. You could be at a legal age, but marijuana is still bad for you as well as others. Asking your friends if they are okay with it and if it is a good decision, can cause you to realize that in the long run, it is a bad and not a thought-out decision. Like said before, other people's lives are also important and seeking help before a decision, to make sure that it is good and well-thought out, can make a true impact in others. ",

This system or process is a total disaster. Paragraph thirteen states, \"At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winner-take-all system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the 'swing' states.  These People were Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and the AFL-CIO. Turned out their not the only ones according to the exerpt from \"The Indefensible Electoral College: why even the best-laid defenses are wrong.\" is sates \"They're not alone; according to a Gallup poll in 2000 taken shortly after Al Gore- thanks the quirks of the electoral college- won the popular vote but lost the presidency, over 60 percent of the voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now.\"  according to the article a gallup pole in 2000, taken shortly after Algore thanks to the quirks of the electoral college won the popular vote but won the presidency, over 60 percent of the voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now. Electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winner take all system in each state, canidates dont spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the \"swing\" states.  According to my knowledge, the Electoral College isn't fair to voters. I know that many people such as, Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and the AFC-CIO agree with me on this. For instance, in the second passage on the first paragraph, it says that and much more. \"They're not alone [Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter...]; according to a Gallup poll in 2000, taken shortly after Al Gore - thanks to the quirks of the Electoral College - won the popular vote but lost the presidency, over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now.\" Suggesting by what this satement says, a lot of people disagree with our system of election  This was also agreed upon by many other citizens. According to a Gallup Poll in 2000, which was taken shortly after Al Gore won the popular vote, but lost the popular vote. According to the poll \"over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election not\u00a0 the kind we have now.\" It is said that \"this year voters are to expect another close election in which the popular vote winner could again loose the presidency.\"  Stated in source 2, \" Gallup poll in 2000, taken shortly after Al Gore-thanksto the quirks of the electoral college- won the popular vote but lost the presidency, over 60 percent off voters would prefer a dirt election to the kind we have now.\" In short, people were so unhappy with the election and the way it ended. people would rather have direct voting than to continure with an Electoral college.  According to the Gallup pole in the 2,000, taken shortly after Al Gore, thanks to the quirks of the electoral college, won the popluar vote but lost the presidency. Over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now. This is what im talking about people. People are losing their elections due to the electoral college. One of the major reasons of why people are wanting a change, there should be no electoral college, only a popular vote for the election. We all want a better Government. I only there was a better way to vote.  Here is a prime example, in the 2000 election Al Gore won the popular vote but because he had less electoral votes than Bush he unfourtunetly lost the election. According to Bradford Plumer \"over 60% of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now.\" It seems rather logical that if somebody gains the most votes in an election that the country would prefer that canidate to be the president. For that reason alone the reader should side with the idea to abolish the electoral college. Now besides somebody receiving more or less electoral votes, perhaps the candidates tied. In this case it gets thrown to the House Of Representitives which will cause a Wyoming Rep. with 500,000 voters to have just as much say as a California Rep. with 35,000,000 voters. All a tie would do is corrupt the voting system even more than it is. For those reasons there should be an indefinite ban on the electoral college.  They took away the right as an American they gave you in the first place. Popular vote should replace the Electoral College. There have been instances where the popular vote reined supreme, but the Electoral College didn't agree. In the article, \"The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong\" it mentions an election where Al Gore lost even though he won the popular vote. \"...according to a Gallup poll in 2000, taken shortly after Al Gore-thanks to the quirks of the electoral college-won the popular vote but lost the presidency...\" This helps show the people that it seems our vote isn't what is truly important, it's only what the Electoral College does that makes a true impact on choosing of president for the next two years. It's even stated in the very same article that, \"...over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now.\" If our vote truly matters then why not vote on keeping the Electoral College in play or getting rid of the flawed system once and for all.  According to a poll taken in 2000, 60% of voters would rather direct voting over the current system. With the current \"  winner-take-all  \" concept in most all states except Maine and Nebraska, many people find that even if 45% of all the votes in the state are for one party, all of the votes go to the opposition. Citizens may as well not even vote under this standard if they wont even be represented. ",

GM has developed driver\u0092s seats that vibrate when the vehicle is in danger of backing into an object. The Google car simply announces when the driver should be prepared to take over. Other options under consideration are flashing lights on the windshield and other heads-up displays. Automakers and manufacturers are assuring your safety while deveopling the future.  That is why manufacturers are considering using displays that will automatically turn themselves off so that the driver does not get distracted behind the wheel and cause a serious accident. GM has developed driver's seats that vibrate when the vehicle is in danger of backing into an object, which would then notify the driver that they are too close to an object and that they should stop immediately and look at their surroundings. All of the little gadgets that are put into this car as well as other cars, are allowing the driver to pay better attention to the road and the objects around him. Cars are getting smarter by the year which is reducing the number of accidents per day. Which is why driverless cars are a must for safety.  For example, BMW developed the \"Traffic Jam Assistant.\" This car could handle driving functions at speeds up to 25 mph. This car also had special touch sensors to ensure the driver holds onto the wheel. Having cars that aren't fully driverless allows the driver to remain alert, so they can take over when there is a situation. This is a great thing about these cars. There are driver seats that vibrate when the car is in danger of backing into something. The Google car announces when the driver should take over. Other cars might have flashing lights or other signals that warn the driver to take control of the vehicle.  The cars can handle driving functions at speeds up to 25 mile per hour, but special touch sensors make sure the driver keeps hold of the wheel. Even though the word \"driverless\" may scare you, none of the cars developed so far are completely driverless. Which means you are still somewhat in control of the car. The cars may be able to steer, accelerate and brake themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills, such as navigating through work zones and around accidents. The driver must stay alert and be ready to take over when the time comes. The car can quickly get the driver's attention whenever a problem occurs. GM has developed driver's seats that vibrate when the vehicle is in danger of backing into an object. Other options under consideration are flashing lights on the windshield and other heads-up displays. Basically, while the driver watches the road, the car watches the driver. (Paragraph 7)  Cameras, drivers seats that vibrate when a vehicle is in danger, and flashing lights on windshields see all components that are possible to add to the already sustainable Smart Cars to make them more interesting, effective, and productive.  The reliance of a driver within the driverless car finalizes the development of the driverless car. If the car encounters a foreign situation, the driver will just be notified and will take over from there. This concept of passing over the responsibility of driving makes the driverless car very safe. As long as there is an alert driver within the car, the car is almost certainly not going to make any accidents. Car developers designed the driverless car to \"steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but all to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills.\" Thus, the car will do most of the driving and when there is a difficult situation, the human driver will take over. This ensure the utmost safety of the driver and the passengers as there is an extremely low risk of an accident occuring. There are \"driver's seats that vibrate\" and the Google car even \"announces when the driver should be prepared to take over.\" This increases the safety of the driverless car as the driver will be notified when to take over. Therefore, the driver will also know the situation and will be ready to handle any troubles the driverless car couldn't handle. The safety features positively affect the development of the driverless car.  Sebastian Thrun, founder of the Google Car project, believes that with the technolgy progressing consumers can have a driverless cab take us wherever we would like to go. Along with the sensors the radar will help with the antilock system to make that dream come ture.  BMW has already annouced the development of \"Traffic Jam Assistant\". It's a car the can handle driving up to 25 mph, but touch sensors keeps the driver holding the wheel in case of a malfunction. The human driver must remian alert and be able to take over in certain situations. Manufacturers are also considering using cameras to watch that drivers are remaining focused on the road.  The issue of the safety of automoblies is still relevant to driverless cars as well. If there is a situation that the driverless car cannot handle, there could be accidents and damage. However, driverless car developers continue to address this problem, and solutions have been proposed. BMW has announced that they have developed a car that can drive itself for speed up to 25 mph. They also require that the driver keep attention to the wheel, and will notify if there is a situation where the driver must take over. This allows the driver to navigate work zones or around accidents, increasing the safety of the driverless car. The car can alert the driver in several ways, so the driver can always know when it is necessary to drive.  In tedious situations like a traffic jam, driving is boring and energy wasting.  However, driverless cars can take away the exhausting driving experience and allow the driver to relax.  For example, \"Traffic Jam Assistant\" will be very helpful to anyone in a traffic jam because it would take away the boredom of driving in a traffic jam.  Traffic Jam Assistant enables the car to handle driving functions up to 25 miles per hour.  This would be very helpful in a long and tedious traffic jam because one does not drive over 25 miles per hour in a traffic jam.  Also, if taxis could be driverless cars, the quality of life for the average citizen would increase.  Taxis would cost less money, they would be open more often, and they could take passengers to farther destinations.  This would dramatically increase the quality of life for all people and it would make owning a car almost antiquated.  this would provide much finacianal saving for the average person and it would provide a great deal of convinience for the average person as well.   Teen drivers today are distracted when they first begin to drive. With a driverless car, however, teens could possibly get distracted but would not cause an accident. The car could continue driving for them. If the cars could accelerate for the driver, they could also prevent the driver from speeding. This would prevent many young adults who are less experienced on the roads from being pulled over by a police officer and given a ticket. Many parents may also become distracted while driving with young children. Young children need attention from their parents, and while in a car children tend to distract their parents more often usual. When a parent looks away from the road and to the backseat where their child is sitting, even if they are only looking away for a few seconds, they could run into the oncoming lane of traffic or possibly a ditch. With driverless cars, these accidents could be prevented. As long as the parent or teenager has his or her hands on the steering wheel, the car will drive itself. With BMW's \"Traffic Jam Assistant\", the driver would be able to look away from the road and the car would still be able to steer, accelerate, and brake themselves. Incase of a work zone or accident, the driver would be notified and they would assert their attention back to the road. This \"Traffic Jam Assistant\" would be useful while a mother needed to tend to her child in the back seat or while a teenager talked on the phone to their friend. ",

                "content": "First, voters can walk into the booth and \"...get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate\" (Plumer 10). Not every voter is educated on exactly how the electors and candidates are represented on the ballot and that may lead to an accidental win. On top of this misconception, almost decietfully, an elector promised to a candidate can change their vote at a moments notice(Plumer 10). Even Posner who writes for the electoral college admitted that it is possible, and he claims that it is \"rare\";however, it has happened before in 1960 (Plumer 11), and not even Posner can control the actions of an elector, legally anyway. Also, when a candidate wins a popular vote, which is the true mind of the people, that candidate still may not win the electoral vote, overall, loosing the election. This happened just a few years back in the 2000 election between President Bush and Gore(Posner 16).All in all, the electoral college does not represnt the people.  what is this electoral college? You are telling me that i vote for electors thta supposedly are pulling fior my choice of candidate for pesident. I don't think that is right to just take my choice of president and put it in someone else's hands. It should be my choice to whom I want it to be. Now I realize that there is probably some rule that prevents them to changing their mind, but actually I don't think that there is such a rule.  Electoral College believers think that having electors go on either side to let one canidate win, is right. \"Knowing their vote will have no effect, they have less incentive to pay attention to the campaign than they would have if the president were picked by popular vote..\"(Posner). So these Electoral College followers agree with the electors actually selecting the winner because they don't have to do anything. People can just sit back and watch the electors take the power, while the others do nothing but be slumps. In source one, the Office of the Federal Register mention that \"when you vote for your candidate you are actually voting for your candidate's electors.\", which means that if voters have friends in the position of an elector, voters might just vote for the elector because theres nothing else to really pay attention to.  Men who are running for a spot as a presidental candidate are not voted for by the citizens of that state. They have to gain supporters who then become the electors. Then the people of that state have to vote for the electors, not the person to become a presidental candidate. Voters can't even directly vote for who they want. What if you vote for a slate of electors, who are supposed to be in favor of the presidnetal candidate you want, but don't vote for him? What happens then? Presidental candidates who should actually get a chance at running for president because they didn't get enough electoral votes.  This might be the hundreth letter opened about this electoral college topic, but this is a very important subject that needs to be run by all of our citizens. Honestly the electoral college is very important because of the fact that after elections after everyone has voted they are the ones that are the electors for the President and the Vice President. Its not like it was made for no reason it was made to make the elections fair, it's not like it's the first time people have wanted to get abolish the Electoral College even many people have wanted to remove this like for example Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, and more but this dosnt mean that it is the right choice. Yes it is agreed that there are some downs to have the Electoral College, plus even the person that the Electoral College votes fo that might not be the person most of the nation choose. Like now in the 2012 elections Obama had more Electoral votes than Romney\"Because almost all states award the electorsl votes on a winner-takes all basis.\"  Eeveryone should have a say in what goes on where ever it is that they live. We the people make up the government. Who draws the line that states whether or not you are allowed to vote. We do! Therefore we should be able to decied ourselves who can be our president to the United States of America. It is niot fair that we need to elect others to have our submission be made. Even when we tell our electors who we choose, they might turn arouhd and vote for the other person. In  Source 2 \"The indefensible electorial college : why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong by Bradford Plumer\"  backs up my response when stating,\"In the same vein, 'faithless' electors have ocasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please...\". That to me my friend, is not fair at all.  Whats up with the electoral college? Can we really trust it? Ofcourse you cant and all that apose can stand up and walk out the door .The presidental race is a fake!!! So the goverment wants to tell you that you need to be a citezen to vote but what are you voting for?  Chossing your president is something very important and we need a way , a method to help us pick the right one. The Electoral College is the best way of picking the right president and doing it right. If you pick your president by a popular vote it would only lead to a disaster. In our world we need a method like this one that will guide us to make the right desion and something as imporatant as our President, well we can just pick out of anything we have to do it\u00a0 wise and neat so the right choice is picked  The U.S government lets people choose these electors so they feel important in the choices our country makes. We take time to study our favorite candidates, and if the electoral college does not agree with them, they are pushed to the side. What happens to the people who did not vote for the, \"right\" candidate? They are forever unheard. Sentenced to live in a community where they are silcenced. I do not agree with the electoral college because agree with our fore father Abraham Lincoln. He said this was supposed to be a country of the people, by the people, and for the people.   First of all we don't know who picks the electors. We don't know if there truthful as in putting in votes. I'm sure they have to have certain requirments to become an elector but we are not the ones chosing them. In the 2000 campaign 17 states didn't even see the people running in the election. Also in an Electoral College ties exist so then it has to be thrown into the House of Represenatives where the delagations will vote on the president. Making our votes worthless because the people in the goverment get to chose whos next to become president.  ",

                "content": "Having many peoples' opinions presents you with different people giving their own taste at what they like and don't like with the idea you have.  if someone gives you advice that you do not agree with and you get upset just remember that everyone does not think exactly like you. People have their own personal opinions and they will sometimes tell\u00a0you something that you do not like or want to hear . Now if someone gave you advice that you do not like do not ignore it take it as constructive criticism and listen to what they say and have a open mind about it. For example: Lets say you made some food and you add a little to much salt and your friend tells you that it is was to salty and that maybe you should have added less salt but you find the food to taste just right. Next time maybe dont add as much salt. This way you listen to your friends advice even though you disagree and if you find it alright\u00a0and if they find the food better then you both dont lose nothing. And theres other ways to deal with this situation like not cooking that meal, but you decided to listen to your friends advice and in the end it all worked out. Its ok if people have different opinions then you and their advice isnt what you would like to hear but its good that you learn from them.  It's a rebellious stage of life when they think they can do whatever pleases them. So naturally if someone tells them that they absolutely must do something, they automatically think no way. If they have an attitude like this it will ruin the experience and they won't get the good feeling people do when you serve others. They might dislike it so much that they don't even do service when they're grown up. They resent people that tell them they have to do something, and then they are ornery towards everyone else afterwards.  Imagine if a person is trying to open a farm, but the person's best friend hates all farmers. The best friend has a biased opinion towards farmers and hates all of them. When the person asks the best friend if they should start a farm, naturally the best friend will say no. But if the person asks someone who loves animals and the outdoors, that person would say they should open a farm. If the person had only asked the biased best friend who hates farms, they would now not have a job and place to live that they are happy with. This is one example of why people should ask multiple people before making an important choice because people have biased opinions. What if a girl wants to try out for a football team. All of her friends say that is gross and annoying because girls can not play football. This is a biased opinion about girls who play football. While all of the girl's teachers and family say that is a great idea and the change the school needs. If she would not have asked her teachers, she wouldn't be on the team. That is why you should ask multiple people before making an important choice like starting a farm or joining the football team.  The students who don't like it say \"it takes too much time away from what they need or want to do\"  Unfortunately some people don't want to help and only want to focus on themselves. So they give a person poor advice in hopes that the person will stop asking. Then there are some people who are ignorant to the topic.  They don't know enough about the topic to give someone proper advice. Usually these types of people don't have malevolent\u00a0intentions, they just don't know the right things to say. Asking many people helps to separate the good advice from the bad advice people give. It also can help to find the people in someone's life that care about their well being. Which, in the future, will help them make better decisions on later things, because they will know who gives the best advice.  even if I don't like to hear that they don't like it I would rather someone be honest with me then just lie and say they like it.  The reason some people might not think it's a good idea for students to have to participate in one school activity is some students might be stressed if their forced to do an activity they don't want to do, the reason being is, some people have social anxiety this means when put around people they tend to get uncomfortable, nervous, and maybe even cry because they have no clue what to say.  Throughout the school day, everyone has that one class they absolutely hate. They walk into the room and it's like a minute turns from 60 to 1,000 seconds and they are stuck there forever. In this time, nothing gets done and the same amount gets learned. This class consists of about half who actually care about what the subject is, and the other half who can't seem to control themselves enough to not act out in spite of not caring. The half of the students who actually pay attention are stuck with a teacher who has to repeat themselves\u00a0a thousand times a class period when they should be on another chapter by now. This not only frustrates the teacher and the students, but it creates negative air between the students and the teacher. I mean, who wouldn't hate a teacher that talks about the mitochondria a BILLION times a day? In this situation, some perks of distance learning are shown. The students who show passion to learn can be offered one-on-one time with the instructor through video conferencing, which will not only help the faster paced learners, but take away some of the tension in the classroom.  If many people say to not do something then the person knows that majority of people agree it will only do them harm. It is the same for the things a person should do. If many people have the same advice then they know that it's the right thing to do. Indecisiveness is prevalent in many people. Having several voices present\u00a0should enforce the person to make a decision. Someone can also put together all of the advice they get and find the common denominator of the advice. Making the person self assured about following the advice people gave, because so many of their peers thought the same way. You can tweak all of the advice to create a better idea or a stronger piece of advice. Usually your own advice is best for yourself, so adding other people's advice to your own can help you make a greater choice. ",

The best arguments in favor of it are mostly aserations without much basis in reality\", according to Source 2.  I would like you to consider all the problems our nation is facing due to the Electoral College. I have stated two contentions of why you should abolish the Electoral College; First,the method of how its done is very bias and unfair and secondly, because the Electoral College is a \"Disaster Factor\" or  causes many disruptions in our country.  \"It's offcial: The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational\" (Plumer, Source 2). Many do not like the electoral college for these reasons and many others such as it can be a distaster or because it is just plain dumb. Also there are a few reasons why the electoral college should be kept such as avoiding run-off elections or big states, but those not in favor of it out weigh those in favor of it.  \"At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters. because of the winner-takes-all system in each state canidates dont spend time in states they spend no time in stats the know thy wont win.\" Some states can get no canidates out and its because the electoral college is unfair. \"It`s official: The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. The best argumants in favor of it are mostly assertions without much basis in reality. And the arguments against direct election ar spurios at best. Its hard to say but Bob Dole was right: Abolish the electoral college!\" This Quote states that the electoral college is not fair and down right rediculus  \"It's official: The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational,\" says Bradford Plumer, and he couldn't be closer to the truth. The electoral college system does not represent the people of America accurately and is more likely to result in a tie compared to the popular vote. To conclude, source 3 says the electoral college is \"a non-democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be overruled by declaring the candidate who receives the most popular votes the winner  In \"Source 2: The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong\", author Bradford Plumer claims \"the electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational\" because \"candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning.\" This means that the candidates focus on the \"tight races of the 'swing' states.\" To continue, Plumer also argues that changing to election by popular vote makes every vote count  So if you live in a state like Texas for example, your votes goes to 34 Democratic electors that you don't know and this can create confusion about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate. The best argument about the electoral college is the disaster factor. It happen once in 1960 where \"Louisianna legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who oppose John F. kennedy,\" Which means that those popular votes for Keenedy would not actually gone to him. Bob Dole says the electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational.  In the article I read, it stated \"At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters. unfair, outdated, irrational\" I agree completely  The electoral college is not only obsolete, unnesessary and parasitic, but also unfair to many voters. The main ways this unfairness can be identified are extreme, and each really deserve a paragraph of their own. Let us imagine a scenario: a democrat lives in a mostly republican state  Maybe it will be that way in the future, because due to the Electoral College, votes there don't even matter anymore. Citizens are losing faith in their expressions of freedom and ability to vote and uphold justice. The Electoral College needs to go, because it makes for an unfair political system that only benefits politicians running, not the average joe.\"It's official: The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational.

On the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet.\" In addition, the article also states, \"Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system, even though Mercury is closer to our sun.\" The conditions on that planet Venus are much worse than on Eath, the planet contains such heat that it is over 800 degrees Fahrenheit.   The author goes on to list the physical dangers of Venus: \"On the planet\u0092s surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet\" (The Challenge 3). On Venus, the temperature alone could liquify many metals and completely destroy spacecrafts that were sent there. Also, the pressure of the atmosphere could crush a submarine fit for diving to the deepest parts of the ocean.  In paragraph three the text illustrates,\"On the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet.\" This piece of text from paragraph three shows that we should continue studying Venus because it will allow us to learn more about the plant's harsh conditions and we would be able to see what materials could or couldn't work in such extreme heat.  The second issue, according to the people who want to stay grounded on Earth, is important for both sides to recognize. The people in the second perspective say it is not safe to go to Venus. We have tried it unmanned, and the unmanned spaceship counldn't live there for longer than a few hours, so it is too dangerous. \"On the planet\u0092s surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet. These conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth...\" (Paragraph 3). This quote helps support the second perspective for wanting NASA to kept its space ships from going to Venus. As the quote says, Venus is a very dangerous planet.  Venus may have one of the harshest climates in our solar system, with an average temperature of 800 degrees Farenheit, and an atmospheric pressure 90 times greater than Earth's. Despite these major differences, it is also believed to be the closest to Earth by means of geological similarity. As stated in the article, scientists believe that Venus was most likely covered with oceans and quite possibly could have even hosted life. This idea is gathered from the similarities in structures between Earth and that volcano of a planet, like valleys, mountains, and an atmosphere.  The next problem that Earth faces in studying Venus is that temperatures on this planet exceed 800 degrees Fahrenheit, a temperature found nowhere on Earth  but in reality, Earth and Venus are very differnet. Earth is much safer in terms of temperature, pressure, and gas compaired to Venus. Venus has a blanket of gas that covers it that is, \"almost 97 percent carbon dioxide.\" Plus, on its surface, \"temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit.\" with the level of carbon dioxide and the ragging heat that it has, nothing is safe for long on Venus, especially humans. He does state that several spacecrafts have attempted to land on Venus, and only lasted a few hours, but he doesnt state what happened to them. most people would guess that they just melted entirely because of the extreme heat, which is most likely what happened, but we don't know for sure.  Paragraph 3 of the article is all about the extreme environment that Venus presents. Venus has temperatures over 800 degress Fahrenheit, an atmospheric pressure 90 times greater than that on Earth, erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and other obstacles that prove challenging for scientists to overcome. Additionally, Venus has clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in the atmosphere which prove to be challenging to scientists. These dangers may seem impossible to overcome, but scientists have been developing new methods to further their knowledge of Venus.   In the early years of space industry, numerous spacecraft have embarked on missions to the planet, but they were not able to return home. Unlike Earth, Venus has an atmosphere that is \"almost 97percent carbon dioxide\" with a surface temperature averaging \"over 800 degrees Fahrenheit\" and an \"atmospheric pressure [that] is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet\"(Paragraph 3). Due to these extreme differences in temperature, pressure, and air content, Venus would be fairly inhospitable for humans. Usually when NASA launches missions to other planets they are trying to find alternatives habitats for the human race in the event that they cannot survive on Earth. If humans will not be able to withstand the conditions of Venus it is no longer a good option; therefore, it is not worth looking into since the author provides evidence that Venus would not be a useful living environment in the future.  The article mentions that \"A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent blankets Venus.\" As carbon dioxide is waste product of human respiration, the inhalation of this gas would be very dangerous for life to visit Venus. It also says that \"On the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Farenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet.\" Without shelter that can withold these extreme temperatures and amounts of pressure, the human body, similar to the spacecrafts, would be lucky to survive for more than a few hours. These numbers support the author's claim to focus on the horrific dangerous of exploring Venus to present a logical standpoint on this issue. ",

Second, I agree with the Electoral College despite the lack of \"democratic pedigree\" for five reasons.  In many cases there is two sides to an arguement. When there is two sides to an arguement it could go either way. In this case the arguement is about the electoral college. What is the electoral college,it is the the process, not a place. The founding fathers established it in the consitution as a compromise between election of president by a vote in congress and election of presidentby popular vote of qualilfied citizens.(stated in paragraph 1)  In summation im in favor with the Electoral College for many reasons. After reading through this side and the opponing side of the argument I can honestly say that I prefer this method as it is. Yes there is a bad side to it but there is a bad side to everything and it shouldn't be big enough for anyone to oppose it.  In conclusion, the electoral college is ineffective and outdated. we should no longer use this as a system of defining our president. Even though a winner is often more clear, there is still a possibility of a tie between candidates. People who support the Electoral College also argue that its a good thing due to swing states having more attention payed to them and therefore being more careful in their decision. However, this reasoning is flawed in that it assumes that citizens of a state are more likely to inform theirselves thouroughly simply because their vote holds more value, in a sense. Also, candidates would no longer pay special attention to swing states if the electoral college weren't in place so the votes of these citizens wouldn't be held above the rest. Increased value of votes is not a good thing, which this argument also assume. It is the best decision to abolish the Electoral College.    In conclusion, I strongly feel that we need to change to an election by popular vote.\u00a0 Above all, it is more fair to the people.\u00a0 Citizens would feel that their votes matter more than they do now.\u00a0 People wouldn't have to be worried about if the electors would flip on what they had voted for.\u00a0 Although some say its is absolutely fair throughout all the states, there are still the set backs that come along with keeping an Electoral College.\u00a0 I agree with former presidents, Nixon and Carter, that we need to abolish the Electoral College.\u00a0 All of these reasons show you the problems there are with the current system of electing our President and I know you will agree  While there have been a few flaws in the electoral college throughout history, this decision making process still unifies the people of America and is still, most importantly, part of its roots. More than anything, the electoral college process represents the two sides of the country: Congress and the average working class citizen. So, rest easy knowing that the next election, there is a process between Congress and average working citizens that works to make the decision that is best for the people of this great nation, the United States of America.  Here is a prime example, in the 2000 election Al Gore won the popular vote but because he had less electoral votes than Bush he unfourtunetly lost the election. According to Bradford Plumer \"over 60% of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now.\" It seems rather logical that if somebody gains the most votes in an election that the country would prefer that canidate to be the president. For that reason alone the reader should side with the idea to abolish the electoral college. Now besides somebody receiving more or less electoral votes, perhaps the candidates tied. In this case it gets thrown to the House Of Representitives which will cause a Wyoming Rep. with 500,000 voters to have just as much say as a California Rep. with 35,000,000 voters. All a tie would do is corrupt the voting system even more than it is. For those reasons there should be an indefinite ban on the electoral college.  In the article I read, it stated \"At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters. unfair, outdated, irrational\" I agree completely  This is why I argue in favor of changing to election by popular vote for the president of the united states.

                "content": "No, they're not directly choosing who the president is  Most states have a \"winner-takes-all\" system (with the exception ofMaine and Nebraska) that awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate in their state.(source 1) There may be an arguement that no state has enough votes to give the presidency to someone; however, this system basically casts away the other votes of those on the side of the opposing candidate, making it undemocratic. Besides that, there is also the chance that a few of the electors go rouge and vote for the opposing candidate.  With over 300 million people now in the United States, under a unified country that promotes and exemplifies democracy, we have not been democratic in the sense that peoples vote doesnt even go to their president, only to another mind that can cast you away as if you were not important. As stated in Par. 7 Source 1 an article by the Office of the Federal Register \"Most states have a winner-take-all system that awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate.\" These are the minds that are sometimes chosen at random, or by other factors to represent you, a choice you werent allowed to make. The winner takes all method only takes away from states like Texas and California who know their vote doesnt matter because these people will always agree on democratic or republican, and what is currently used in our society. This damages thousands of voices, thousands of votes that could have matter, but seemingly don't. Just like\u00a0 how schools have implemented the 'No Child Left Behind' policy, we should transcribe this to leaving no american citizen without a voice, only dependant on what state their in.  #1 fact there is a certainty of outcome by that i mean it show the popular votes. In 2012 Obama received 61.7% vote and Romney popualr vote was 51.3%.#2 is he/she have to be everybody president. He/she can't play sides like her cant just do the most for the south havt to be fair fot all of them.#3 swing states by sayig that the winner-take-all. So whoever win they take it all the awarding and everything else.#4 big states with big states the elsctoral collegethe balance all it out by the popualr votes. So it compare as a small states so u bout say its even. Last #5 it can stop and avoid run-offs when Nixon and Clinton was running it was a tied at 43%.  the person who has the popular vote may not win presidency,  The Electoral College is widely regarded as an anachronism, a non-democratic method of selecting a president that needs to be overruled by declaring the canidate who receives the most popular votes the winner. I personally think that is the best way to decide who gets in.  One, if the president was decided by popular vote, our president might not be the best one for the country.  This systen includes various methods like the \"winner take all\" system that gives the presidency to the winning candinate of the eletors votes  If we keep the electoral College then if you are elected president but do not recieve the majority of the individual votes, the president elected by the Electoral College will not be a popular president to the people who voted against them.  each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee, and that trust is rarely betrayed\" (Source 3, Paragraph 2). So when the party selects their electors they are most likely to select the candidate of the party they were selected by. There is also regional appeal,if a president only has diserably mojority of vores in a certain region of the country he is \"unlikely to be a succesful president\"( Source 3, Paragraph 5) . This is because if a president is only desired by a certain region and not the rest of the country, the wants of the rest of the country aren't met and he most likely will not tend to the needs of them, and ultimately doesn't have a chance of being selected as president. Finally, when no candidate for president has a clear majority of votes, the electoral college's votes gove a clear winner and a candidate is selected. ",

                "content": "The first inherant issue, according to people who don't want to explore Venus, is also a vital part of the arguement. They believe that we have already tried going to Venus, it failed, and why try again. They believe that we have enough information from what we can do on Earth, why do we need to know everything in the universe? They believe that we have already found enough information that we need to know.  Sadly, the author only provides one vague reason for which scientists should still try to come up with new ways to explore Venus.  . If we start looking at exploring Venus as a challenge instead of a risk, it could possibly give researchers more motivation to get out and explore.  How much value would come out of going to Venus? Scientists have tried many times to study Venus. Unfortunatley, they've always come out as failures. People could argue that the effort of studying Venus is useless and ineffective. However, scientists have little to no knowledge of how the planets in our solar system were made. Scientists could have more knowledge of Venus if they found a way to study the planet.  Venus is not worth the time, effort and resources to explore. The planet proves to be too dangerous for mankind and even for machines. Curiosity is not sufficiant enough of a reason to explore and learn about a inhospitable planet unless it is going to benefit mankind more than what it costed to gain that information. The resources that are going to Venus should be redirected to another cause that will benefit society and life as we know it.  Scientists and more specifically astronomers are extremley fascinated in Earth's sister planet, Venus, as it is similar to Earth in certain ways, and is a close enough distance for travel. Venus was believed to once be very similar to Earth in terms of its geology, so therefore scientists are interested in discovering how the features have changed. However, the author of \"The Challenge Exploring Venus,\" explains the great dangers that the planet offers for both humans and technology to explore the planet. The act of returning to Venus seems impossible due to the risks, although the insight that is wanted to be gained on the planet could lead to \"intimidating endeavors.\"  The author of \"The Challenge of Exploring Venus\", uses many scientific facts, data, and explanations to support their idea of exploring Venus. In the passage, many examples are given of why scientists would want to explore the possibilities of the contents of Venus despite all the dangers.  This way the scientists will not have to experience the total wrath of Venus's surface, but they would experince \"temperatures that would still be toasty at around 170 degrees Fahrenheit, [and] the air pressure would be close to that of sea level on Earth.\" Humans can live in those conditions, even though they may not be ideal. Scientists would be able to explore Venus without putting them at risk. There is still not technology for the scientists to throughly explore Venus the way they want to. They would only get a glimpse into what Venus is like. New inivations are being worked on that can withstand Venus's tumultous surface, so that scientists can get the full picture of  Venus.  A planet that has enough heat and pressure to melt most metals and crush any submarine may not sound like an ideal location to visit, but scientists at NASA are determined on researching it because even though it has horribly immense climate, it may be the closest planet in our solar system to Earth. The article \"The Challenge of Exploring Venus,\" the author speaks of how scientists strongly believe that learning more about Venus can lead to answers about the creation of Earth. It is an extremely difficult task to accomplish, as most rovers NASA has sent there have not lasted more than a mere few hours. In order to research the planet in depth, NASA would need to send living humans to Venus, however, this will be rediculously challenging and even more so dangerous.  After laying out the dangers of studying Venus, the author explains why scientists continue to study the planet. \"Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system\" (4). By studying Venus, astronomers and geologists can predict what might happen to Earth in the future. Gaining an understanding of Earth's future may well allow scientists to predict what happened in Earth's past. Scientists are eager to learn about the early years of Earth's past, as it is shrouded in mystery, and this thirst for knowledge motivates them to study Venus. In describing how similar Venus was to Earth, the author says, \"Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life\" (4). If there was once life on Venus, the similarity between it and Earth would grow. As with geology, if biologists can understand what caused life to cease on Venus, they might be able to predict how life on Venus and on Earth might have started. The author shows that scientists studying Venus reap the reward of being able to learn about Earth's geology and early life. By laying out the various rewards to be had from studying Venus, the author is strengthening his or her argument that Venus should be studied. ",

                "content": "For instance, if you \"lived in Texas and wanted to vote for John Kerry, you'd vote for a slate of 34 Democratic electors pledged to Kerry.\" The worst part is that the electors could be anyone you don't even have to hold a political position to be an elector, they could be very biased and narrowminded. That's why the Electoral College is unfair.  for example \"if you lived in Texas, for instance, and wanted to vote for John Kerry. You'd vote for a slate of 34 Democratic electors pledged to Kerry.\"(qoute form source 2) Those 34 Democratic electors pledged to Kerry may not win the statewide election. The voters also are not always able to control who there electors vote for. \"Legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors, and that those electors could always defy the will of the people.\" (qoute form source 2). So there a chance they may change there mind and the president they wished to win may not win because the legislatures do not have to vote in there favor. In some case seventeen states didn't even see the candidates at all. Some states including Rhode Island and South Carolina, \"and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn't get to see a single campaign ad.\"  I understand the \"wrong\" part of it like in the 2nd source it says \"If you lived in Texas, for instance, and wanted to vote for [John] Karry, you'd vote for a slate of 34 Democratic electors pledged to Kerry.\" meanning voters vote for a slate of electors and they choose the president.  Additionally, Plumer explains, \"If you lived in texas, for instance, and wanted to vote for [John] Kerry, you'd vote for a slate of 34 Democratic electors pledged to Kerry.\" Why should kerry earn 34 electoral votes. He should earn the amount of voters in that state he persuaded to vote for him. He should not earn the electoral votes of all the people that did not think he was the best presidential candidate. Every vote should count, and that is why the electoral college should be eliminated.   So that means you actually don't get to vote for the president you want, the electors get to vote for the\u00a0 president they want and their choice might not be the same as yours. Here's an example that was in Source 1, \"If you lived in Texas, for instance, and wanted to vote for [John] Kerry, you'd vote for a slate of 34 Democratic electors pledged to Kerry.\" So you don't actually get to vote for a president. Also, in source 2, it states that the electoral college is unfair to voters because of how each state has the winner-take-all system, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance in winning, focusing only on the tight races in the \"swing\" states.  For example, if you lived in Texas. And you wanted to vote for John Kerry, you'd vote for a slate of 34 Democratic electoers. Witch in most cases would be O.K., but they could betray the party and vote for whom they please. It doesn't always happen but the possibility is real.\u00a0 And people, like the segregationists back in 1960, could have gone agenst their party and pick electors to go agenst Kennedy.  In the case that you vote John Kerry in Texas, you'd vote for a slate of 34 Democratic electors pledged to Kerry. In the case those electors won the statewide election, they would go to Congress and Kerry would get 34 electoral vote. Who are the electors? They could be anyone, even if their not holding office. Who even picks these electors in the first place? Sometimes it state conventions, other times it's the state's central committee, sometimes the presidential candidates themselves. Can we, citziens of the United States, control whom their electors vote for? Not always, and that shouldn't be.   Like the example in \"whats wrong with the electoral college\" it saiys that \"if someone lived in Texas and they wanted to vote for John Kerry you'd vote for a slate of 34 democratic electors pledged to John Kerry and then John Kerry would have 34 electoral votes.\"\u00a0 If it were based on popular vote the points would be split to the person based on the number of votes they got.  So if you live in a state like Texas for example, your votes goes to 34 Democratic electors that you don't know and this can create confusion about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate. The best argument about the electoral college is the disaster factor. It happen once in 1960 where \"Louisianna legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who oppose John F. kennedy,\" Which means that those popular votes for Keenedy would not actually gone to him. Bob Dole says the electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational.  Voters can't neccessarily control who their electors vote for, you may vote for a certain slate of electors but they may still go ahead and vote for someone else. Sometimes voters get confused and may vote for a slate of electors who are for the wrong candidate. For example, in 1960 segragationists in the Louisiana Legislature almost succeded in replacing the democratic electors with new ones who would oppose John F. Kennedy, so a popular vote for Kennedy would not actually go to him. Although these things dont happen all time their is always the possibility and why take that chance on such an important event, choosing our president the person who will lead our country. ",

Although the author describes how Venus could be studied from the air, scientists still desire to learn about Venus from the planet's surface. One of their solutions to the problem of getting equipment to last on the surface of Venus is to expirement with new materials. \"Simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the choas of Venus's surface and have lasted of three weeks in such conditions\" (7). Research and experimentation taking place on Earth is giving scientists and astronauts more options for studying Venus. Although conditions on Venus are not hospitable to life, these new scientific advances are making it possible for data-gathering equipment to be sent to the surface of Venus and last long enough to gather data. Other scientists are moving away from traditional electronics and looking into purely mechanical systems. \"Systems that use mechanical parts can be made more resistant to pressure, heat, and other forces\" (7). The alternative that has presented itself to would-be explorers of Venus is older technology, like that found in the earliest computers. Scientists have realized that modern technology is too fragile and that more durable technologies are needed. By turning to other forms of technology, scientists are widening their options for ways to study Venus. The author mentions three different ways that scientists are making progress towards being able to study Venus - from the air, using new materials, and using old technologies. The author's postion that Venus should continue to be studied is supported by the scientific advancements that are serving to make studying Venus a reality.  How much value would come out of going to Venus? Scientists have tried many times to study Venus. Unfortunatley, they've always come out as failures. People could argue that the effort of studying Venus is useless and ineffective. However, scientists have little to no knowledge of how the planets in our solar system were made. Scientists could have more knowledge of Venus if they found a way to study the planet.  Many scientist are looking for a way to get samples of rocks,gas,or anthing else that they can use to find out more about venus but they cannot do that  The conflict of whether or not scientists should study the planet Venus has been up in the air, no pun intended, for sometime now. Many individuals think that studying Venus up close is too dangerous, whereas others disagree and think risks should be made.  The author does not care what kind of dangers there is because he thinks Venus is a planet that is worth to study. As he tries to get a closer look at. NASA has been also trying to help make machines and new inventions that are safe for people to go up and for themselves. Although the challenges that they have read, seen, or have heard kept stopping them from figuring out how to get closer to Venus. However, they did not give up because they kept looking for other ways to explore Venus.  This is why and how dangerous Venus can be and how there condtions are extreme. Peopel would not risk dying to get some samples from Venus or try to go to  Venus. This why its not worth to study and analize samples of Venus and later on they can try to find better material or things to help out the space ship and humans to try to land or analize any samples from Venus.  People have studied the many planets in our solar system and are fastinated by them. People have also studied the solar system to help explore and give information about the planets around us. One planet that scientists have studied for a good amount of time is Venus since it shows that at one time, the planet might have inhabited living organisms. However, Venus is a very dangerous planet since many attempts of landing spacecraft has failed on Venus and the clouds of the planet are made of sulfuric acid. Venus is not worth the pursuit of knowledge since the planet has a very dangerous enviorment for humans and that not a single spacecraft has landed safely on the planet and returned.  He explains although samples of rock, gas or anything else cannot be gathered, due to the distance, challenges can motivate scientists to progress on more ways to study Venus, to apply more knowledge. He clearly shows his opinion that the dangers should not be limited by dangers or doubts, but should drive humanity to excellence and advancement.  With more details about what they are trying to find, it would be easier to evaluate whether or not the scientist efforts are really worth it, or just a waste of time. A planet that is inhabitable by humans or anything living is already a risk as is.       ",

It might take some time out of your day but even when your helping those in need at the end of the day you really just helped yourself.  Most people feel good when they help other people, and they do it as often as they can. They might be a volunteer at a soup kitchen, donate money, pick up litter, help someone put up their groceries, or any other community service. Volunteering is a great way to help the community and anyone can do it, however volunteering is called volunteering for a reason. When you volunteer, you're willing to give up your time to help someone else.  Students can have fun with their friends while doing something for others. It is also a great opportunity for us students to make new friends, or grow closer to our old friends. This would also be a good opportunity for us students, the faculty and the teachers to grow closer as a family. If ICS were to help out at a soup kitchen, it would be fun for all of us to work together and cook, clean, and make others happy.  Community service is a way to distinguish selfish people from selfless people. Some people do large amounts of community service such as working at a soup kitchen and donating food to a food bank. Some even take it to the next level by going and helping out in places like Africa. Unfortunately not all people are open to helping people.  As Christians, we are called to administer to the needs of the poor, but if this school is not pushing for it than how are we fulfilling our duties as Christians?  Whether it's working in soup kitchens downtown or helping babysit a neighbor, we should be striving to answer our call from God.  Helping those less fortunate is a humbling experience. You learn how to be a better person and you want to try harder in life. I once worked at a soup kitchen. I saw kids just like me with parents just like mine and they were starving. I am lucky and I learned just how fortunate I was there. I know that if some of the 'bad' kids went, they would appreciate what they have and be a better student. School isn't just about math and writing its about preparing you for life. An experience like this would defiantly teach you a life lesson.  Helping the community is very important, and I'm sure many people think that. There are many citizens that volunteer for community services such as picking up litter, tutoring children, helping in soup kitchens, etc.  Some examples of community service activities that i would encourage you to suggest to the students are, cleaning trash around the school, planting new trees and plants in the park to help the environment, helping at many school sponsored events, and helping in the local soup kitchens around the community. These are some of the easier things that i recommend that you suggest the students to attend.  Now, not all community services are giving away food to the homeless, it's a simple thing such as tutoring a younger student, or cleaning up the lunchroom so all the volunteers who prepared the lunch don't have another burden on their shoulders.  Third you get to help others in need. ",

                "content": "This giant rock formation, which stretches for about two miles from end to end, isn't uncommon at all. Actually, it is a mesa which just has shadows that cast on it a certain way, which makes it look exactly like a face.  For example say people were not taking care of the environment and throwing their garbage and littering in our rivers and streams, which leads to our drink water it would then be contaminated and the contamination of the water wouldn't just effect humans it would effect plants and animals as well. Or say that we were not recycling, all of our garbage would do straight to landfill's which would once again put humans, plants and animals in danger. Or perhaps we were letting the oil from our cars run out into streams and driving our car to places that we could easily walk to or letting the carbon monoxide from our cars pollute the air leaving more of a chance for global warming to happen.  Things like the picture of the Loch Ness Moster, the famous photo that was confirmed to be faked. Another good example is the \"Bigfoot\" craze. Both cases are similar to this one because all are just photos that are hard to be certain about, that sparked international interest. Not only are they similar that way, but each one has been debunked with solid evidence.  The author shows that the huge rock formation, which resembles a human head, is formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and a mouth. The author also states that Garvin said, \"as a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger that the pixel size, so if there were objects in this picture like, airplaines on the ground, or Egytian-style pyramids, or even small shacks, you could see what they were!\"   In paragraph 12, Garvin said, \" It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about thye sane height as the Face on Mars.\" Jim Garvin is saying that these formations on Mars are very similar to the ones that we have here on Earth. He is also saying that there os no face on Mars.  On paragraph twelve, Garvin say that,\" It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho,that's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars.  It's just a rock, a plain, thousands of years old, heap of rock. The End, no \"Ifs, ands, or buts\", there is evidence saying that this is just a mesa, a landform, we have picture proof of it.  Earth, unlike Mars, has an atmosphere. It keeps in heat, but changes. Earth also has water and life. If this were to be a cause of the rocks, hills, and mountains, then it could be said that the face on Mars was not created by erosion, water, or anything like that  It does look like it could be from another living organism, but it's just a rock on the planet. In our newest image of the rock, it turns out that the face has dissapered. There is no evidence of this being created by aliens, rather it was created by wind and water that has been found on Mars. The reason you might believe that this was indeed aliens, might be the fact that the news has blown it out of poportion. It's just the rock that had some interesting shadows and holes that made it look like a human face.  The author states that scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa when the face appeared. This shows that they have seen things like this before and they knew that it wasn't real, or alien like. Another example that the author proves is that Garvin said it reminded him of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. The camera on board MGS had to peer through wispy clouds to see the face and perhaps alien markings were hidden by haze. Also NASA can be hidding information about the Face. But, you can see that the Face is formed by shadows, and not an alien haze. ",

                "content": "Vauban, an upscale community in Germany, is home to suburban pioneers who have given up their cars. Seventy percent of Vauban's family do not own cars and fifty-seven percent sold a car to move there. \"Smart planning\" is a component of the movement to seperate suburban life from auto use to create a denser and more compact enviornment and let people be more accesssible to public transportation. This means less space for parking, and more stores compactly placed and at short distances. In Bogota, \"Car-free day\" is part of an improvement campaign which helps residents of the city to see how life is life without the use of cars for a day. People use public transportation and walk to their destinations with no problem. More parks and sport centers have also been added to the area as a result of less car usage, so more space for other important things.   suburbs can become more compact and more accesible to public transportation  Dropping off your kid at daycare, then driving to work, then having to drive your child to soccer practice can be a constant and stressful cycle for most parents. Residents of suburbs that have low car usage rates claim that they are less stressful. In a suburban community with little to no motor vehicle usage, the suburb will be more compact, having more stores and buildings closer to eachother at very short distances. This makes it easier for residents to get from point A to point B quicker and more efficiently. This also allows for more walking areas with less traffic and dangerous cars to worry about.  . Reducing car usage by building public transportation and smart suburbs would be ideal.  All vehicles alike release carbon emissions into the atmosphere, polluting the air and smogging our cities. Suburbs, especially, rely on automobiles to provide needed transportion. Experts state that car transportation in suburbs \"is a huge impediment\" (Source 1) when discussing \"efforts to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipes\" (Source 1). In the car-intensive areas of the United States, passenger cars hold responsibility for \"up to 50 percent\" (Source 1) of greenhouse emissions  In the article \"Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota\" by Andrew Selsky, the changes that the Columbian city of Bogota has gone through in response to less car use are discussed. The changes are a direct result of the city's Day Without Cars campaign, where car use is banned for the whole city for one day out of a year. It reads, \"It has seen the construction of 118 mile of bicycle paths, the most of any Latin American city, according to Mockus, the city's mayor. Parks and sports centers have also bloomed throughout the city;uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks; rush-hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic; and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up\".\u00a0 These additions are in response to the city's inhabitants using alternative transport. Since cars could not be used, the public had to get to where they were heading by other means. Bogota was able to use the situation to improve itself by either fixing things already in place or adding new ones competely. Another way that a city improved itself as a result of limited car use is shown by Elisabeth Rosenthal in her essay \"In German Suburn Life Goes On Without Cars\". She writes, \"While there have been efforts in the past two decades to make cities denser, and better for walking, planners are now taking the concept to the suburbs\". One of the results of applying this idea to suburbs is that stores are placed within walking distance of houses rather than in a mall next to a highway. Vauban, the city where the changes took place, is taking advantage of the opportunities to open new stores. This change would not only create more business for the strore itself but improve the economy of the city by increasing spending. The overall impact that limiting car use has had on citites is that it provides opportunity for the city to improve itself.   \"All of our development since World War II has been centered on the car, and that will have to change\" (Rosenthal source 1) said Transportation of America official David Goldberg in Elisabeth Rosenthal's article \"In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars.\" With air pollution, smog, and greenhouse gas emissions rising all around the world, officials have announced that cars are to blame. With this, many are resorting to making changes in their communities by offering alternate means of transportation and bringing homes and stores closer together.  In \"Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota\" by Andrew Selsky, improvments to Bogota, Colombia as a result of less car usage is expaned upon. \"The day without cars is part of an improvement campaign that began in Bogota in the mid-1990s. It has seen the construction of 118 miles of bicycle paths, the most of any Latin American city, according to Mockus, the city's mayor. Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city; uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks; rush-hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic; and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have been cropped up.\" Cities are beggining to cater to the needs of those who don't\u00a0 use cars. Their negative impact on city streets is finally being recognized, and many are taking action to improve aspects where they live other than roads. In \"The End of Car Culture\" by Elisabeth Rosenthal, the author discusses the goals of the United States and its major figures to reduce total reliance on cars. In this article Bill Ford, executive chairman of Ford Motor Company shares his hopes. \"He proposed partnering with the telecommunications industry to create cities in which \"pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commerical and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected netowork to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and improve safety.\" Many are striving to make public spaces more accessable to those who choose more concious methods of transport.  Less car usage will help the enviroment as well as lower stress. \"Transportation is the second largest source of America's emmisons.\" (Source 4). By eliminating uneeded car usage and introducing more public transportation and alternate means of transport we will be eliminating one of the greatest causes of greenhouse gas emissions in America. The advantages of eliminating car usage is less pollution, healthier living and a less stressful life.  Elisabeth Rosenthal states that car usage reduction \"will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment\" (Source 4), especially in America \"since transportation is the second larget source [of emissions]\" (Source 4). Cutting down on cars for alternative, public, or group transportation provides a solution to the car epidemic of suburban America. ",

Mostly they try to change the swing states, or the smaller states because they could change from Democratic to Republican during anytime in the election. If everyone had a say in the election, more people would be inclined to vote and there would be more input into who became the next 4 year leader of this nation.  Richard Nixon, Jimmy carter, Bob Dole, and plenty of oothers think that it should change because according to a gallup poll in 2000 taken shortlyafer Al Gore he wonn the popular vote but lost the presidency dur to the quirks of the electoral college. in the Electoral College system people vote not for the prresident but for a slate of electors as i had said in the last pargrraph who in turn elect or the president. electors could be anyon not holding public office. voters sometimes control who there electors vote for. wich makes the voters sometimes get confsed about the electors wich makes them vote for the wrong candidate. In the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in the centery. in 1960 segegaters in Louisiana legslater nearly suceeddin replacing Democratic electora with new electors. So that the popular vote for Kennedy woulld not have actually gone to Kennedy. So them electors in the same vein they qould have to occasionally refuse to vote for the partys cannidate and cast a decideiing vote to who ever they please.  Would you change history? Some people think that there some things that were made by our past Presidents should be changed. Such as our Electoral College, people say it should be changed to election by popular vote for the president of the United States.  I can see how this could support changing to election by popular vote, and how it could be reasonable. If our president was chosen by popular vote, then he would visit all of the states, trying to win them over. However, there are some strong arguments against this. To begin with, one man would have to visit 50 states, and even if he only visited the majority, there is still a posibility that the state will not vote for him anyways, in the end. If we keep the Electoral College, then the majority of votes in a state would count, not his popularity. As a fourteen year old, I can relate this to highschool. A student can be the most popular student in the school, but they can also be the most rude and mean. And while another student may not be popular, they can be the nicest in the school. If the president was chosen by a popular vote, he might just end up being the worst thing that could happen to the country.  In conclusion, I strongly feel that we need to change to an election by popular vote.\u00a0 Above all, it is more fair to the people.\u00a0 Citizens would feel that their votes matter more than they do now.\u00a0 People wouldn't have to be worried about if the electors would flip on what they had voted for.\u00a0 Although some say its is absolutely fair throughout all the states, there are still the set backs that come along with keeping an Electoral College.\u00a0 I agree with former presidents, Nixon and Carter, that we need to abolish the Electoral College.\u00a0 All of these reasons show you the problems there are with the current system of electing our President and I know you will agree  Everyone has their own reason for not liking it, but sixty percent of American voters agree that we should not have it and we need to find a new system for electing presidents. Most people lost repect for the Electoral College after what happened with Bush and Gore, but many people think that it is old and outdated, and that it doesn't really make any snese to use it and that it is irrational. I'm not saying that just because a lot of people don't like something, that we should change it, I'm just explaining that if only fourty percent of the nation agrees with something, then maybe the majority should win!  If we keep the Electoral College, then even if you do earn the most individual votes, you might not be elected president. If you have earned the most individual votes then you should be elected president because you have the majority's vote.  It would then go to the House of Representatives, who might not even have the want of the people in mind. Since most of the time Congress has a party that makes up a majority of it, it would be very unfair to allow them to pick the president. It's also possible that even if a majority of the people vote for a president, the electoral votes elect the other candidate instead, like what happened to Al Gore in 2000. An election like this just has too many holes and pitfalls to be efficient. The holes need to be repaired before we can actually use this as our primary way to select a president, or else we're setting ourselves up to have problems in the future.  Everyone would get to put in their opinion on who should be the president of the United States. I think that if everyone was to be able to individually vote for their president, there would be less chaos and arguements about the election and also the new president.\u00a0But,\u00a0it is possible that the winner of the electoral vote won't win the national popular vote. But, it is very rare. Some people don't bother voting because of the fact that their vote will have no effect. They have less incentive to pay attention to the campaign than they would have if the president were picked by popular vote.  like the whole nixon thing,and Kennedy pretty much cheated on his wife with Marlyn Monroe. but,this can be stopped just with a simple petition to get rid of or change the electoral college. then,this could stop some presidents before agreed with me like Jimmy Carter,Bob Dole, and groups like the U.S Chamber of Commerce and the AFL-CIO according to source 2. Al Gore didn't win because of the electoral college,even though he won the popular vote! ",

                "content": "Talking to more people and consulting with them for advice or an opinion leads to more ideas  Different people will have different ideas and options from their perspectives on different kinds of things. It is best to decide whether or not they have the same opinions or ideas, to see if they could bond to make new decisions. Everyone that that person picks from to get advice, could have the same opinions as others or different. Depending on people you trust may have better opinions then those of the people you do not trust. This person might think that the people they do care about or know more, have more ideas to pick from and approve from because they know and trust them most.  By asking more than one person for advise on a subject, they can get more than one new idea that isn't one of their own. This way, they can get more than one person's thoughts on the decision, and have different ideas on it. For example, if someone were trying to make a decision on what sport they may want to tryout for at school, they could possibly ask their friends and family about which they should choose. However, they should also ask people like classmates and teachers, as they may have their own ideas, and won't give the person any biased ideas or information. Friends and family can have a great deal of influence on people, so it's important to always get people's thoughts that are on the outside. This will make it to where there's a greater chance of the decision maker not being biased, as they've heard numerous people's thoughts, and can make their own decision off of that.   people have different ideas,  you might receive better ideas,  Specifically, this is because having a new perspective can provoke more options for people to choose from. Seeking more advice from people with different thoughts can lead to more choices that one can consider. This is helpful because there is a bigger chance to have ideas that would make better decisions than the other. Also, one can consider things in a new way that they haven't thought about. If people are stuck with the one point of perspective that they have, this would not lead to another way of thinking. However, listening to other people for advice may help people to consider things in a way that they have not yet thought about. Therefore, the new way of thinking can turn things around into an opposite route of the original. Another example is that someone can propose an option that is better than you. Never think that you have the best idea, because there is always another creative mind that can think in a different perspective. One should get advice from these type of people, but continue to seek other opinions that may be better than the last. It is always useful to ask multiple people for advice because everyone has a different perspective that they look through.  You would receive more than one point of view by doing this and therefor a wider range of ideas.  In today's society, managers don't hire people based on their high school\u00a0grades, but on their creativity and their great ideas that they could bring to the table. If you want to become a manager of a company or even an entrepreneur, you must have great ideas. You must also be able to use your own creativity to persuade people to join your company or buy your products. Your teacher isn't going to just come up with your ideas when you get older, so why should they now. The younger you are at learning how to come up with your own ideas and how to be more creative, the more you're going to flourish as you get older.   there can be many different thoughts. Someone may suggest a better idea to you than others,  It doesn't matter if you have a mistake or two in your idea that was pointed out by someone. What matters most is that you asked people for their opinion, and having the best idea you can have. When you ask people for their opinion, it gives you inspiration, courage, and perseverance to keep on doing your best, because in the end, it can turn out to be the best thing you ever did, maybe receiving a ton of money, winning awards for your accomplishments, or meeting other famous people who also like and use your idea on a daily basis. If your idea just doesn't work out in the end, you could either ask more people for their opinion on how to revive your idea, or it can be your end to the project and give up on the idea. Either way, it can at least be the most fun you've had working on an idea in your life. ",

Don't force students into something they don't feel comfortable\u00a0with, but recommend it to them so they can think about it.  They will enjoy doing the project because it appeals to them. Since it was designed by the students, they will find joy in doing it because it was created by them in the first place and wont feel as if they are being forced to do it by the teacher. Students will also understand that its not just another project designed by the teacher. Instead, its a fun and creative way to let the students have some fun while learning. They will be enthusiastic about the project because they know its not just a huge workload put on them by the teacher to ruin their summer. Students will also be able to ask their friends for help if needed, instead of having to ask the teacher how to do everything. This is why I strongly believe that summer assignments should be student-designed, because it will be a more fun and creative way for the students to learn and it will be more appealing to them.   Instead of lazing over homework or moping around their house, children can be brighter and happier to get things done. When students are in an environment they enjoy, it can motivate them and brighten up their day. No one likes sitting in a classroom for seven hours. If students have something exciting to look forward to at the end of the day or the day after, it will push them to get their work done to participate in what they want to do.  Activities a student enjoys can introduce them to experiences they didn't know were possible. Extracurricular activities help students release stress from the hardships of their day, show them a way to think that they haven't seen before, and is beneficial for those who believe they are not intelligent. I believe that they would be helpful to students and help them excel in the future and should be required in schools.  the students that already do community service may do it for fun or they enjoy helping others, but they may not enjoy it if they are forced to do it.  Requiring participation in extracurricular activities ultimately does more harm than good to students because it disregards that broad range of activities students enjoy and takes valuable time from students who should be free to choose how to spend it. It also detracts from the value of extracurricular activities- which are created by people cooperating and acting on a common interest -by adding people who don't enjoy the activity. Inspiring students to be curious and passionate should be the school's priority, but by requiring students to do an extracurricular club the schools are only boxing students into a mold that ignores the complexity and individuality of each person. Students are required to get an education that will help them survive as adults, but they should be able to decide which hobbies and skills they want to specialize in. In the end, the unique path they decide to carve out for themselves should be of their own making.  Creativity is an important part of every child's\u00a0life, not being able to use it will make a child dull. For example, when someone does not practice or use something they often lose their ability to do it. Additionally, student-designed projects would let students show who they really are and what they enjoy. When students can show who they really are they feel happy and good about themselves. Also, when they can express what they enjoy they will attract other classmates that enjoy the same thing. Having friends that enjoy the same thing they do will not only improve their happiness but will also improve their work ethic towards what they enjoy. For example, I am in very demanding and somewhat difficult classes. Having friends in the same classes as me with the same goals makes it a lot easier. Without them I would most likely not work nearly as hard.  Having a good life should be enjoying what you do and be excited about where you are and how you live your life. Having others options can benefit your life by asking where to visit in the world or where to travel to. Other opinions will also, help you realize your consequences. You may not know you are making a bad choice, but by getting others intake you will realize if you are making a good or bad choice. A parent or guardian is always a person to go to if you are not sure if you are making a bad choice or not. A teacher or school counselor can help with problems too. All of these people can give you advice that will most likely help you.  They could make it something they understand and can learn at their own pace while also learning about something they enjoy. They can finally be set free and be given the power and choice to learn a pursuing subject, but also have something that conforms to their personal needs.  What better way to relax then do something you enjoy with other people that enjoy it as well. Playing a sport after school can help you create close friends and teammates. When you think about stress reliving one of things you might think of is one of your favorite things to do with some of your friends. Well guess what, you just explained what a club is. In that portion of your day you don't have to worry about acing that test all you have to think about is swishing that three or winning that chess match.  ",

Taking away the need for human drivers in vehicles will take away great memories, fun adventures, and many valuable skills that peple can gain while driving a car. These cars also can cause many safety issues including accidents from the lack od the cars ability to handle certain situations and could also cause issues if the drivers of these cars fall alseep when there is a sitiuation where there is a need for a human driver. RIght now these cars do not have enough safety features and they do not have enough driving capability to be safe for public use. If the manufactoring companies continue to work on these cars and make improvements, then these cars might not be completely bad, but as of right now they are not safe enough or skillled enought to be sent out to the pubic.  a life without cars means a healthy, long-lasting planet along with a happy, relaxed, and healthy population. Even though cars are conveint, they have many negative side effects. Next time you want to go for a ride, think of all the benefits of limiting them. Rember what a breath of fresh air feels like because the gasses from cars might mean they will be gone soon. Get used to angry faces honking horns, and being given \"the bird\" by angry drivers because with cars come many conveiniences, but also many frustations.     From Monster trucks to Volkswagen Beetles, all automobiles are created to make life easier for people from all corners of the Earth. Many people start up their cars everyday without a second thought, whether trekking across the street or across the country. Others believe that cars are ruining the Earth, and put effort toward decreasing their car's \"footprint\" on the environment.  There are situations there a person is the best option. Unless the car can think for it self. The drivrless car is too unpredicatable and can put peoples lives in danger. Accidents occur all the time, i don't believe a driverless car can avoid an ongoing accident. Then there are situations with police, or stolen cars. Would the car give away its owner if they were on the run from the police? How would traffic stops work, would the car be so perfect to not break the law? The car could be harboring fugitives or runways or even kidnapped victims. The car wouldnt be smart enought to know, its going to do what its told and drive.  The American lifestyle, some might say that it is hardworking and free, others howeveer might say that we are lazy. I have to agree with both, we have many citizens that are very hardworking and strive to do their best and improve themselves and others. Sadly that is not all of out citizens, we have a gigantic amount of people in our contry that are lazy, they do not want to work for anything, and expect everything in life to be given to them without them putting forth any more effors than applying for some things online. If the automobile manufactorers release a car that drives itself, that will just be one more thing that the lazy americans do not have to do. It would be another thing just handed to them that they would not have to work for. These cars are made by the hardworking to make life for the lazy easier. I do not think that this is something that needs to happen or something that should even be considered.  \"It's a good opportuntiy to take away stress and lower air pollution, \"said businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza as he rode a two-seat bicycle wiht his wife\"(Selsky, \"Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota\"). Without cars theres people walking along the side walks talking, people not having to worry about saftey on the road as much, people riding bicycles and skateboarding, and just a great way to excerise just by walking outside. \"The rain hasn't stopped people from participating,' said bogota Mayor Antanas Mockus\"(Selsky, \"Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota\"). The fact that people dont care about the rain makes me think that people are enjoying this car-free day and there's no reason to stop it.  Driving without driveless cars was a joy and something people love to do but with driveless cars it ruins the experinece as you do not get to control the car anymore and just have to watch it drive itself. This has been a big problem for car companies as they have to get people to buy their car and enjoy the ride and the car and companies do not know how to do that. Werner Huber who is the BMW project manger said that with cars being able to drive by themselves they have to find new ways to attract and make the costumers enjoy the car and they can not find a way to do that without putting the driver adn the passengers at risk. The only things they have founded to make the car enjoyable to drive with driveless cars is entrainment systems or texting but all these may be enjoyable to the driver but also puts the driver at risk.  To justify my argument that everyone should be against the development of these driverless cars, just think about if it was you. These cars can not be pradictable and no one can be postive what will really happen. But what if it was you who got hurt or maybe a family memeber, because they let these unsafe and unperdicable cars out onto the roads. You would have no one to blame because it was just a machine or just a accendent. They are never meant to hurt but everyone would rather be safe than sorry. Make the right choice and do whats right to keep people safe, not to make their lives easier.  Cars in most countrioes are the leading pollutants and it could be wise for people to try and reduce smog, greenhouse emissions and diesel use by not picking up tthe keys to your car.  Section eight of the passage focuses on the psychological aspects of driverless cars, and introduces thd idea of laziness and boredom in human nature. Later on, the author states that some manufacturers hope to address this problem by including entertainment in the cars to remedy this boredom. Bringing in car entertainment wuld only further distract the now obsolete human drivers from the road, which in the case of an emergency, could prove fatal to not only the driver, but the passengers in the car as well. The Google car mentioned in section 7 \"Announces when the driver should be prepared to take over\". If the human did not hear the car announce this, and the car was reverted to the drivers control, the driver might end up in a crash. ",

                "content": "In 1976 NASA released a photo of a landform on Mars resembling a human face. Not everyone was easily convinced that it was only just a landmass though. Conspiracy theorists believed that it was, \"Bona fide evidence of life on Mars.\" In the article \"Unmasking the Face on Mars,\" the author, Garvin, believed that it was only a mesa.  When the face on Mars was originally captured, there was no such thing. The article explains that when the picture was originally captured in 1976, the camera quality was not great. For example the text states, \"Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo.\" So, when given a better camera quality than in 1976, the face on mars no longer looks like a defined face. Although the quality of the camera is a great support, there are many other explanations that put an end to conspiracy theorists.  So, while some conspiracy theorists would like to think that aliens created this well-known face on Mars, they are incorrect. The face on Mars is just a natural landform that was wrongly perceived by the public. By advancing in digital technology, understanding the effect of shadows, and realizing that there is no evidence to support aliens on Mars, it can be concluded that the face on Mars is just another peculiar natural landform.  The author states that scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa when the face appeared. This shows that they have seen things like this before and they knew that it wasn't real, or alien like. Another example that the author proves is that Garvin said it reminded him of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. The camera on board MGS had to peer through wispy clouds to see the face and perhaps alien markings were hidden by haze. Also NASA can be hidding information about the Face. But, you can see that the Face is formed by shadows, and not an alien haze.  Even thoug hmy colleague still believes in the \"Face on Mars\" to be a alien made structure. I still believe it's only a butte or mesa. With my evindence of the \"Face on Mars\" only looking like a face due to the techonology of the time, the shadows of the sun, the angle the picture was taken, and our ability to see faces when none are there, I believe I have conclusive evidence that the \"Face on Mars is nothing but a butte or mesa.  In 1976 the face looked like a face. In 1998 it started to not look like a face at all. In 2001 it just looked like a rock. So i believe that it was not created by aliens but that it was just something the olanet had made itself. This has certainly got the attention of the people.  The \"Face on Mars\" is not a face. If you look at the pictures from 1976, and 1998, and 2001 and in the text it says that the photo from 2001 is the most recent photo that NASA has. It still looks nothing like a face so since the 2001 picture is the most recent it shows that it is just a natural landform. It is just a natural landform. On Mars there are natural landforms everywhere and the fade away. Here on earth natural landforms are created everyday.  In 1976, the Viking 1 spacecraft was orbiting the planet of Mars, and it was taking new pictures for all of mankind to see. As it was passing over a strip of Mars called Cydonia, it snapped a picture that would cause an uproar in space exploration. This new picture showed what seemed to be a human face. A few days later NASA reveled these pictures for the world to see; it was an instant hit  Some of the biggest tricks played are constructed by the eyes. When the first image of the face on Mars was revealed, the features such as the eyes and nose were most likely created by shadows. In the article it explains, \"A few days later NASA unveiled the image for all to see. The caption noted a 'huge rock formation...which resembles a human head...formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth.\"  n paragraph 10 it says,\" ...43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo.\" This shows that the photo didn't give very compelling evidence that there was life on Mars. soon later NASA and their supporters claimed that this face is just an act of nature is because of the 1998 Global Surveyor spacecraft. This new spaceship passed over the red planet to take pictures of the \"face on Mars\". The pictures were ten times better than the last pictures of Cydonia this time. The new photos clearly showed a landform on Mars and not a man.  Are you ready to accept the truth about the Face on Mars? I have listed valid, credible arguments including the high resolution of the 2001 photo, and the weak resolution of the 1976 photo. I also questioned the logic of extra-terrestrial life, and the logic that NASA would have used to cope with the discovery of aliens. ",

                "content": "In today's society, things are growing and changing at a rapid rate. There are new technological advances and new ideas and innovations that come into this world everyday. One particular subject that comes in mind is the idea of online courses. These courses are mainly for people who do not have easier access or any type of transportation to school which can lead to be very useful. People love this idea and innovation of school and think students could genuinely benefit from this. Undoubtedly, there are a lot of flaws to this, the one major problem that stands out the most is it could cause students to take advantage of these online courses and cheat by using another browser to look up their answer's and could lead to long-term consequences.  but with time, things change, and just because we've used something for a long time, doesn't mean we shouldn't upgrade.  Driving a car can be very difficult sometimes with all the traffic, getting a phone call, not seeing a pedestrian and many other things that a driver has to be aware of when driving. As technology keeps improving these cars keep improving as well. These driverless cars could make driving easier for humans, more enjoyable and more safe and they could also change the world and the way we live by providing us with all these advantages that are not available at the moment. Manufacturers should keep improving these cars and the states should change the law and make the driving of these cars legal.       There are millions of wrecks in the U.S. every year, some due to their own cars not being very reliable. Cars and their manufacurers must be very reliable when it comes to bringing up new models of vehicles. Imagine if you could cut the number of car wrecks in half. Technology is fast pacing and is advancing every day. What if we could have driverless cars, cars that could not only make the world a better place, but also prove how amazing our technology is.  Education like many things has had a traditional way of being however, like many things nowadays that tradition is prone to change and it is for the better. Technology is one of the most important and useful tools in todays society and schools are already utilizing it and it utilized even more so by home schoolers. Since the courses are essentially entirely online, teachers can use many online softwares to create fun, educational, and dynamic learning activities rather than simply assigning worksheets or textbook work. The online systems can help students with writing papers and with calculations in math all while explaining why things work the way that they do making the teacher's job even easier  Today, technology is rapidly advancing virtually everywhere. The iPhone, electric cars, large appliances, and many more useful new technological inventions have improved and helped assist everyone with their everyday tasks in a quick and resourceful manner. The new technology of the modern world is in workplaces, homes, and best of all, schools. Technology in school has rapidly increased especially as every student at Generic_School now has their own laptop for their own educational use. Now every student can get their work done through a computer at school, but not every student or teacher prefers it. Therefore, today, some schools offer distance learning for students to attend classes from home by way of online testing and course learning on their own. Many students and especially parents are skeptical of these online distance courses because they think that the old fashioned way of staying in school and using paper and pencil is the optimal way of learning. On the other hand, many people think otherwise, so this has become a great debate in the system of education for many counties and individual schools.  Times are changing. Driverless car technology is being created, with slow and steady progress. The technology for these type of cars has only been developed over the last few years because of a lack of technology. There are several companies trying to develop these cars, but they're pretty much at the same step. Knowing how driverless technology works, who is liable for damages, and how it will effect drivers is crucial to the possible future use of driverless cars.   Finally, either it be the fact that a lesson can be changed based off of if a student is bored or confused. Or that having this technology can show students a wider range of possible job choices, hobby choices, or just learning more about something out of pure intrest. Or lastly, because having this technology around us gives us a reason to talk about the science of emotion in depth. This technology could be extreamly useful, and impactful on students, if the software being used is good and has been shown to be correct. This could be a very good thing to have in schools that our students can use and to possibly even learn about.  The human body has way more than just six emotions so getting a high accuracy reading on how you are really feeling is out of the question because FACS uses the a process of a 3-D model Dr. Huang states \"The process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D model of the face; all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles.\" This quote explains that it has to use a way of making a model which can sometimes take some time depending on the processing power of the computer not only that but human emotions can change quite quickly and if the pc doesnt make the model fast enough the computer can easly fail at getting and accuarate reading.   In conclusion, if these \"driverless\" cars are allowed to continue to be tested and improved upon, countless lives will be saved and human efficiency will increase. As this fantastic technology is improved upon, the negative aspects of trial and error, restrictive laws, and cost will only decrease. As for the future, human culture as we know it will change to alot this new technological enhancement into our everday lives, and in the process, potentially save thousands of individuals with ever purchase of a new \"smart\" car.

Seagoing Cowboys help animals, mostly horses, donkeys, cows, and mules, that are being shipped overseas to avoid harm get to their destination. Are you thinking that you maight like being part of this program?  maybe you don't even know if it is bad advice that is why always get more than one person to get advice from. Now for an example: You just turned twenty and you're still living with your parents so you go to your bad friend house because you think he has cool job probably. So you get to his house then ask him and he says you could join my gang we do cool things and get a lot\u00a0a money you think about talking to your other friend but then you say yes anyway. The next day you go to jail for murder because your friend comited murder to rob a bank. You were sitting in a car waiting\u00a0for your friend to get out of the bank you didn't think that he hurt or robed anyone. Now you in prison for forty years and your friend for life. When you were about to get your good friends advice you didn't but if you did you would realize how bad of an idea that is and would of been fine, so never be to careful.  But, it is not smart to give students complete freedom as they will have someone who wants something specific out of them when they get a job. For example, when I got my first job at an ice cream store I had to figure things out myself as I went, but I could not just do whatever I wanted. I had a task to complete that was specified by my boss, but he was not there every step of the way and left me to figure some things out on my own. That is what summer projects should emulate for high school students, while projects should be much more structured for younger kids.  People feel differently about lots of different things, whether they are small issues like shoes being ugly, or big issues like political opinions and whether schools should have dress code. What if someone wants to buy a Cadillac. Obviously, Cadillacs\u00a0are expensive and the person would ask somebody before spending their hard earned money on a Cadillac. If the person asks their best friend who thinks they are ugly if they should get a Cadillac, they would obviously say no. The best friend has an opinion on Cadillacs. If the person had asked somebody who thinks Cadillacs are amazing, they would say to buy it. This is an example of why asking multiple people before making a choice is good because they might have different opinions. If someone wants to open a donut\u00a0shop, but their uncle hates donuts. When they ask their uncle if they should open a donut shop, he will say no. He has an opinion of thinking donuts taste gross. But when they ask their sister who loves all desserts and will always support her sibling. She will say yes because she has an opinion of loving sweet foods and her siblings. This is an example of why people should ask more than one person before they do something. The student president might want to start a book club. A lot of students a do not like books because their teacher made them read a boring book three years ago and they have not liked books since then, they have an opinion on books from a long time ago. The teachers, on the other hand, love this idea because they think that students these days do not get enough reading time in and a book club would be a good idea. If the student president would not have asked the teachers if they liked the idea there would be no book club  One reason they might not be able to do community service is because they might have a love one that is sick at home and they have to be there for there aid. Second reason is because a student might have financial problems at home were they may have to take on a part time job after school to help around the household with payments. The final reason is that student there self may have health issues forbidding them from doing any community service. Those are the reasons why a student may not be able to do community work after school because of personal issues.  Another person who illustrates this is my same friend Generic_Name, who had a demanding part time job at a cafe during the morning of school weekdays in order to finacially support her family. Since she took her academic courses online, she was able to have a flexible shift and work for longer hours because there was no given time that she had to be present in class. If she had not been doing school through online means, it would not have been possible for her to take on the job at an hour where most students are actively learning in school.  Sometimes teachers may assign a lot of homework to their students. Sometimes if students have multiple teachers, the students may have homework from different subjects. Or students may have to finish classwork that they did not finish from class. Also projects can keep a student busy because students may have from 1 to 2 projects to do at home. Study guides also play a role because students may have upcoming test, quizzes, benchmarks, and midterms to pass. Some parents may own a restaurant or a shop and their kids may have to work at the restaurant or shop. students can also have tutoring, babysitting, other sports, and taking care of a loved one. However there are many more things that can\u00a0keep a student busy after school.  For example in my own life I have made some of my best friends through the public school system. In third grade I met a kid named Generic_Name and over the years because we went to the same school we became close friends and he even hooked me up with a job last summer. In seventh grade I had a less than desirable English teacher whose monotone voice made him sound like he came straight out of a charlie brown cartoon. Because of him I met a guy named Generic_Name who I quickly befriended because our shared hate toward our English teacher, and now I get a free movie sometimes when Generic_Name is on staff at the Regal movie theater, who I never would have meet if we didnt go to the same school.  Generic_Name is a part of his high school's student council. Part of his job is to work with others to cultivate ideas for school programs. The council has taught him the importance of expressing his opinions and ideas. The council has made Evan much more confident about his opinions and now expresses them throughout daily life. A student council is not the only activity that can boost your communication skills. Those skills will increase anywhere that\u00a0you are working together, which is usually any activity. By improving your communication skills, you are preparing for the future. You will need to be able to have excellent communication skills during college, work, and just daily life. In addition, you could make many friends. According to the Brain Like Mindedness Observation Assessments, people with the same interests typically make better friends. A club is just a bunch of people gathered together doing an activity that they enjoy. There are plenty of chances to make a friend. So next time nobody wants to join a club with you, don't worry. Once you get there you will make many friends.  A popular story at Generic_School, is one of a student who had a below average GPA, but had a fantastic relationship with his Business teacher. He was accepted into a prestigious Ivy league school and after calling them, he found out he was accepted based off of his teacher recommendation. This story shows how having personal relationships with teachers is very beneficial. An online course teacher does not have this same bond as an in-school teacher, and this represents one of the many possible cons. Overall, relationships with teachers has a very crucial and important role in a students life. ",

The proof is in the article when you see the 3 picutes that were taken to prove it wasn't a alien made artifact. No matter how cool it would be if it was not to mention that it could make NASA famous or rich it just doesn't have the proof you need to be a alien artifact. If you look more into the passage it even says it was not a alien made artiffact. Yes this face was very famous it even says \"The \"Face\" on Mars has since been a pop icon. It has starred in a Hollywood film, apperered in books, magazines, and even radio shows.\" (5). See how famous that face was 25 years ago is amazing but it still doesn't mean it was a alien made artiffact. So in final say it is not a alien made face and nor will there be enough proof its just a landmark on Mars that was very popular to people everywhere!            For example, most of the movies or television shows people see, it always revolves around doing the right thing and making the right decision, but when the teenagers really come face to face with community service, most of the would be either annoyed or disgusted.  Things like the picture of the Loch Ness Moster, the famous photo that was confirmed to be faked. Another good example is the \"Bigfoot\" craze. Both cases are similar to this one because all are just photos that are hard to be certain about, that sparked international interest. Not only are they similar that way, but each one has been debunked with solid evidence.  Celebrities have talked in their interviews about them choosing home school over school and how beneficial\u00a0it was to them.  they can incorporate their real-world knowledge and experience,  The author also stated in paragraph seven that in 1998 that the photo was retaken with a higher quality camera.  Many prodcasts on the radio have mentioned many real life situations on this subject .  prodcasts\u00a0i've watched on the radio  Giving students the thumbs-up to style and create their own work assignment suddenly sets the bar way higher.  . For example, the famous filmmaker and entrepreneur Walt Disney was not always successful with his work. At the start of his career he drew little art work pieces for a small local newspaper company, although he wasn't able to profit from his drawings that much, he still loved his job because it was something he wanted and loved to do. It can be seen that people are able to go through tough times if they are able to express themselves freely. Another example would be is when my science class was assigned a group project and students had the freedom to do whatever they wanted to do. My group decided to do it on climate change, which wasn't very appealing to me at the time, but as I learned and dug in deeper into the topic, I found it more and more interesting which led to me being more educated in climate change and gaining new knowledge made it was more memorable. This shows that when students have the freedom to choose and design their own projects; it helps students learn something they never knew about, which leads to students being more educated. ",

The Electoral College is an unfair way of choosing presidents, by it being known as a winner-take-all system. Stated in the passage, \"Candidates don't spend time in the states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the swing states.\" The candidates in the \"lame\" states did not even see a single campaign ad. The swing states have a higher chance and more likely to see their campaign ads, because they are the more popular states. The more popular states are \"the most thoughtful votes, and should be the ones to decided the election.\" Swing states get campaign ads, they are the ones who are being favored, while there are other states just trying to get a campaign sign, and get their votes recognized.  While some may still believe that the Electoral College is outdated and unneccesary, the usefulness of the swing states, its transregional approval system, and its certainty over popular voting proves it to be the best method of selecting our presidents for now and for the future.       \u00a0       \u00a0     \"It's official: The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational,\" says Bradford Plumer, and he couldn't be closer to the truth. The electoral college system does not represent the people of America accurately and is more likely to result in a tie compared to the popular vote. To conclude, source 3 says the electoral college is \"a non-democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be overruled by declaring the candidate who receives the most popular votes the winner  In conclusion, the Electoral College and its electors must be disbanded so that popular vote will be used in determining the new president of the United States. According to both Source 2 and 3, the process of voting a group of people to vote for you is un-democratic. Electors, the people making up th Electoral College, can be manipulated and coerced into voting a specific candidate. Lastly, non-swing states will be ignored; this will anger and frustrate them since not one candidate tried to persuade them. Florida State Senator, you must, in the best of your ability and then some, try to topple down the un-democratic roots of the Electoral College. The people, the ones who must truly decide on the president, will be immensely greatful towards you; in a 2000 poll, 60% of the voters even stated that they want a popular-vote type of election.  In conclusion, the Electoral College seems unconstitutional, since a variety of issues can occur due to the many problems that could potentially occur. The United States should shift into a more reasonable and logical means of electing our president in our Republic, where everybody is equal. The Electoral College should no longer decide the president based on the possibility of a tie, the possibility for betrayal of trust and disputes due to how close the votes are. The system should change to where the popular opinion should\u00a0 decide on the president of the United States of America, making people believe that their vote will be fairly counted.  The Electoral College is an outdated system of voting. There are few weak reasons why it should be carried out as the nations voting process. The United States of America should change to election by popular vote for the presidency.  I believe that we shouldn't change the Electoral College for popular votes the way we arevoting now is working just fine and it makes it so larger states like Texas don't get more of an impact on the election because of thier population than smaller states like Rhode Island. Also the Electoral College prevents Run-off elections. Even though some believe the Electoral College as an anachronism I think that the Electoral College is still a good way of voting.  In this system, according to the second source, popular vote, which is what the majority people select, most of the time loses the election due to the Electoral System. An Example used in this source was the 2000 election with Al Gore, he had won the popular vote, but had lost the election thanks to the Electoral College. With this system in play, voters cannot control who they want to vote for and that is not how it should be. In source one, it clearly states most states have a \"winner-take-all\" type of system that awards all electors of that state to the specific candidate, which is the complete opposite of benefiting the people, because not everyone in that state wants to vote for that specific candidate. Source 3 says big states that a larger state gets more attention than a smaller state does because of the amount of votes, however some states claim they never even got to see a presidential campaign had because of how small the states was. Its is Unfair to these states which include Rhode Island, South Carolina. It takes away opportunities from these smaller states.  The Electoral College is a controversial topic in the US. This is the system used to elect the president of the United States, but most people (60% of Americans, according to source 1) believe that we shouldn't use this particular system and that we should go with the popular vote instead, while all others are strong in their stance that we should continue its use  In conclusion, the Electoral College should be replaced by the popular vote system as soon as possible. The Electoral College relies on archaic methods to make tallying votes simpler for the government, which results in problems. It's like the government is rounding the votes. The winner-takes-all method of the Electoral College can render a voter's vote completely useless, and it even allows representatives to vote for the presidential candidate that is against the voter's wills. Presidential candidates will not bother campaigning in states that are loyal to their adversary or are too small to be worth their time. While a single person's opinion might not seem important, or rounding votes seems \"easier,\" no corners should ever be cut when deciding who the leader of a nation with over 50 million citizens is, which is why the Electoral College should be replaced by the popular vote system.

                "content": "For example , we need to forces on more important things such as school work and maybe after school activates. I think we shouldn't be able to have our phones because 50% of students that have cell phones fail there classes because while the teacher is explaining something important the student us either messing around or texting another student which is not only affecting he/she but others around them.  If students do use their cell phones, they will not be paying attention to the teacher or what they need to know. Without the second policy, students' grades will drop lower and lower because they are not learning what they need to. This is just one more reason why the only way to go is to ban phones in schools at all times.  Students may feel they are being rewarded with a little free time by having their cell phones out. If this opportunity is given 99% of students may do better in school. Many may think this just gives students a way to have their cell phones out without getting in trouble for it. However, students are actually very responsible and may do the right thing.  For example if we could have our cell phones out nobody would be thinking of the lesson or would even bother to tune into the class because obviously a phone is a perfect way to chat with your friends while the teacher isn't looking. This makes it difficult for the person sending the messages AND the one receiving them because both are having their attention pulled away from what's important (class) and what's not (socializing). Another example is even if the rule says that cell phones can only be used during free time students will be using them all the time ignoring the rule. Honestly anybody can quickly put the phone under the table and text a quick message to their friend but in that short second the teacher could've been explaining something crucial to the development of the students skills. And just missing that one little thought the student is now behind because of it. As you can see cell phones will be a major disruption to the students if allowed for them to have them in school.  Cell phones are huge distractions in school. They lead to high school drop outs because of their grades and, not to mention, they lead to low income. If we let students use cell phones more in school they may get the thought they can do whatever they want. We need to put a stop to this now so our future generations will be able to support their families.  As a current student in middle school, I have learned how children use cell phones. If you are reconsidering the cell phone policy, I believe the second one is the only way to go. Children in this school may sneak their cell phones into class without the teacher ever knowing if they are not banned. This will also lead to students doing poorly in class because they won't be paying attention to the teacher. Also, the use of cell phones in a wrong way can cause a student to get hurt. Overall, I believe your second policy to ban cell phones in class is the best choice because after being a student in school, I know what will happen if they are allowed in school.  Sometimes, when a student isn't able to call a parent, they end up waiting for an hour or more outside the school until he/she is picked up from school. Students need to be able to use cell phones for situations like these, especially when they much homework to complete for school because then they have less time to do their required work.  Cell phones are going to take learning away from students if they have there phones with them all the time.  If something terrible were to happen to a students family, they should be able to contact the student immediately. How could they do so without a cell phone? This also true if it were backwards, and there was an emergency at school. If something were to happen that left the school's administration physically unable to hell the students, how could students get help? With cell phones, they would be able to contact their families and emergency medical services.  I think that if you allow students to use cell phones during free times, they will abuse this rule and sneak their phones to class ",

                "content": "In conclusion, some people may think there is alien life on Mars because of past picture or conspiracy theories. No one can denty however, that NASA has proven the Face to be nothing but a natural landform on the Red Planet Mars. NASA has proven this by recent pictures, scientific evidence, and real-life examples and measurements. Over the years, NASA has worked hard to figure out the mystery of the face, and just recently they have discovered, with pictyures, evidence, and measruements, that the Face is just a natural landform with unusual shadowing formed on the Red Planet Mars.  In 1976 NASA released a photo of a landform on Mars resembling a human face. Not everyone was easily convinced that it was only just a landmass though. Conspiracy theorists believed that it was, \"Bona fide evidence of life on Mars.\" In the article \"Unmasking the Face on Mars,\" the author, Garvin, believed that it was only a mesa.  On the contrary, some people believe that the face is \"\"Bona fide\" evidence of life on Mars--evidence that NASA would rather hide, say conspiracy theorists\" (p. 5).  In the end, the landform was found to be a Martian mesa. There are many mesa's in the region of Cydonia and that's a part of how we found out how it was a natural landform. Also the Surveyour verified that there wasn't any other monuments near the landform. If there was any life on Mars we would want to tell the people so they can be intrested in the activity at NASA, but for now there has not been found any life activiy on Mars.    The curiousity about Mars has been going on for centuries.  People say that there is or once was life on Mars, and now they are saying that there is a face on Mars.  Humans all around the world have questioned whether the \"Face\" was created by aliens or just a natural landform.  There is no form of life on Mars, otherwise, NASA would have detected in years ago.  n paragraph 10 it says,\" ...43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo.\" This shows that the photo didn't give very compelling evidence that there was life on Mars. soon later NASA and their supporters claimed that this face is just an act of nature is because of the 1998 Global Surveyor spacecraft. This new spaceship passed over the red planet to take pictures of the \"face on Mars\". The pictures were ten times better than the last pictures of Cydonia this time. The new photos clearly showed a landform on Mars and not a man.  People are facinated with the Man on the Moon and the idea of Martians, but most people do not think about life on Venus. Venus is the second planet from the sun and shares many geographical features with Earth. However, studying this planet is made difficult by the dense and toxic atmosphere, high temperatures, and violent weather. Despite this, some people think that Venus should still be explored, and the author of \"The Challenge of Exploring Venus\" is of this opinion.  It does look like it could be from another living organism, but it's just a rock on the planet. In our newest image of the rock, it turns out that the face has dissapered. There is no evidence of this being created by aliens, rather it was created by wind and water that has been found on Mars. The reason you might believe that this was indeed aliens, might be the fact that the news has blown it out of poportion. It's just the rock that had some interesting shadows and holes that made it look like a human face.  The world today contains numerous conspiracy theories. One of these conspiracies is about the mysterious face on Mars. Some conspiracy theorists state that the face on Mars is actually a result of Alien life. ",

And again they might even get an even bettere and bigger because of the technology we have today. It might be even in high definition so that they can see if thats actually a face or if its just a mountain with craters. But they might get me wrong and thats ok but as long as they have a better camera to explain how or what i'm right about. Like in the beginning of this article it said that they had take pictures in 1976, 1998, and in 2001 but all of those pictures are on cameras that make pictures blury and in order to see if the picture was actually a face they had to do something to make that picure clearer than it shows.  Students may also use this feature in art classes to really capture what the artist was depicting in the work. For instance, this new software was able to create percentages of Mona Lisa's emotions. The latest innovation in computer software may be very useful for art classes, knowing how a person may be feeling in a painting may help students to depict the artists work, a bit better. As humans, we can tell how someone may be feeling by the look on their face, or the look in their eyes. Most of us would have trouble trying to describe what facial expressions convey being happy, besides a smile. The computer can make exact percentages on each emotion you may be feeling.  With advanced technology, the right location, and the right season, NASA got the clear picture of the Face they needed to show that it was just a landform.  NASA even suggests that it may be a butte or mesa  As discussed before, NASA has taken a new and better quality photo of the Face in Cydonia. Using our scientific equiopment at NASA, we have proven just how much better the resolution is on the new phototgraph taken is. \"\"As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger that the pixel size,\" he added. So if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the gtround or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!\"\" (p. 11). This quote from the article shows  Leonardo Da Vinci was one of the greatest reniassance painters of the time. His study of the human anatomy allowed him to create pictures that captured the humna state. On of his most well known paintings is the \"Mona Lisa\". The Mona Lisa is a women that has sort of complacent facial features. She doesn't really look happy or sad. This was the popular thought up until a new technology was created. This technology is called the Facial Action Coding System. This technology is able to deduce what emotion a person is feeling. It is able to do this whothout the person even showing an obvious emotion. This technology can also be implenmented in many spheres of life, including in the classroom.  The implications of technology that can detect emotions simply by reading the muscles in the face sound truly remarkable. The thought that one can tell what another is thinking simply by plugging data or maybe even a picture into an algorithm sounds like fiction, but may soon be a reality. The article, \"Making Mona Lisa Smile\" by Nick D'Alto briefly discusses the possible use of such technology in a classroom. The system could examine student's faces, and if they read to be unengaged or uninterested, could adjust the lesson to make learning more interesting to that group of students. That type of technology could revolutionize learning, and customly tailor lesson plans to the feelings of students on any given day.  Dr. Huang is talking about the device using video images to pick up the emotions of each person. Dr. H states \"using video imagery, The new emotion recognition software tracks these facial movments in a real face or on a painted face.\" This quote brings to light that the machine can read emotions but one could say since it is still in new development that not all of the bugs or glitches have been worked out not only that but you also have to devote more resources to keep the machine working which can average to be a heafty hit to your wallet.  According to the article \"Making Mona Lisa Smile,\" there is a new technology called the Facial Action Coding System (FACS) that enables computers to identify human emotions. This technology is relatively brand new. It creates a 3-D computer model of all fourty-four major muscles in the face that move like human muscles as well. Then, psychologists have classified six basic emotions that are associated with different movements in the facial mucles. This new technology could result in many benefits in our community as well as all around the world  There is so much wasted potential if the system is put into a classroom.  we could use this technology for bigger and better things. For instance better facial recognition security systems so it can be more accurate reading faces and does not open or let in anyone that looks like the person. Or lock the person out of anything that is protected by facial recognition. Another example of how this could be useful in other ways is the facial recognition can be used in the police force to find a match of a person that was caught on camera to be tracked down and captured.  The highly inteliigent Facial Action Coding System a valuable asset for students in a classroom, as it fosters an enjoyable and captivating learning environment that will shape the students' commitment to school. This advanced software analyzes the movement of a human's facial muscles, comparing it to an emotionless one, and determines the percent distribution their feelings. This innovative software provides students with the ability to customize the pages and lessons on the computer, giving them control over their method of learning. Students with this ability will feel captivated by their learning, as they are in control and can decide how they learn. The development of a desire to learn is crucial for school-aged children so that in the future, they will continue on to further educate themselves and expand their knowledge. This facial  -analysis technology provides schools with the ability to create a captivating learning environment for students that will motivate them to stay committed to their education and reach their goals. While this new technology provides a bounty of benefits to many, assisting students in the achievement of their hopes and dreams holds the most value. ",

I also met some of my best friends that I still talk to today, they were super inviting and had a passion for the game and enjoyed it. I had never seen anyone enjoy a game that much. When thinking about it, it seems like a very funny and interesting story how you met your friends but when I talk to some kids they tell me that they met their best friends\u00a0of today by simply sharing the same interests and that is a great way to make friends. When going to a certain activity you go because you enjoy that one thing, well the other people there also enjoy that activity and now you know a whole bunch of people who share a common interest with you. sometimes even the smallest things can spark a friendship maybe you and someone play the same position on a sports team that can be a great reason to be friends or to even talk, doing extra curricular activities gets you out of your comfort zone and makes you feel just open and wanting to talk to people. When going to a certain activity thinking of how the people there are gonna act is a huge thing but most likely the environment is very welcoming and it makes you want to keep doing that one thing with the same people because of how they treated you. In conclusion making friends is a big deal and doing an extracurricular activity can play a huge role and help with making friends.  The more compliments you receive, the more people who say they like the idea. Many famous writers used other people's thoughts to see whether or not their book is good, and they ask for their opinion. An example from me is my favorite series of books:  Gone Series.  On the front cover of the book, it has one quote from an author, and on the back there were many other quotes from other companies. Adding to the quotes, on the top of the book said  #1 New York best Selling Book , basically saying to new readers that this series is good and popular. That is usually why on the front cover or back cover of a book contains a quote from different people or companies showing their good opinion about this book, so the readers can see that since this person liked the book, then it must be a good book to read. Having an award on your book also brings in popularity because winning something like the Pulitzer prize can bring a ton of attention to your book. It can give you more to believe in that your project will be good because you have many people who say your project is good. Not just the people who say that it's just \"good\", but also the people who point out the things that they especially liked within your idea, such as, \"I liked how you included this part to make that huge problem go away.\" These kinds of compliments makes you feel even better inside, and it tells you that you can take your mind off that one part of the idea and imagine more possible problems.  So in conclusion it is not a alien made face it simply in a mesa or a landmark on Mars. The proof is in the article when you see the 3 picutes that were taken to prove it wasn't a alien made artifact. No matter how cool it would be if it was not to mention that it could make NASA famous or rich it just doesn't have the proof you need to be a alien artifact. If you look more into the passage it even says it was not a alien made artiffact. Yes this face was very famous it even says \"The \"Face\" on Mars has since been a pop icon. It has starred in a Hollywood film, apperered in books, magazines, and even radio shows.\" (5). See how famous that face was 25 years ago is amazing but it still doesn't mean it was a alien made artiffact. So in final say it is not a alien made face and nor will there be enough proof its just a landmark on Mars that was very popular to people everywhere!            Just to show you what I mean, I'm going to get into more detail. Not to long ago my family, best friend, and I went out to go eat at Subway and when we got back into the car there was a man behind with all gold teeth, as soon as I saw him I didn't trust him because of his teeth and I started making a fist. Reasons like this is why I'm always trying to get advice from different people, I've seen how screwed up our world is right know and I've had trouble trusting people in public, what my parents always tell me is to welcome everyone. I know I should be following what they have told because I've done that my whole life, that's the reason I try my best not to cuss, I will sometimes say words like that, but I still try my best not to  Truthfully it is just another way to tell someone no to doing this or that or it is a continuation of limiting people on their creativity. Back in 6th grade most people had a problem with the art tecaher because she had such strict rules in a way it was either her way or the highway. No one could really understand why she had us doing things this way or that way. With that being said everyone was hoping that one day she would actually miss a day and one day she called out but then I looked around me everyone was having a fun time because they could express themselves through their art. All students need to be able to express themselves without having someone telling them that they are doing things wrong.  For example, there are almost 900 students in my school, This would mean in the 10 after school activities my school provides, there would need to be 90 kids in each one; That's enough to fill 4 classrooms. This brings up another problem, the school can't have 150 kids in one program and 10 in the other, so the school would have to chose the activity for us. Just that fact alone takes all the excitement out of the activity, just for reference, imagine the star quarter back on the football ending up in art instead, possibly destroying his or her whole football career. Most of my school's after school\u00a0activities need certain spaces for the participants to practice and do their activity. For instance the robotics team only has one room with all of the vices, saws, and tools while the other robotics rooms will have students constantly running between the other rooms getting tools that they dont have in their completely different room. The cheer leading\u00a0team will have to move to the gym to fit all the people, but so did the pep band, and basketball practice is already in the gym, but they could just go in the auxiliary gym which is smaller than the cafeteria, the problem with that is the wrestling team is already in the auxiliary gym. The school has no room to fit every team and all of the clubs.  Lets say you want to go on a cruise and you ask your friends and family their opinions about money wise, your friends most likely think its really cool, worth the money you can pay it off right. Your thinking, \"Yeah, this sounds like so much fun and its not that much I will work over time.\"  On the other hand your parents are thinking maybe its not so worth it your already in college\u00a0dept that you need to pay off why have another thing. So you think to your self, \"Maybe shes right this would be fun but I just really cant pay for it right now.\"  In the article, the author continously offers alternatives for exploration. He does this is paragraphs' 5,6, and 7 where he gives examples of organizations that are working towards this exploration. However in all of the paragraphs, the author seems to only be giving \"what if\" scenarios or in some cases just simple ideas that have been thought about and are possibly being examined. He fails to provide any real data or statistics for these things, except when he mentions the simplified electronics in paragraph 7. Even then, those devices are only able to survive for 3 weeks, so it would still take many years to just improve those devices. Also, in paragraph 6 the author states, \"Many researchers are working on innovations that would allow our machines to last long enough to contribute meaningfully to our knowledge of Venus\". This statement is very broad, and it does not key in on any form of information that should lead us to believe that to be true. These details from the passage prove my point on the amount of years it would take, as well as the fact that nobody has any idea how long. The question to be asked here is, \"Is it worth the wait?\". For these reaons I stand behind my claim that the author supported the idea of exploring venus very poorly.   The first person my sister asked for there opinion was our Grandma. After a while of my sister coming out in dresses the first thing I noticed was my Grandma always asking \"Well what do you think of it?\" before giving her opinion. I think this is a very good way to give your opinion without hurting any ones\u00a0feelings. You are asking how the feel about the dress before you put your thought in. But there are some disadvantages to that. Let's say she walks out of the dressing room in a dress my Grandma really doesn't like and she asked my sister how she feels about it and my sister says she loves it. Then you have a hard decision to make. Do you say you like it so you don't hurt her feelings or are you going to be honest and say you don't like it with the possibility of making her upset.  There is a saying that goes as this; \"You can't make everyone happy.\" One would typically use this saying if an action they make improves the situation for one person, but creates a worse situation for another. However, if Professor Thomas Huang's new 'Facial Action Coding System' proves to be what he says it can be, then Huang believes that there actually is a way to make everyone happy, even in the school setting.

                "content": "As you can see, their are many more cons then there are pros for cell phones allowed during class. Policy 2 is the right choice because it allows students to get in touch with whoever they need to contact, It can keep a student from cheating and save them the trouble that comes along with it, and it is also a way to slow down rumors, and a save a child's reputation. All just by removing cell phones from school.  As a current student in middle school, I have learned how children use cell phones. If you are reconsidering the cell phone policy, I believe the second one is the only way to go. Children in this school may sneak their cell phones into class without the teacher ever knowing if they are not banned. This will also lead to students doing poorly in class because they won't be paying attention to the teacher. Also, the use of cell phones in a wrong way can cause a student to get hurt. Overall, I believe your second policy to ban cell phones in class is the best choice because after being a student in school, I know what will happen if they are allowed in school.  Over all, I believe that banning phones from school is a bad idea. None of the students would follow the rule, and they would just bring them to school and hide them. This will get zero progress, and will create no change in the school environment. If you let students text during free time, it could keep students from texting during class, and help them focus more. By distracting the students while they are outside or have free time, it could prevent them from doing something to get them in trouble. And less people would be angry. You would not have angry students or parents coming up to the school to take back a confiscated item, thus not having to bother with any angry people. This is where I stand on the policies, but the final decision is up to you.  In my opinion, I believe Policy 1 is the better choice for our school. If cell phones are allowed to be used during free times and lunch, it would have a better effect on the students.  Overall, Policy 1 is a better policy because it still allows students to sometimes contact others with their cell phones. Today, cell phones are used by the majority of Americans multiple times. To take away their cell phones wouldn't be right. In some situations, students need them to call or text others to help them for whatever. Policy 1 works best because they have the chance to contact parents or friends when they need to, but they won't get distracted during class when they are turned off. This policy allows them to take care of anything they may need to, yet still be able to focus in class.  The students will find a way to bring there phones to school and use them while the teachers are not looking. Most of the students are already doing it, why you think putting a new policy is going to help the school it really is not, but by letting the students bring there phones in school and giving them time to use them is going to let the students know that the school trusts them, that the school doesn't think of them as children but as young and responsible adults  Many stories have been heard on the news about teenagers getting hurt from cell phone use. If students are allowed to use cell phones, who's to say they will always use them properly. Phones should be modified by parents so that their children are safe. The second policy is the only choice because it will prevent the dangers of phone use from happening.  If students do use their cell phones, they will not be paying attention to the teacher or what they need to know. Without the second policy, students' grades will drop lower and lower because they are not learning what they need to. This is just one more reason why the only way to go is to ban phones in schools at all times.  even to make sure of an after-school event, phones could be in great use. With Policy 2 in act, you could be staying in school for many hours until your ride picks you up.  You have listed two possible policies about cell phones at school. The issue is common among all schools, considering that children are texting in class. You have presented two very common ideas about cell phone usage; the first allows students to use their cell phones during lunch and other free times, while your second suggests banning students from having phones at school. While both ideas can be considered good, ",

                "content": "The author states, \"NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray.\". Stating ways that Venus can be studied with people not being put in danger helps get the authors point across. The article also touches on how floating above the surface could keep those studying the planet safe. Temperatures would still be high, but nothing the spacecraft couldn't handle, the air pressure would be like how it is on Earth at sea level, soloar power would be bountiful, and radiation would be no higher than the levels on Earth. The text then states, \"Not easy conditions, but survivable for humans.\". Although this would not be an easy job, it is possible to study Venus safely. The details used in this paragraph help convey the authors point that studying Venus can be done safely and that it should continue to happen.  From the example stated earlier, regaurding the extreme conditions in Venus, the author was able to provide a logical solution to the weather without using any opinions. The author wrote,\"NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow sceintists to float above the fray.\" The author then goes onto describe NASA's plan in full depth, and going into fine detail about the floating contraption that would suspend the astronauts safely above the harsh atmosphere of Venus. They then state, \"Not easy conditions, but survivable for humans.\" The author is displaying a solution for the conditions, and even the minor flaws it has. The author going into detail about the solution for the extreme conditions in Venus and even conceding a bit when saying, \"Not easy conditions but survivable for humans,\" helps argue their point. They affectively refuted the counter-arguements by using factual evidence in their rebutal, and deemed themselves trustworthy by the opposing side by even conceding slightly on a few issues.  When explaining NASA's ideas on sending humans to Venus, the author states, \"NASA\u0092s possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray.\" This provides evidence that shows what a solution is to avoiding some of the difficulties that occur when trying to explore Venus. The author was able to support his idea throught the use of NASA and it's research. The passage continues to come up with a plan on the best way to float above Venus when the author says, \"At thirty-plus miles above the surface, temperatures would still be toasty at around 170 degrees Fahrenheit, but the air pressure would be close to that of sea level on Earth.\" This factual evidence that is included ensures that the author is supporting this idea to the fullest of his potential. Researched and factual evidence that is provided all throughout the passage shows how the author supports this idea thoroughly and well.  The author says NASA has an idea on how to send humans to study Venus, \"...possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray\" (Paragraph 5). The ship would hover above, avoiding the dangerous conditions by remaining away from it. Allowing the scientists to be close enough to study some elements of Venus, and to have more context on how to understand it more, without a human possibly dying. To further support this, the author states, \"...hovering safely far above the planet can provide only limited insight...\" (Paragrah 6). The author is aware that hovering is not the most effectove technique, but he supports the idea by hinting it will still be worth it because information can still be gathered, despite the limits.  This, in turn, aids in convincing readers that might have originally disgareed with the author due to the fact that Venus' \"conditions are fare more extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth; such an environment would crush even a submarine assustomed to diving to the deepest parts of our oceans and would liquefy many metals,\" (3). The author, after making this counterclaim, refutes it by talking of some solutions to this ever-looming issue: \"NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions of the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray. Imagine a blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the roiling Venusian landscape,\" (5). The author talks of how the air pressure, temperature and radiation would all be survivable for humans. Some, such as the air pressure 30 miles above Venus, would be almost identical to Earth at sea level.  The author supports their claim by giving numerous details and supporting his ideas.\"Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endbeavors.\" A big issue that is brought up are the harsh conditions Venus brings. \"On the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Farenheight, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet.\" Knowing this, you might think that they must stop there with their research because there's no way they can discover Venus now because it's to dangerous and harsh. That is false, \"NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray.\" Their solution is to have a vehicle hovering over Venus that would avoid the unfriendly ground conditions by staying up and out of their way. It would still be toasty but not deathly. The author claims, \" Not easy conditions, but survivable for humans.\" The author supports his claim by saying yes, the temperature is a challenge they will face, but NASA has one particular compelling idea for sending humans to study Venus, and they will continue to challenge themselves and find solutions to these conflicts they face.  When discussing the exploration of Venus, most people are turned off by its reputation as a dangerous and challenging planet for humans to study. While the author doesn't stray away from these harsh extremities, they make sure to prove how these details seem insignificant and how safe travel can still be executed. The author thoroughly describes the plan provided by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) to allow astronauts to float above the fray and avoid the hazardous conditions. They provide specific qualities of the plan, such as the air pressure being close to the sea level on Earth, the abundance of solar power, and the containment of radiation, to prove how humans would be kept in a safe atmosphere. They even provide a real world connection between NASA's possible solution and a blimp-like vheicle hovering around the ground to make it easier for the audience to understand. The author combats the speculaiton of Venus being too dangerous to explore in order to further support the idea of it being a worthy pursuit.  This furthers the point more that NASA is also trying to send humans to go visit and study our planet's \"twin\". The author then goes on, proceeding to help our visualization of NASA's plan, telling the reader that NASA would not directly put humans on Venus's surface, but rather have them float in a blimp-like vehicle above the startpoint of Venus's weather and \"avoid the unfriendly ground conditions by staying up ad out of their way.\" The author lastly pointed out how, even with the toasty weather, Venus' surface is still survivable for humans, even though it's not full of easy conditions.  They are considering a blimp-like vehicle that would float above the suface of Venus to meet the challenges presented. This blimp would avoid the poor conditions of the Venusian landscape by floating some thirty miles above the surface. Conditions around the blimp would still be slightly hot, but the pressure and toxicity would be similar to that on Earth. These conditions are not ideal, but they would be sufficient enough to study Venus further. Another one of NASA's ideas is to use mechanical computers to study Venus. These mechanical computers do not require electronics, and they would be more resistant to the poor conditions of the surface. These new innovations in the study of Venus is what makes the dangers tolerable and the study worthy.  The author of this article supports the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers by stating the insight to be gained from further exploring Venus and by presenting new methods that are making new insights possible. The danger of Venus is extensive due to the high temperatures, extreme atmospheric pressure, and wild weather patterns. These obstacles are being dealt with though by new ideas from scientists at NASA. One big idea from NASA is the idea to use a blimp to observe Venus from above the surface. Another idea of theirs is to use materials that would be able to withstand the extreme conditions of the Venusian environment. All this is in the hopes that futher insight will be made on the planet that once was the most Earth-like planet in the solar system. ",

                "content": "the decision of the principal, while beneficial to the students, shouild be slightly changed so that students who already partcipate in an extracurricular activity outside of school will not be required to take one provided by the school. Extracurricular activities are beneficial to students because they improve performance in the classroom, help them pursue higher education, and improve their physical and mental health overall. Students should be given every opportunity to succeed, but requiring every student to participate in a school-based extracurricular activity would not be fair to the students who do so outside of school. They may experience certain drawbacks as a result of the tremendous workload forced upon them, and this may also lead to weakened mental health. For this reason, the principal's decision should be changed such that it only applies to students who do not partcipate in extracurricular activites of any kind.  I think the help of the elementary kids would be great for them, so they can get work done, and not just have to ask the teacher for help, but they can ask their tutor also.  For example, I'll pick, helping students in your classrooms. Then, I might start tutoring my cousins or neighbors, something to start of with, like a practice. If I'll see or think that I'm good enough, I might move on, tutoring Elementary kids. Later on, I'll be a famous tutor! If I'll be doing a good job at tutoring, I might starting subbing for teachers, then they'll ask me to be a teacher! Which means, that now I'll have a job! So basically, I made my own personal carrier just for helping the community!  However, the specific decision of the principal should be changed as students may already participate in extracurricular activities not provided by the school.  I think having every student be in a extracurricular activity is a great idea and i completely agree with the principal  I strongly disagree with the decision of my principal because forcing Generic_School students to participate in extracurricular activities wears them out and decreases the time that a Generic_School student has to finish assigned work. First of all, extracurricular activities melt a student's energy and can negatively impact a student's health and well-being. Second, extracurricular activities lead to students being distracted, ultimately depleting work and study time. Extracurricular activities were supposed to be a way to help students complete work, come to school happier, and get better grades. However, force-feeding extracurricular activities to Generic_School students will not produce the desired effect that my principal hopes it will, and that is a fact.  The principal has decided that every student must participate in at least one extracurricular activity. For example, a student could participate in sports, work in the yearbook committee, or serve on the student council. This decision should be slightly changed so that it only applies to the students who do not participate in an extracurricular activity of any kind.  If my principal ever decided to make students participate in an extracurricular activity, I would agree with their decision. Joining certain extracurricular activities can bring many benefits to students' lives and open up more opportunities for them in the future. Think about all the things you could learn through extracurricular activities.  Imagine you are an already busy highschooler focusing on maintaining your grades and your social life. All of the sudden, your principal decides that each student must participate in at least one extracurricular activity. Despite having a lot on your plate, you are now required to alter your weekly schedule in order to comply.  The principal should not force all students to participate in at least one extracurricular activity ",

And it's because of the winning candidate's share of popular votes. Everyone's President. It's stated that the Electoral College requires to a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal. The South and Northeast region don't have enough electoral votes to elect a president. So Romney had no incentive of campaining in the South. Swing states. The winner-take-all method is popular in each state in the U.S. Giving the winning candidate to win the presidency. The \"toss-up\" states are more likely to pay more attention to the campaign. 4 Big states. Larger states are more likey to have more electoral votes than smaller states. In contrast, Florida and Wyoming. Florida has 29 and Wyoming with only a mere 3 electoral votes. Avoid run-off elections. The electoral college avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast.  under the electoral college system, voters vote not for president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president. a dispute over the outcome of an elecoral college vote is possible, it happend in 200 but, its less likely than a dispute over the popular vote. The reason is that the winning candidate's share of the electoral college invariably exceeds his share of the popular vote. The electoral college requires a presidential candidate to have transregional appeal.  The first reason is Certainty of Outcome. This means \"it's less likley than a dispute over the popular vote.\" Which really means the candidates share to the other people in the Electoral college there share of the popular vote and thats how they vote. The second reason is Everyone's President. This is basically shows that \"the Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal.\" This means that no region such as south,northwest,etc. has enough electoral votes to elect a president. The third resone to keeping these methods is Swing States. This tells me that its the \"winner takes all method.\" The fourth method why we should keep these methods is the Big States. This explains that \"the Electoral College restores some of the wieght in the political balance.\" this means that the bigger states get a big advantage in the electoral because the people that get elected into office there is based off of population so they have an advantage. THe bigger states get more attention from the candates then the smaller states do. The final reason why we should keep this method of voting is Avoid Run-Off Elections. This means \"the Electoral College aviods the problem of Elections in which no candidates recieves a majority of the votes cast\". This means no pressure for candidates when they win majority of the votes cast.  In the first article \"What Is the Electoral College?\" by the Office of the Federal Register, the author asserts, \"Most states have a 'winner-take-all' system that awards all the electors to the winning presidential candidate.\" If a presidential candidate spends alot of time, effort, and money in a campaign for a \"swing\" state; he should be awarded all the votes for winning that state. It is a high risk but high reward to spend all that time and money to only earn sixty percent of the votes. That is why a \"winner-take-all\" is crucial. To add on, the author of the first article mentions, \"Each candidate running for President in your state has his or her own group of electors. The electors are generally chosen by the candidate's political party, but state laws vary on how the electors are selected and what their responsibilities are...\" This is saying that a candidate chooses his or her electors, and you vote for the electors to then choose the candidate you voted for  According to source one, \"What Is The Electoral College?\", each political party has it's own set of electors that equal the amount of congressional delegates per state. Usually each state has a \"winner-take-all\" method, so the presidential candidate that gets majority in your state will get all of the electors that represent their party, not just most of them. This is beneficicial to the outcome of the election becuase it makes the ability for a candiate to get majority vote much simpler. There is less of a possibility of a tie, or an outcome where no candidate wins. Source 3, \"In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep out despised method of choosing president\", states that \"even a very slight plurality in a state creates a landslide electoral-vote victory in that state...\" , therefore allowing the candidate to secure all votes to their side, instead of having the votes divided on the line of majority rule, and causing rifts between Electoral College voters.   My first reason of why we should abolish the electoral college is because of the method it is done in.  What I mean by this is, according to Source 1:What is the Electoral College?, it says, \"Most states have a  \"winner- take all\" system that awards electors to the winning presidential canididate.\" The winner- take all system is not a fair way to elect a president becuase of its biases.  In the 2012's election, obama received 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to only 51.3 percent of the popular votes. Obama won cause of the electoral college. Because almost all states award electoral votes on a winner-take-all basis, even a very slight plurality in a state creates a lanslide electoral-vote victory in that state. So one good reason is the certainty of outcome.  All in all the Electoral College is just the better method of voting. The Electoral College will give what the people want. Also the electoral college\u00a0 represents the states votes. The reason is because electoral colleges are game changers and a trust worthy method. Certainly it wll be easier to choose a president and break ties.     Citizens' wishes will not always be equivalent to what the electors vote for. This occurs partly because of the winner-take-all system. In this system, the winner of the popular vote in an individual state wins all of the electoral votes a state has. According to the Office of the Federal Register, all but two states use this system. These two states are Nebraska and Maine. As a result of the winner-take-all system, it is possible that a presidential candidate loses the overall popular vote, but wins more electoral votes and thus wins the election. This occurance happened in the infamous 2000 election, when Al Gore won the popular vote but lost to George W. Bush by a mere five electoral votes. If the public indicated they wanted Al Gore as president, why should Bush have won due to this unfair system? It simply doesn't make sense. The winner-take-all system also results in political campaigns to focus their efforts in only certain regions. Some states very predictably vote either for the Republican candidate or for the Democratic candidate. Take Texas, for instance, which has traditionally always voted red. A Democratic candidate knows he should not focus his campaign in Texas, because he realizes his best efforts won't allow him to win the popular vote there and thus win the electoral votes. Because of the tendencies of certain states, many electoral votes are practically predetermined. The states which do not typically only vote in favor of one side are labelled \"swing states\". With the way the Electoral College works, the few states which are a toss-up carry the most weight. Presidential candidates will usually spend most of their time in these swing states, and very little time in others. For example, in the 2000 election, seventeen states were not visited by either candidate. Supporters of the Electoral College view the disproportional focus of campaigns as a positive. According to Richard A. Posner's article in favor of this corrupt system, \"The Electoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment of the Senate decreed in the Constituion...\" (21)  In the article called What Is The Electoral College\", by the office of the Federeal register it quoted most states have a winner-take-all system that awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate. In the other article\u00a0 \"The indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong' ,by Bradford Plumer it quoted , candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the swing states. Electoral\u00a0 college is a unfair process because of the winner take it all. The winner takes it all system is a unfair process for the American citizens. even with a slightly change in the electoral college could change the tide or even cause a tie in the election.  ",

The author does not strongly support the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit due to his extensive reasearch on its toxic living conditions but does acknowledge the benefits of its accessibility from Earth.  Without being able to collect samples, the author weakens his argument to study Venus despite the dangers it presents.  The idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers is supported through Venus' vast similarites to Earth, which is why humans have such interest in this particular planet.  The author uses an idea proposed by NASA for humans to study Venus  and the innovation in machines by researchers that could make them work long enough to expand mankind's knowledge on Venus.  Venus, otherwise known as the \"Evening Star,\" is one of the more challenging planets to examine closely in our solar system. While this plant is often called Earth's twin, it is vastly different in terms of environment and hospitability. Despite being the closest planet to Earth at times, no spaceship has touched down on Venus in over thirty years. The dangers presented by Venus are many, but the author greatly supports the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite these dangers.

                "content": "To be more specific, if none of the advice given is liked, then new ideas begin to spark. For instance, someone is deciding whether to buy a big box of cookies or not and they ask two people for advice. One person says to buy it, and the other says not to. If neither idea sounds right, the idea to buy a smaller box surfaces which is both pieces of advice combined. If only one piece of advice was taken then, the decision could have been completely different and had a different consequence.  If someone were to ask one hundred different people what their favorite food is, they would probably get 100 different answers. This can be applied to advice because, if someone were to ask several different people for advice, they could get completely different advice from different people, and, chances are, some of the advice can really help instead of giving the person that needs advice useless information floating around. For a moment, imagine that it's time to vote for the President, and person 1 has no idea of who to vote for.  So person one goes back to his/her good friend person 2, then asks, \"Person two, who are you voting for?\" Person two replies with his/her chosen candidate, and person one asks several other people, and finally, person four tells person one about the candidate that he/she has chosen, and person one also votes for that person, because from what person four said, that person will do great things as President. If person one had just asked person two who to vote for, he/she never would've known that person four had chosen the candidate that was right for person one's beliefs. Another benefit to getting multiple people's solutions is that the different advice can be applied to the same problem until something works. For example, person one is trying to fix that pesky flat tire on his/her car, and then the advice that person two and person three gave. Because person one can't get person four to help, because person four is on vacation in Norway, person one decides to apply the advice of person two and person three to see if something works, and it turns out that person two had good advice once person one figured out what person two was trying to say. Basically, multiple answers can lead to the best answer and many solutions can be applied to the same problem until something works.  But big states, like California, Texas, and Florida have some of the most points, so if you were to win those, you already have more than one hundred points. Candidates would try to just seek out those jumbo prizes and systematicaly try to win the largest behind \"the Big Four\". If someone was reading this and wanted the Electoral College, they could say that the big states would still have an advantage with more voters, and that is right, but they wouldn't be as big of prizes. So the election turns from a voice of the people, speaking up for a new leader, and turns into a mad chase to get the biggest prizes before the other party, like a game of Monopoly. In Monopoly, you buy areas with your money, and when someone lands on that space you own, they have to pay you. The places ath the end of the board have the priciest cost, but the best outcome. You can also build property on spaces to make the enemy players pay more. If you were to buy those, you practically win the game. On the other hand, the spaces at the begining are basiclly worthless, costing about 100 dollars and giving you about 1000. Those are like the small states, that have almost no value to the election, and the big states are worth a lot.  By asking many people for advice on the situation, you encounter people that are wiser, smarter, and far more experienced than yourself.  For example, I remember encountering a situation as a fifth grader where I had to choose between saving my money or buying a new gaming system.  I had been saving this money since fourth grade, and I had accumulated more than four hundred dollars.  When I went over to my cousin's house, I was able to play on his gaming system, and I thought it was really fun.  Before I left, I made sure to ask him if I should invest in the same gaming system or to save the money.  His response was to buy the system.  Even though I got the advice I needed, I made sure to ask other people the same question.  Next, I remember asking my parents if it would be worth it.  My mom had told me that we already had lots of video games.  On the other hand, my dad told me that it was my money, and if this is what I decided to spend is on, it was completely fine.  After seeking multiple points of view, I had finally made my decision.  I was going to buy the gaming system.  To this day, I still play on that console, and I do not regret my investment.  After asking many people, you start to see a pattern in answers.  In my case, I figured out that the majority of people I asked said it was a good idea to buy the console,  If we go back to my story about whether or not to buy the console, the answer I received most was, \"Yes.\"  Ultimately, that was a big factor that told me I should buy the console.  If you ask many people the same question and you get the same answer, whatever they are telling you is probably the smart and correct thing to do.  It may not necessarily be the decision you were thinking of making, but it may be one to consider.  Back at the beginning of the school year, my English teacher assigned our class a project where we have to make a difference in our community.  At first, my idea was to organize a community-wide sports equipment drive.  When I got home that day, I discussed my idea with my parents, and they told me that was not the best idea, and that we should sit down and discuss a better idea.  I decided I wanted to prove them wrong.  Fast forward a couple of months, and I am struggling to get anything done on the project.  That night, I told my parents that my idea would not work, and they just gave me that \"I-told-you-so\" look.  From there, we devised a plan where I would instead help the volunteers on the Blue Ridge Parkway.  Right now, my project is going great, and I am close to crossing the finish line of completion.  From that, I learned that you need to take advice of others because, in my case, my parents knew what they were talking about.  If multiple people tell you that something is not the right choice, then you should probably reconsider.  That was a life lesson I needed to learn, but from seeking advice from more than one person, you learn many life lessons.   Another example is if you want to buy your best friend a gift for her birthday but you don't know what to get her. You decide to ask your friends to help you pick a present and they don't know what to get her either, so you decide to ask her boyfriend what you should get her and he tells you that she told him that she wanted to take a trip to the spa. Then you would know what to get your friend because you asked someone else who knew more about the situation.  You are walking through all the different houses. There are so many to pick, and you have to choose the right one for the right price. This house looks aesthetic, but this one's cheaper. This one has a bigger backyard, but this one is in a better community. There are too many ways where you could go wrong.\u00a0You end up calling up your friends to help you look through the options. You've all been there before, whether it was making decisions as big as buying the right house or as small as what restaurant to eat at.  Well not everyone you ask could have the right information, some could be telling false or just bad information. So getting other opinions could come in big for you if the first opinion was not very good. For example if you are trying to get a opinion on what you should buy a family member for a gift and you only get one opinion and they say that the person likes something but they really don't then that could be pretty bad for you. I don't think you would be to pleased either if that happened so just get a second opinion so everyone can be happy. Also sometimes the opinion could just be really bad and not help you at all. So do your self a favor and get multiple opinions.   Making a choice is not always an easy thing to do. Wether it's tyring to figure out what you should order on the menu, or a bigger decision like which college you should attend. However big or small the choice is, there are always people around you that can help you find the answer and give you their input on what you should do. Asking for the advice of people you trust can be really eye opening.  when you are seeking advice, it is much more beneficial for you to seek multiple people's opinions instead of just one person's opinion. It is more accurate, beneficial, reliable, and shows you what the majority of people think. It also gives you a definite answer, instead of just one person's thoughts. It also stops you from making a bias, or prejudice, decision. It shows you what the majority of people think, and lets you hear from everyone. From seeking advice on something as small as what shoes to wear, or as big as what house to buy, you should always seek multiple people's opinion instead of just one person's.\u00a0 ",

Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for the slate of electors, who in turn elect the president.  Who picks the electors? It depends on the state. Sometimes state conventions, sometimes the state party's central comittee, sometimes the presidentail canidates themselves. Voters can't controls whom their electors vote for. Well not always .Voters sometimes get very confused about the votes in vote for the wrong canidate.  The best arguement against the electoral college is called Disater Factor. The Americans should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election in a century. Back in 1960, segregations in Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratics with new electors that would oppose John F. Kennedy.  The Electoral College is widely regarded as an anachronism, a non-democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be overruled by declaring the canidates who recieve the most votes. A dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is possible, it happened in 2000, but it's less likely than a dispute over popular vote.  The Electoral College requires a presidential Canidate to have trans-regional appeal. No other region ( South, Northwest, etc.) has enough electoral votes to elect a president. The winner takes all method of awarding electoral votes. The electoral College avoids the problems of elections in which no canidate recieves a majority of the votes cast. For an example, nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992 both had only a 43 percent plurality of the popular votes.       \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ",

Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and the AFL-CIO all agreed on one thing, and it was aboloshing the Electoral College.

They all agreed on abolishing the electoral college  .

Why dosnt the goverment just give us what we want?  if 90% of votes go to a candidate, then why would they not get the presidency? its common sense.  According to my knowledge, the Electoral College isn't fair to voters. I know that many people such as, Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and the AFC-CIO agree with me on this. For instance, in the second passage on the first paragraph, it says that and much more. \"They're not alone [Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter...]; according to a Gallup poll in 2000, taken shortly after Al Gore - thanks to the quirks of the Electoral College - won the popular vote but lost the presidency, over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now.\" Suggesting by what this satement says, a lot of people disagree with our system of election  including ...\" Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole , the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and the AFL-CIO\" (Source 2). These are multiple people with proven track records and are some of many who are ready for change. The electoral college has brought good and bad to our country but there are times when things should be left in the past. ",

In 1960, segregationists in the lousiana legislature tried to get rid of the democratic electors. They wanted to replace them with people who would oppose John F Kennedy. Sourse 2, number 11 says \"In some vein, faithless electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for whoever they please...\" This means that with an Electoral college, the person you want to vote for may not even get picked cause of lying electors.  Richard Nixon, Jimmy carter, Bob Dole, and plenty of oothers think that it should change because according to a gallup poll in 2000 taken shortlyafer Al Gore he wonn the popular vote but lost the presidency dur to the quirks of the electoral college. in the Electoral College system people vote not for the prresident but for a slate of electors as i had said in the last pargrraph who in turn elect or the president. electors could be anyon not holding public office. voters sometimes control who there electors vote for. wich makes the voters sometimes get confsed about the electors wich makes them vote for the wrong candidate. In the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in the centery. in 1960 segegaters in Louisiana legslater nearly suceeddin replacing Democratic electora with new electors. So that the popular vote for Kennedy woulld not have actually gone to Kennedy. So them electors in the same vein they qould have to occasionally refuse to vote for the partys cannidate and cast a decideiing vote to who ever they please.  Direct voting would be a better way to vote so that everybody felt like their votes really counted towards who they voted for and that they arent getting cheated because one president has more electors supporting them. The electoral college is not based on equality because everybodys votes count differently due to supporters or electors who are pretty much the ones getting the votes. fixing the way people vote and how they vote can change the way some people feel towards the preident no matter who they are. Let the people vote for who they want and not the electors because it would make more people more open to vote than there are now.       In conclusion, I strongly feel that we need to change to an election by popular vote.\u00a0 Above all, it is more fair to the people.\u00a0 Citizens would feel that their votes matter more than they do now.\u00a0 People wouldn't have to be worried about if the electors would flip on what they had voted for.\u00a0 Although some say its is absolutely fair throughout all the states, there are still the set backs that come along with keeping an Electoral College.\u00a0 I agree with former presidents, Nixon and Carter, that we need to abolish the Electoral College.\u00a0 All of these reasons show you the problems there are with the current system of electing our President and I know you will agree  It isn't right to select a few people from each state to decide who the President will be. That power lies with the people, and nobody should be able to take that away. The votes of millions and millions of people are out-weighed by the votes of a few hundred men and women. This is unjust and unfair in every way. If all the people in the United States wanted somebody as President, but the Electoral College disagreed, the Electoral College would win. Why should the Electoral College have more power than all of the people of the United States; they shouldn't. The power to decide who is President of the United States of America should always lie with the good citizens that live here.   Sometimes voters could be discombabulated about who it is they are voting for. Sometimes voters can't control who the electors vote for. This is both confusing and frustrating for anyone who thinks they voted for someone great, but the electors change that. In \"Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong,\" it says that \"Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president.\", meaning that we don't choose for ourselves, they do.  The slate of electors is not picked by the people.\u00a0 It is said in, \"The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid jdefenses of the system are wrong\", that sometimes the state conventions, the party's central committee, or the presidential candidates themselves choose who will be their electors.\u00a0 That being said, you don't know whether or not the electors will follow your choice of president or not.\u00a0 For example, in 1960, some electors refused to vote for their party's candidate and they chose whomever they wanted. If we were to switch the way things are now, that would not happen.\u00a0 A poll taken in 2000 called the Gallup poll, showed that over 60% of voters prefered a direct election rather then the kind we have now.\u00a0 This took place when Al Gore recieved the popular vote, but lost the electoral votes.\u00a0 You can see that the current system has its flaws.   First, voters can walk into the booth and \"...get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate\" (Plumer 10). Not every voter is educated on exactly how the electors and candidates are represented on the ballot and that may lead to an accidental win. On top of this misconception, almost decietfully, an elector promised to a candidate can change their vote at a moments notice(Plumer 10). Even Posner who writes for the electoral college admitted that it is possible, and he claims that it is \"rare\";however, it has happened before in 1960 (Plumer 11), and not even Posner can control the actions of an elector, legally anyway. Also, when a candidate wins a popular vote, which is the true mind of the people, that candidate still may not win the electoral vote, overall, loosing the election. This happened just a few years back in the 2000 election between President Bush and Gore(Posner 16).All in all, the electoral college does not represnt the people.  So that means you actually don't get to vote for the president you want, the electors get to vote for the\u00a0 president they want and their choice might not be the same as yours. Here's an example that was in Source 1, \"If you lived in Texas, for instance, and wanted to vote for [John] Kerry, you'd vote for a slate of 34 Democratic electors pledged to Kerry.\" So you don't actually get to vote for a president. Also, in source 2, it states that the electoral college is unfair to voters because of how each state has the winner-take-all system, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance in winning, focusing only on the tight races in the \"swing\" states.  What Is the Electoral College?\" states you are voting for electors when you vote, but what is the point if they can simply defy you? It would be like if after the president was chosen, the Senate could overule him with a 1/5 vote. There is also the point in Plumer's article about the time Hawaii sent two slates, which forced the desicion to Nixon, who had to validate only the opponet's votes in fear of otherwise receiving bad publicity. There is also the strange way of resolving a tie, which boils down to the same thing as the winner-take-all system, except if more people support\u00a0 it doesn't matter. It would be like if everybody in the\u00a0 room wasn't alowed to vote, other than one voted, but everybody in the room agreed anyway for some strange, miraculous reason. (Of course, the one guy in the\u00a0 next room doesn't agree, and completely takes out your vote, regardless of the fact that there were 30 people in this one.) ",

So i believe that it was not created by aliens but that it was just something the olanet had made itself. This has certainly got the attention of the people.  The \"Face on Mars\" is not a face. If you look at the pictures from 1976, and 1998, and 2001 and in the text it says that the photo from 2001 is the most recent photo that NASA has. It still looks nothing like a face so since the 2001 picture is the most recent it shows that it is just a natural landform. It is just a natural landform. On Mars there are natural landforms everywhere and the fade away. Here on earth natural landforms are created everyday.  It does look like it could be from another living organism, but it's just a rock on the planet. In our newest image of the rock, it turns out that the face has dissapered. There is no evidence of this being created by aliens, rather it was created by wind and water that has been found on Mars. The reason you might believe that this was indeed aliens, might be the fact that the news has blown it out of poportion. It's just the rock that had some interesting shadows and holes that made it look like a human face.  In conclusion, NASA is either brave or very stupid not to tell people about their \"face\", or people just want to get their word out to make other people critisized, make other people feel stupid, or they just want to feel like they are correct when they are clearly not. Therefore; This \"so called face\" is not a face, but it is just a land mark that was naturally constructed by the elements and not alien life-forms.  The \"face\" isn't any perticular shape that any man or alien would want. The landform would be shaped as a circle, square or any other simple shape, and it would not be so ridgid and cracked. If you were to look at the photo furthest to the left, you would assume that it resembled a face, but If you compair that photo to the one taken twenty-five years later, you would begin to understand that to photo was out-dated and that the camera was not as clear as the one taken later. In addition, why would an alien make a structure of a human's face.   Even thoug hmy colleague still believes in the \"Face on Mars\" to be a alien made structure. I still believe it's only a butte or mesa. With my evindence of the \"Face on Mars\" only looking like a face due to the techonology of the time, the shadows of the sun, the angle the picture was taken, and our ability to see faces when none are there, I believe I have conclusive evidence that the \"Face on Mars is nothing but a butte or mesa.  Mars has been a planet that we have been exploring for many years. We have discovered many abnormal objects on the planet. In 1976, we took a picture of the region Cydonia, and we found something that seemed to look like a human face. Our eyes are adapted to recognizing faces and that is why we recognized the face on Mars more easily. Higher quality images that were taken in 2001 show that the face on Mars is no sign of ancient civilization on Mars but in fact a mesa.  In conclusion, the face is just a natural landform. It may look like a head, but that is just because of the unusual shadows that the mesa has. If my co-workers and I thought this was actually proof of alien life, why would we hide it from you? What is the point in hiding that kind of information?  In 1988 a Viking 1 took a, slightly disturbing, picture. Of a face! Viking 1 found a landform that happends to look like an Egyptian Pharoah. This face was found and started major controversy.  Some people had thought that it was fake and others thought that it was just a coincidence. The massive sand storms just created a face. That's all that they thought. But can that be true?   In 1976 NASA released a photo of a landform on Mars resembling a human face. Not everyone was easily convinced that it was only just a landmass though. Conspiracy theorists believed that it was, \"Bona fide evidence of life on Mars.\" In the article \"Unmasking the Face on Mars,\" the author, Garvin, believed that it was only a mesa.  the only reason the natural landform even remotely looked like a face was because of shadows.

                "content": "I think that you should think of allowing students to bring phones to school and let them use them during lunch periods and other free times, as long as the phones are turned off during class time.  As a current student in middle school, I have learned how children use cell phones. If you are reconsidering the cell phone policy, I believe the second one is the only way to go. Children in this school may sneak their cell phones into class without the teacher ever knowing if they are not banned. This will also lead to students doing poorly in class because they won't be paying attention to the teacher. Also, the use of cell phones in a wrong way can cause a student to get hurt. Overall, I believe your second policy to ban cell phones in class is the best choice because after being a student in school, I know what will happen if they are allowed in school.  The students will find a way to bring there phones to school and use them while the teachers are not looking. Most of the students are already doing it, why you think putting a new policy is going to help the school it really is not, but by letting the students bring there phones in school and giving them time to use them is going to let the students know that the school trusts them, that the school doesn't think of them as children but as young and responsible adults  Student should be allowed to keep there phones on their person as long as they are turned off at all times during a regular school day. this then creates the problem of students texting during school hours and class so I propose that students who are caught texting or using the cell phone during school our not in the case of an emergency should have there phones took away for a set amount of time. much like if a student does something wrong he/she is punished with a certain amount of time.  Eight out of ten schools who allowed students to have their phone out at a specific time of day saw a decrease in the number of phones out during class time. Giving students this time will show that you trust them to do what they are supposed to in class. Plus, students may realize administrators trust them to keep their phones off and in their pockets during class.  Over all, I believe that banning phones from school is a bad idea. None of the students would follow the rule, and they would just bring them to school and hide them. This will get zero progress, and will create no change in the school environment. If you let students text during free time, it could keep students from texting during class, and help them focus more. By distracting the students while they are outside or have free time, it could prevent them from doing something to get them in trouble. And less people would be angry. You would not have angry students or parents coming up to the school to take back a confiscated item, thus not having to bother with any angry people. This is where I stand on the policies, but the final decision is up to you.  You have listed two possible policies about cell phones at school. The issue is common among all schools, considering that children are texting in class. You have presented two very common ideas about cell phone usage; the first allows students to use their cell phones during lunch and other free times, while your second suggests banning students from having phones at school. While both ideas can be considered good,  To keep kids focus they shouldn't bring there phones to school or if they do bring there phones to school then give it to the office or your teacher to hold on to it until school its over.  In my opinion, I strongly believe that cell phones should be turned off and put into people lockers during the school day other than allowing students to have their phones at lunchtime.  Imagine you were a kid at school, and you forgot it was a shortened day. You need to call your parents but, no, you can't because your principal decided to ban cell phones all together. Now what? ",

For example, my close friend, Generic_Name, just graduated from CalTech with his Bachelors and Masters Degree in cyber security and software development. He's thinking of applying to Microsoft to be an engineering coordinator, but he's unsure if he will be accepted. He knows that hundreds of thousands of candidates apply each year, but only a small number of people are accepted. Generic_Name decides to ask for advice from one of his friends, Generic_Name, who currently works at Microsoft. Generic_Name told him that with his work ethic, he would surely get fired during his first week of the job. Generic_Name wasn't sure if this was constructive criticism, or if Generic_Name was jealous of him and wanted to see him fail. Generic_Name thought about it, and decided to ask his college professor, Mr. Generic_Name, what he thinks he should do. He told him that he would thrive working at Microsoft and he would regret it if he didn't apply. After much consideration, he decided to apply. Five months later, he received his acceptance letter in the mail and happily took the job. He is now well known throughout the country. If someone is given the chance to do something great, they shouldn't turn it down.  If you are talking to family member they may not care about your problems or say something along the lines of \"oh honey it's ok you will be fine\" and them saying that is not fine and you should never be satisfied with that answer from anyone. Your friend or close peer, like a teacher or coach will want to understand your issue and they want to help you at all costs because they know that your a good kid and they never want to see you down,moody or upset ever. Your coaches put you through struggle and so do you teachers so they know you can handle the hard moments in life and want to always help you, so you can make the right decision. whenever you hear a question in class you want to seek understanding about the question so you can answer it the next time someone asks. The issue hear is very similar to that and when you have a problem or issue that you believe needs a second opinion they will always be willing to listen. That way they can ultimately impact your decision for the better and you will be so relieved and you will ask yourself why you didn't go to them earlier   There is pleanty of things wrong in this world, but one thing that is pretty good right now is the Electoral College. More times than not it has one winner and one loser, and rarely a tie. It makes sure that nobody is a favorite or feels like it. Also it shows things can change if something is a problem or needs fixing. The Electoral College is not perfect, but is not broken. Thank you for reading my letter, I hope you take it into concideration when deciding to keep it or not.   My phone buzzed with his name appearing at the top. God, I don't wanna talk to you right now, take a hint man. My boyfriend and I had just had a huge fight and I'm texting my friend Generic_Name for advice. After explaining her opinion she says to listen to other peoples advice then decide what to do.  When faced with an issue normally our first reaction is to try to solve it on our own, although most of the time our head is way up in the clouds and we need another person to drag us back to the reality of the issue. Although most times, you need a few more than just that one person to help you make the correct choice.  I believe we should abolish it completely. I believe that we should change our voting system to election by popular vote for the president of the United Sates.  like the whole nixon thing,and Kennedy pretty much cheated on his wife with Marlyn Monroe. but,this can be stopped just with a simple petition to get rid of or change the electoral college. then,this could stop some presidents before agreed with me like Jimmy Carter,Bob Dole, and groups like the U.S Chamber of Commerce and the AFL-CIO according to source 2. Al Gore didn't win because of the electoral college,even though he won the popular vote!  Lets say you want to go on a cruise and you ask your friends and family their opinions about money wise, your friends most likely think its really cool, worth the money you can pay it off right. Your thinking, \"Yeah, this sounds like so much fun and its not that much I will work over time.\"  On the other hand your parents are thinking maybe its not so worth it your already in college\u00a0dept that you need to pay off why have another thing. So you think to your self, \"Maybe shes right this would be fun but I just really cant pay for it right now.\"  beacuse it will encourage more people to vote  He goes to vote. His vote is passed along, checked off, and placed aside for a time. When all of the votes are in, the republican votes outweigh the democrats. Now, our democrat's vote, his wife's vote, the democratic guy who works at 7-11 down the street's vote, Joe's vote, Bob's vote, Billy's vote, \"That girl Suzie's\" vote and ALL THE DEMOCRATIC VOTES IN THE STATE are all, essentially, thrown into the furnace, and will do so next election, the election after, and essentially every mostly republican election after that. In a popular vote without the barrier of the Electoral College, all those votes would flow into the pile for whichever canidate they voted for. Then the pile would be counted, divided into the total votes, and percentaged. then, at lest the votes could count for SOMETHING, other than a waste of time.  I whole-heartedly believe if we leave the responability to chose our president in the magority vote that this country will become more unstable than it already it ",

                "content": "When the Constitution of the United States was written our founding fathers decided on an Electoral College as the way to ellect the president instead of a direct vote. The Electoral College is a process that makes a compromise between the popular vote of the citizens and the Congressional vote. When citizens vote for president they are actually voting for a member of the Electoral College that is going to select their president, rather than the citizens voting for the president themselves. The Electoral College is made of 538 electors, the number of electors from each state varies depending on the states Congressional delegation. Washington D.C. is counted as a state for this process and alloted only three electors.  The number of electors per state under the Electoral College is determined by the number of representatives the state has in congress. \"... one for each member in the House of Representatives plus two for your senators...\" (Office of the Federal Register 3). Since this system is based on population, bigger states get a emense priority over smaller states. \"The popular vote was very close in Florida [in 2012]; nevertheless Obama, who won that vote , got 29 electoral votes. A victory by the same margin in Wyoming would net the winner only 3 electoral votes.\" (Posner 21). This means that presidential candidates are going to focus on appealing to larger swing states that have more electoral votes, rather than smaller ones who only provide a few votes. That is not fair now is it? No matter how small a state may be its population still consists of United States' citizens, and they deserve just as much say as a bigger state. After all, that is the concept our country was founded on, equality and freedom.  What is electoral college? The electoral college is a process, not a place. the founding fathers established it in the constitution as a compromise between election of the president by a vote in congress and election of the president by a popular vote of qualified citizens. But it is also a bad thing because you help choose your states electors when you vote for president because when you vote for president because when you vote for your canadate you are actually voting for your canadates electors.  The electoral college imposes on the American freedom and right to choose their president. The United States of America is a representative democracy. The citizens choose who they want to lead but those votes aren't truly their own votes. According to Richard A. Posner of source 3, \"...the Electoral College method is not democratic in a modern sense...it is the electors who elect the president, not the people. When you vote for a presidental candidate, you're actually voting for a slate of electors.\" American citizen votes do not matter as much as we think they should. The founding fathers built this country for the people. The people should have an actual voice in who they want to lead this great nation. In addition, Americans should have a direct say. Votes should go straight to the president and not the party's electors. This is not only fair to citizens but also a more relible plan. Bradford Plumer of source 2 explains to us that \"\"faithless\" electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please...\" We can't depend on these electors to determine one of the most important things of this country. We can't depend on these \"faithless\" electors to vote who we want when they might do the opposite. Voting by popular vote prevents these mishaps and restores our democracy.  In \"Source 3: In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President\", author Richard A. Posner explains that the Electoral College \"restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment of the Senate decreed in the Constitution.\" The Electoral College gives larger states more attention from presidential candidates as opposed to a smaller state. Posner continues the idea with \"the most thoughtful voters should be the ones to decide the election.\" To break it down, voters who pay close attention to the campaign will be the most thoughtful voters and they will recieve the most attention from the candidates. This reduces the amount of disputes because the presidential candidates will decide on who to give the most attention to.  The Electoral College was established in the Constitution by the founding fathers. \"The Electoral College process consists of the selection of electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for president and Vice President, and the counting of the electoral votes by Congress\" is stated in source 1. This is process has been around for decades, but things have changed.  \"The Electoral College is a process, not a place. The founding fathers established it in the Constitution as a compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens\"(Office of the Federal Register1). Thus, the Electoral College is a balance of votes that includes many different sources for which the President is elected  Most people dont really understand what the Electoral College is, or what it is about, so let me just inform you about it a little. The Electoral College is a process that was established in the constitution and it is a strategy that we use to elect out presidents. The citizens vote for the president, but so the the electors in the Electoral College. There are over five hundred members of the Electoral College, and if a canadate wants to win presidency, he/she has to gain 270 of the Electoral College's votes. Each person running has a set of their own electors  in sourse one it states that the \"Electoral college was established in the Constitution as a compromise between election of the president by a vote in congress and  election of the president by a popular vote of qualified citizens   The Electoral College is a system that allots a certain amount of electoral votes to each state. Each state is given 2 electoral votes plus another amount of votes which depends on that state's population. The amount of votes ranges from 3 to 55 (source 3). A candidate must recieve 270 out of 538 possible votes. The candidate the electoral votes of a state go to is decided by the majority vote of each individual state. In all states but Maine and Nebraska give a candidate the entirety of their votes if the majority of its citizen votes for them (source 1) ",

However, if one wishes to use this strategy, they must also make sure that they are asking people who have experience and past knowledge in the decision to be made. A high-schooler who is deciding between two colleges and wishes to ask others on the college he should attend should not ask random strangers walking down the street. Instead, he should ask other gifted students, prestigious educators, or other intelligent adults who might know how to make a better decision than the student himself. However, even after receiving plentiful advice from others, one should know that you are still the person who should take all facts into consideration, and then make the final decision based on your thoughts and ideas.  making a choice is difficult than it already is, and making the best choice does not seem like it is any more luxurious. Some people might be able to decisions\u00a0at the speed of light without getting any opinions, while others might need some more opinions in order to make their decision. Life is all about making choices everyday and people have to accept the results that come out of it. Some people might be more carefree about it, while others might need to think more before they make a choice. Wanting to make the best choice is not selfish at all and is just a part of life. Wanting the credibility, different ideas and views from people is just another way of making the best choice. Therefore, seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice because of credibility, people have different ideas, and people have different views.  They are in the comforts of their home and have the freedom to attain food or use the bathroom at any given time. Video conferences can be held once a week and may not even reveal a student's appearance, so students can wear whatever clothing they desire or feel most comfortable in. Students are not in the high stress school environment and can feel more relaxed. This may lead to an increase in productivity and focus on one's schoolwork.  Instead, someone should always seeking multiple opinions to help with choosing what to do because it can insure that they make the best choice. When a person makes a right decision, this does not only give them a decision that they will not regret, but it will also save them from wasting time and money. Choosing the right thing to do now can also help them in the future when making decisions related to their past scenario. The decision someone makes might seem small on the outside, but truly when a good choice is made, this can change a persons life for the best. That is why making a right choice is important, and a person can only make the best decision when they have talked with more than one person.\u00a0   \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  The U.S government lets people choose these electors so they feel important in the choices our country makes. We take time to study our favorite candidates, and if the electoral college does not agree with them, they are pushed to the side. What happens to the people who did not vote for the, \"right\" candidate? They are forever unheard. Sentenced to live in a community where they are silcenced. I do not agree with the electoral college because agree with our fore father Abraham Lincoln. He said this was supposed to be a country of the people, by the people, and for the people.   It is crucial to consult more than one person for their opinion or advice about something when you are looking for the best choice you could possibly make. By asking them for their advice or opinion you will get a different perspective on your choice, you will also receive tons of ideas and information to help make a good decision. Having more people consult on a decision helps the person making the final decision narrow down and decide what choice they should make. Like people say \"Two minds are better than one!\".   Asking multiple people for advice allows for better made choices because they will have most of the information needed to make a decision, and asking multiple people will result in a higher probability to find someone that is unbiased.\u00a0When trying to get the best choice for a solution asking multiple people can allow for your decision\u00a0to be unbiased, informed, and the overall most common choice.\u00a0Remember, the best choice can always be backed up by others.  When come across a difficult decision that you may not have experienced and went through before, there is a high probability that there are other people who have been in the same place. These people will be able to offer their own experience in this decision, the decision they eventually made, and the conclusion they had arrived to. For example, a toddler choosing between ice cream could ask others what ice cream flavor they prefer, and choose the ice cream the majority of people seemed to like. Meanwhile, a teenager deciding on a college could ask adults who have recently graduated from the schools he is choosing between, and question them\u00a0about their own first-hand experiences in that college.  We all want to make the right choice when we come across a problem. The only way to do this is to ask multiple people for advice. Asking more than one individual helps us know the options, stay away from bias, and learn from others' past experiences. Once we do this, it is our turn to choose what is the best choice.\u00a0  Its give's you more option's, people who have already been their can be the most helpful, and overall having a second opinion can be more helpful than you know. And having more option's than you need can help you weather it's a big decision or a little one. And having more can help you pick out the one's you dont need and help you find the one's you do need. And you may find out that what someone said really helped you and you may go back to the for more advice and it's just a never ending loop to help you everyday.\u00a0 \u00a0 ",

Well, the computer can read their expression and accomodate to the needs of the learner. Likewise, the student could be ahead of what is being taught, academically, which could be read by the facial decoder and adjusted in their lessons  Computers don't have emotions, but you do! Imagine technology that seriously works for you, not only at home but also in the classroom! If technology could accurately read human facial expressions the learning possibilities could be endless. For example, think about that one story that you're forced to read that you just can't understand and brings out all your frustrations, with facial expression recognition you probably will never be so frustated again.  The human body has way more than just six emotions so getting a high accuracy reading on how you are really feeling is out of the question because FACS uses the a process of a 3-D model Dr. Huang states \"The process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D model of the face; all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles.\" This quote explains that it has to use a way of making a model which can sometimes take some time depending on the processing power of the computer not only that but human emotions can change quite quickly and if the pc doesnt make the model fast enough the computer can easly fail at getting and accuarate reading.  The people using this technology are doing so many things, \"The process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face;\" So they're not only using 3-D software but also, \"Using video imagery, the new emotion-recongnition software tracks these facial movements.\" The people who are specializing in doing this kind of technology, are branching out in very large, and impactful ways. Many students could be interested in doing this, and sometimes if it's not in school and they don't hear of it. They can never find it.  So now what do you think? Computers advance more and more everyday, however facial recognition may just be the beginning. Learning in classroom has become based on all technology in many different forms. Facial tachnology will broaden our horizons with better test scores and happier students that can understand the material evn better than before! The use of technology to read the emotional expressions of the students in a classroom could be a life changing improvement in the 21st century since every student has different wants and needs as far their education.  The Facial Action Coding System enables computers to identify human emotions. This new software has a promising applications for a variety of industries. \"Can we actually calculate emotions, like math homework?\" \"How can a computer recognize the subtle facial movements we humans use to express how we feel?\"  Slip into a world where emotions are easily read. There could be no mind games, no pettiness, and no suffering in silence;this could be the new reality. In the article \"Making Mona Lisa Smile\" by Nick D'Alto, he introduces a new concept created by Thomas Haung:Facial Action Coding System software. This programming system allows computers to register all of the emotions on an individual's face, reguardless if they are mixed.  Dr. Huang is talking about the device using video images to pick up the emotions of each person. Dr. H states \"using video imagery, The new emotion recognition software tracks these facial movments in a real face or on a painted face.\" This quote brings to light that the machine can read emotions but one could say since it is still in new development that not all of the bugs or glitches have been worked out not only that but you also have to devote more resources to keep the machine working which can average to be a heafty hit to your wallet.  For example,\" a classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,\" Dr. huang predicts. \" Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instrucuture.\" This is really helpful to some students because when taking an online lesson some of them might be comfused and the teacher is no there to help. So the computer can take these facial expresions and modify the lesson so you could undestand it better. This also follows along if a student needs help with the lesson, the computer could see you are having a hard time and t to help you by changing the lesson  According to the article \"Making Mona Lisa Smile,\" there is a new technology called the Facial Action Coding System (FACS) that enables computers to identify human emotions. This technology is relatively brand new. It creates a 3-D computer model of all fourty-four major muscles in the face that move like human muscles as well. Then, psychologists have classified six basic emotions that are associated with different movements in the facial mucles. This new technology could result in many benefits in our community as well as all around the world ",

        "query": "The founding fathers established it in the Constitution as acompromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by popular vote of quilified citizens. Your state's entitled allotment of electors equals the number of members in its Congressional delegation, one for each member in the House of Representatives plus\u00a0 two for your Senators. The presidential election is held every four years on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. You help choose your state's electors when you vote for your candidate you are actually voting for your candidate's electors. The Certificate of Ascertainment also declares the winning presidential candidate in your state and shows which electors will represent your state at the meeting of the electors in December of the election year. Your state's Certificates of Ascertainments are sent to the Congress and the National Archives as part of the official records of the presidential election. At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winner-take-all system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states the know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on thje tight\u00a0 races in the  swing  sates. During the 2000 camaign, seventeen states din't see the candidates at all, inckuding Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters inn 25 of the largest media markets didn't get to see a single campaign ad. If anyone has a good argument for putting the fate of the presidency in the hands of a few swing voters in Ohio, they have yet to make it. The electoral College requires a presindential candidates to have trans-regional appeal. No region (South, Northeast, etc.) has enough electoral votes to elect a president. So a solid regional favorite, such as Rommey was in the South, has no incentive to campaing heavily in those states, for he gains no electoral votes by increasing his plurality in states that he knows he will win. This is a desirable result because a candidate with only regional appeal is unlikely to be a succesful president. The residents of the other regions are likely to feel disenfranchised, to feel that their votes do not count, that the new president will have no regard for their interests, that he really isn't their president.

These people want a good president and it happened in 2012. Alot of Southern states like Mitt Romney and they voted for him. He got alot of votes and was beating Obama. But Obama got\"61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to only 51.3 percentpf the votes for Romney.\" Romney had change in his eyes and the Electoral College didnt care and took that away from him.  \"The founding fathers established it in the Constitution as a compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote.\" (the Office of the Federal Register). People must remember that this system is a compromise for the election and that any change could lead to problems among the government again. The public must also remember that \"each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee\".(Richard A. Posner). This system also can often prevent disputes. \"A dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is possible...but it's less likely than a dispute over the popular vote. The reason is that the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College invariably exceeds his share or the popular vote.\" (Richard A. Posner). Along with the fewer disputes, it also creates standards for the candidate. \" The Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal...This is a desirable result because a candidate with only regional appeal is unlikely to be a successful president.\" (Richard A. Posner). Another benefit to this system is that it causes voters to pay closer attention to the election. \"Voter in toss-up states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign.\" (Richard A. Posner). Along with the more aware voters, the Electoral College is also very beneficial to the big states. \"The Electoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states (by population) lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment of the Senate decreed in the Constitution.\" (Richard A. Posner). And lastly, the Electoral Collee helps avoid run-off elections. \"There is pressure for run-off elections when no candidate wins a majority of the votes cast; that pressure, which would greatly complicate the presidential election process, is reduced by the Electoral College, which invariably produces a clear winner.\" (Richard A. Posner). To sum it all up, there are many benefits to the Electoral College.  The general population, though average citizens, are somtimes not as qualified as Congress to make unbiased, beneficial decisions on behalf of the rest of the country. However, knowing that the next President could be a part of Congress, sometimes sways the decision in favor of a particular candidate. In this paradox of the qualification of Congress and the average citizen, the electoral college is used to fill the void. The electoral college has been used since the founding of the country. The founding fathers of America (George Washington, Ben Franklin, John Adams, Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, etc.)must have developed the electoral college process for some reason. According to the Office of the Federal Register, \"The founding fathers established it in the Constitution as a compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens.\" More than anything the electoral college is a mutual and nuetral process that represents something inbetween the biased politics of Congress and the average citizen. The average working class person is the greatest example of American integrity. This person shows that in this great nation, if you set a goal and are willing to work to acheive that goal, it can be acheived.  The world we live in now compared to the 1800s is very different. We've upgraded, not only in our inventions, but our states as well. The electoral college was made when America was first established because it was fit for the needs of that time. The Office of Federal Register states, \"The founding fathers established it in the Constitution as a compromise between the election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens.\" Back then, it was needed to balance things out among the 13 colonies. In those times, we didn't have the advance techonology we have now to see our candidates on screens or in person. Since then, we've turned 13 colonies into 50 states, turned horses into cars, and small radios into televisions. Rules and laws change to fit the current needs all the time. The electoral college should do the same. Due to the fact this system has been around since the founding fathers, major mistakes occur  The Electoral College is a process not a place. When the founding fathers established it in the Constitution as a compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and also a popular vote of approved citizens.  Do you know what the Electoral College is? It's a process that the founding fathers established in the Constitution as a compromise between election of President by a vote in Congress and election of President by popular vote of qualified citizens.  I think that they should keep the electoral collage because the founding fathers established it in the Constitution as a compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens.  A while back the founding fathers established it in the constitution as a compromise between election of the president by a vote in congress and election of the president by a popular vote of quallified citizens.  When the Constitution of the United States was written our founding fathers decided on an Electoral College as the way to ellect the president instead of a direct vote. The Electoral College is a process that makes a compromise between the popular vote of the citizens and the Congressional vote. When citizens vote for president they are actually voting for a member of the Electoral College that is going to select their president, rather than the citizens voting for the president themselves. The Electoral College is made of 538 electors, the number of electors from each state varies depending on the states Congressional delegation. Washington D.C. is counted as a state for this process and alloted only three electors.  The president of the united states is one of the most powerful political leaders in the world and controls the faith of one of the wealthiest countrys on the planet. There have been many discussions on how to elect the president of such a great nation. The Electoral College,\u00a0 the founding fathers established it in the constitution as a compromise between election of the president by a popular vote of qualified citizens. If its worked for over 200 years why change it. ",

                "content": "While providing simple, yet interesting facts about Venus, such as it being the planet closest to Earth's density and size, may be enough to intrigue the audience into wanting to learn more about the planet, the author takes it a step further. The author goes in depth about the possibility of Venus being the most Earth-like planet in our solar system long ago. They detail the planet's environment today, consisting of Earth-like structures such as rocky sediment surfaces, valleys, mountans, craters, and other geological findings. They also state \"Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth.\" This information opens up an entirely new realm of possibilites for the audience to consider, and is more likely to interest them as it directly relates to our life on Earth. The way the author has set up the comparisons of Earth and Venus have allowed the audience to view the exploration of the planet as an opportunity to see a planet that could be like us; a planet with living, breathing forms of life similar to what we see everyday. The author uses this information to encourage the audience to view the pursuit of Venus as a chance to gain information on the things we see in our everyday life, and not just complex ideas that are difficult to understand and most-likely won't affect them.  Paragraph 4 states, \"Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system. Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth\" (The Challenge of Exploring Venus). If Venus could've supported human life long ago, it is likely the planet still can. The scientific facts throughout this statement support the author's claim by having a reliable source of information, supporting the idea. Paragraph 4 reads, \"Today, Venus still has some features that are analogous to those on Earth. The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters\" (The Challenge of Exploring Venus). Venus already has Earth-like landscapes and other similar formations. This supports the author's idea of exploring Venus because it is so similar to Earth, the chances of survival are higher than any other planet.  The first paragraph introduces the topic of Venus with an interesting hook, but does not give the reader their side. The reader needs a thesis, without one the reader is not going to be able to have their opinion on a topic swayed. The author's current attempt at a thesis statement , \"While Venus is simple to see from the distant but safe vantage point of Earth, it has proved very challenging place to examine more closely,\" does not state what side they are on clearly. Their best declaration of the side they are on is in their very last paragraph. The author wrote, \"Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation.\" This is a very strongly worded thesis, but would have been much better if placed in the starting paragraph. Their side on the topic was acknowledged, but not as well as it could have been if they had set up their thesis correctly.  Venus used to be covered in oceans and supported life. Additionally, Venus still has features that are similar to Earth's such as a rocky sediment with valleys, mountains, and craters. Insight into the Venusian landscape would further allow astronomers to determine how closely related Earth and Venus were. The author also states that humans should not be limited by their fear to go out and explore. In the final paragraph of the article, the author describes how human curiosity will lead humans into many intimidating expidentures. However, the author believes that travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited simply due to danger, and humans should travel as far as their innovation will take them.  Venus has a rocky surface similar to that of Earth's. It also has valleys, mountain, and craters all of this is similar to that of Earth's and can be used to maybe help us more understand out planet. Another thing that the author brings up is that Venus is similar to Earth is that scientist believe that Venus was once covered largely with oceans. This means that their could have been life on Venus such as plants.  The author is aware of the fact and describes how, \"no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours\" (paragraph 2). Right off the bat, the author gives their audience the mindset that it is not a good idea to study Venus. Having that fact in the first few paragraphs of the article sets the tone for the rest of the article. In paragraph three, the author goes into great detail about several of the potential dangers that can come from studying Venus because of its, \"clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid\" (paragraph 3). The frightening environment described strays the audience even further away from believing that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers  In Paragraph 4, the author states, \"Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system.\" If this is true, then could Venus become like Earth once again?  That suggests that we already know some facts about Venus such as it's density and size, which is enough to make people curious to how much about Venus we already know. He said that we know that Venus has many similar structures to Earth, such as mountains, valleys, and craters. If Venus is Earth's \"twin,\" doesn't mean that it is extremely similar to Earth? The statement could make people curious about how close Venus really is to Earth, or it could make them wonder why we should bother risking people's safety if we already know that Venus is just like Earth  He states that Venus is often referred to as Earth's \"twin\". This is because Venus and Earth are close in size, density, and at some points in orbit are the closest planets in the solar system. It is also believed that at one point, Venus was a lot like Earth is now. \"The Challenge of Exploring Venus\" states, \"Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our soloar system.\". The article goes on to say Venus most likely had large oceans that supported life, and the planet has things like craters, valleys, and mountains that we also have here on Earth. The author including these details helps get the point across that Venus is a lot like Earth, and with the little research been done already, we've found so much. This helps readers understand that the longer Venus is studied, the more we will learn about it.  Venus is the second planet in the solar system from the sun that precedes Earth in the planetary order. This planet is often called Earth's \"twin\" and the \"Evening Star\" of the universe because of its brightness and relative similarity to the Earth. In the article, \"The Challenge of Exploring Venus,\" the author presents facts and figures that one could use to determine whether studying Venus would be an advantageous pursuit even though it would not be very safe. The author focuses more on the drawbacks of exploring Venus, hence the title of this work. ",

People of all ages are beginning to rely on technology for everything from communication to transportation. Technology is being integrated more and more into the education system; changing the way students learn. In 2020, students receive and turn in homework online, read digitized textbooks, and even take tests over the internet.  Today, technology is rapidly advancing virtually everywhere. The iPhone, electric cars, large appliances, and many more useful new technological inventions have improved and helped assist everyone with their everyday tasks in a quick and resourceful manner. The new technology of the modern world is in workplaces, homes, and best of all, schools. Technology in school has rapidly increased especially as every student at Generic_School now has their own laptop for their own educational use. Now every student can get their work done through a computer at school, but not every student or teacher prefers it. Therefore, today, some schools offer distance learning for students to attend classes from home by way of online testing and course learning on their own. Many students and especially parents are skeptical of these online distance courses because they think that the old fashioned way of staying in school and using paper and pencil is the optimal way of learning. On the other hand, many people think otherwise, so this has become a great debate in the system of education for many counties and individual schools.  But this can easily be disputed, as various jobs are also shifting towards being heavily online. Being physically present is being phased out in almost every profession that doesn't need it in 2020. As for comprehension, digital technology is extremely versatile; it can be bent and modified to any extent that a person needs in order to be successful.  In this day and age, everything is always changing. New technologies and innovations bring about more efficient ways of completing tasks that were once tedious. One thing that hasn't changed in a long time, however, is the education system. Students commute to school, sit in class for eight hours, and then go home and do homework.  The use of technology improves people's daily lives, especially in school. With all the technology that we now have available, it is easier than ever to learn things, and with newer technology coming out it is only becoming easier.  Technology has a greater, more widespread impact on various facets of daily life than ever before. New technological developments now aid in routine, everyday tasks such as mail delivery, shopping, and even vacuuming the floor. One extremely common routine that technology is aiding in secondary schooling. In fact, many public and private schools at all levels are beginning to offer distance learning, or non-classroom settings such as virtual classes and video conferences that cover the same curriculum that a traditional classroom would  Within the past decade, humans have watched in awe as technology has improved exponentially, and learned to take on tasks once thought only humans could accomplish. Technology has been taught to communicate, entertain, solve problems, along with many other functions, and now it may be able to teach as well.  Currently the world is becoming more technologically advanced and most careers have adapted this new wave of advancements. It can be said that the computer focused aspect of distance learning will better prepare students for jobs such as these.  Today, we often depend on technology. From home to school to work, it is now an essential tool in our everyday lives. As the years go by, people are becoming more and more innovative in the ways they're using it. For instance, long distance learning is now being offered as a learning option for students.  Technology has become almost fully integrated into today's society. Computers, smart phones, and more are used in a positive aspect; the driverless car is no exception. ",

                "content": "in middle school, there's a lot of homework, even more so in high school. A lesson is usually about an hour and a half long. School ends at 3:30, so they'd get home at 5:00. 5 or 6 is the most common dinner time, and it usually lasts about 30 minutes. That's 5:30. Then, they have to go and try to finish their homework. If they have a lot of it, it can take a long time, and can usually lead to them putting off important stuff, like personal hygiene (GROSS!). They're probably super exhausted from their activity, and just want to take a shower. But nope, they have to do the rest of their homework. Depending on how much they have, they could end up staying up really late. Highschoolers can usually end up staying up until 3 am in the morning doing homework. That makes them more tired and not ready to focus the next day. It could've saved them so much more if they didn't have to do the activity.  One's house will most often contain most of their sources of entertainment, such as video games, food, hobbies, electronic devices, and more. As children with developing brains, staying on task with all of these factors\u00a0can only be accomplished by a few, but not the majority. A study conducted by the University of Virginia states that, \"almost 90% of students under the age of 18 have an attention span of about 10-30 minutes before becoming distracted\" (Generic_Name). This exemplifies how most students cannot stay focused in a video based classroom when there is no adult supervisor or teacher directly making sure they listen, which is quite difficult to achieve via distance learning. With this in mind, it is harder for students to have motivation to complete work during class time\u00a0when they have easy access to other sources of entertainment right at their fingertips. Thus, video based learning is detrimental to student's work ethic because it gives them no motivation to complete their work whereas in the normal school system, they would be forced to work on it during class because of a direct presence of an adult supervisor keeping them on track. All in all, a world without video learning for all students is a one that strengthen's one's work ethic through practice in the work place rather than at home.  As student at a public school the amount of work that is pilled on and the emotional stress of bullying enough to fall into depression. However, these problem turn into other problems for example, as a teenager your friends become and big part of your life in terms of what makes you happiest. What the current education system fails to realize\u00a0is that two days of seven are not enough to truly cherish your time. Online school eliminates the possibility of those students who are to busy because of school work and because of it have no social life.  To understand how fatigued they are, allow me to use an example of someone who is exhausted without the addition of extracurricular activities to their schedule: me. I wake up at 5:50, board my school bus at 6:30, attend school from 7:30 to 2:15, get home at 3:00, and do homework for four hours before eating dinner and going to sleep. Add three hours to the mix and I am going to bed at 11:00, giving me only six hours to sleep. Not seven, not eight, not nine, and certainly not ten. Following a routine where there is only time for six hours of sleep decreases concentration, slows thinking, damages memory, and can even stunt growth during puberty. Generic_School students cannot simply adapt to the new conditions. No middle school student can. That is why Generic_School students should not have to chronically attend extracurricular activities because it hurts students more than it helps them.  Throughout the school day, everyone has that one class they absolutely hate. They walk into the room and it's like a minute turns from 60 to 1,000 seconds and they are stuck there forever. In this time, nothing gets done and the same amount gets learned. This class consists of about half who actually care about what the subject is, and the other half who can't seem to control themselves enough to not act out in spite of not caring. The half of the students who actually pay attention are stuck with a teacher who has to repeat themselves\u00a0a thousand times a class period when they should be on another chapter by now. This not only frustrates the teacher and the students, but it creates negative air between the students and the teacher. I mean, who wouldn't hate a teacher that talks about the mitochondria a BILLION times a day? In this situation, some perks of distance learning are shown. The students who show passion to learn can be offered one-on-one time with the instructor through video conferencing, which will not only help the faster paced learners, but take away some of the tension in the classroom.  In the morning, most students have a routine they follow. If they have an activity that begins 45 minutes before school, they have to rearrange their whole schedule. This can lead to them losing sleep, not getting a good enough breakfast, and generally under prepared\u00a0for school. If a student has an after school activity, this can change and shorten their routine. If they get home, do homework, play games for 2 hours, eat dinner, shower, and then go to sleep, an activity can limit these things to less games or enjoyable activities, not as much of a dinner, and the day being taken up by mostly homework. It can cancel their time to relax or have fun, and cause a routine change. It shouldn't be up to the school to choose a students after or before school life, and throw off their entire schedule.  social skills, much like life skills, have their place in students' daily lives as well. It might not feel like it when teachers are constantly telling their classes to \"quiet down\" and \"focus on their assignments\", but the adults within the school building are just as aware of the psychological and emotional benefits of social interaction as teens. Therefore, students attending traditional public schools are alotted time, such as lunch or study hall, to hang out with friends and strengthen their interpersonal relationships. It is for these same reasons that most schools host memorable events outside of their eight-hour days for students to enjoy. Proms, talent shows, sporting events, and other staples of American high school serve no other purpose than providing social entertainment and positive experiences. On the other hand, online classes force students to spend countless hours sitting behind a computer screen, completely separated from their peers.  if you could a student could work from home that would change the way a student studies and complete assignment because they have time on their hands and also the are relaxed they would not have to sit in a class for over 55 minutes. Working at home could be very beneficial because It could be very difficult for another student to learn at school because they might be that one student who is making it hard for a student trying to focus or a student might be stressed because they might not have a ride to and back from school and worried that they might not enough time to finish their assignment and get it turned in on time. Working at home may not stress a student because they would have enough time to complete an assignment. This is why working on assignments at home would benefit a student.   \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0  We get tired because of all the stress and thinking we had to do all day. After a normal school day is over, kids are really tired and are exited to go home. We go to sleep late at night, and wake up relatively early, making it hard for us to get up, which makes us more tired than the average person. Making clubs required means that school will be extended. It is not reasonable to force the students to stay an additional few minutes to do more work. Even if the we are not tired from a school day, we still have loads of work to do after school. The same goes for the teachers. They don't want to teach kids for any longer. If the teachers have a bad day than it's even worse because they want to be alone. After their final teaching session is over, they have to do more work like grading test, projects, or homework. When school is over, I'm extremely exited to go home. I'm am sure that everyone else feels the same. If I had to stay in school for any longer, I wouldn't feel good when I come home. When I get home from the extra activity that I'm doing, I'll feel so drained and I won't be able to practice tennis, or focus on studying for a test. My English teacher, Generic_Name, says she is very tired from teaching all day. She thinks that there is no point in making kids more tired because they probably can't do their work correctly at home. With the tired students and teachers, there is no point in required extracurricular activities.  With traditional schooling methods, students are placed in classes of as many as thirty peers all trying to obtain the same education and lesson within the time constraints of the class. As with any large group of adolescents, some students will quickly catch on, while some will take longer to grasp the material. However, when one teacher is controlling a classroom of thirty different learning paces, they have to attempt to find a happy medium to teach the curriculum, and they are additionally limited to the constraint of a 45- to ninety-minute class period. This leaves the quicker students bored and unsatisfied while the slower students are left to struggle to continue to catch up to the teacher's pace. This issue is especially prevalent in an AP or college level class, where there is a lot of material thrown at the students at once. With distance learning, however, students have the benefit of learning at their own pace. Because of the eternal availability of the internet and email as well as abundant resources both in virtual classrooms and on the web, students are able to quickly tackle the subjects that come easy to them while also able to slow down, ask questions, and get additional help on topics that they struggle on. By not having to conform to a teacher's pace, students are more likely to succeed at their own pace, which is encouraged through distance learning. ",

                "content": "If it seems like there is repeats or everyone is saying the same thing, then go with that thing that is repeated. When the majority think that it is the best possible solution there's a good chance it actually is the best possible solution. Another thing that may happen is the advice may go back and forth and you are getting a lot of both sides or both opinions. Then in this case you can see which side has more experienced people giving you that opinion. For example lets say I am doing a school project and want to figure out how to organize it. Would I use my two younger siblings advice even though they have never done this type of school work, or would I take advice from my parents and older sibling who have experience. The answer is obvious, even though there are almost an even amount of people on both sides, you stick with who has experience. Finally my favorite way of using comparing and contrasting the advice. If you have a bunch of different opinions and none of them really match up or there are no patterns and repeats, you get to make it. In this case you can pick and pull parts from all the advice and build your own advice for yourself based off of other people's ideas. Being able to compare and contrast the advice you receive gives you a big advantage on how you want to deal with your issue.  Having input from both sides of a spectrum can help you find out what is better to do in a situation. In other words, a multitude of opinions can help you find a middleman of sorts to resolve the issue. Additionally, in some cases having multiple viewpoints can cause a realization that will please both sides.  In an argument people tend to be very blindsided and naive, because they always think they are in the right. However there are always two sides to every story, and other people can help you see both. Many times you don't understand what someone else might be going through and it is always good for someone to humble you every now and then to make you understand others. Whenever something is going wrong, it's necessary to understand it ask someone else what they think by viewing all sides or the problem.  If someone has a different opinion or reasoning on a topic, they could help you to look at the issue from their point of view, which might change your mind on the matter.  Being able to look at a problem from both sides of the argument could positively affect your decision, whether it's choosing a side or settling on a compromise.  For example, if you're not sure you should tryout for a team, or be involved in a school play, ask for opinions from your parents and friends to see what they think you should do.  Their input would not only help you make a decision, but also build your confidence in what you're trying to achieve.  Getting multiple opinions on an issue would really help to make better choices on the topic.  Before coming to a definite decision it is very helpful to have a complete understanding of both sides. This ensures that you pick the best possible choice. Advice can be great especially when you want to please everyone with the choice that you made. You should try to please everyone with your decision, but be sure you listen to everyone before choosing.  To solve the problem in a way that is pleasing to both sides, I propose to you a compromise. If a student keeps a grade average of an A, community service will be optional. If a student's grades fall below that, community service will be a requirement.  It you have two opinions you will be able to see both sides of the problem therefore making it easier to for you to make the right choice. Having only one opinion is definitely worse than having multiple because you are unable to have the option to see the other side. The one opinion could lead you into making some wrong choices, yet have multiple will lead to make some of the better choices that you could have made. Having the most opinions possible could change your life for the better, and possibly make your life easier. Although, receiving multiple opinions could sound easy it is quite difficult, due to the fact that nit everyone is going to want to help you. Some people in our world will not want you to succeed. However one opinion is worse than having multiple because you are unable to see everything that could be harmful towards you.  Beyond the thesis, the author used many counter-arguements in their writing. This is one of their strong suits, acknowledging both sides of an arguement is one of the best ways to convey your opinion affectively, while still being able to keep opposing side of the arguement interested and have their minds open to change  A lot of people on the other side say rule goes against people's right to make a choice for themselves. The most common example they use for this is that, in a study made by Mental Psychology University, 40% of students with lower self esteem and social problems often stay in their shell, out of habit and anger of being forced to participate.  Electoral College believers think that having electors go on either side to let one canidate win, is right. \"Knowing their vote will have no effect, they have less incentive to pay attention to the campaign than they would have if the president were picked by popular vote..\"(Posner). So these Electoral College followers agree with the electors actually selecting the winner because they don't have to do anything. People can just sit back and watch the electors take the power, while the others do nothing but be slumps. In source one, the Office of the Federal Register mention that \"when you vote for your candidate you are actually voting for your candidate's electors.\", which means that if voters have friends in the position of an elector, voters might just vote for the elector because theres nothing else to really pay attention to.

As it was passing over a strip of Mars called Cydonia, it snapped a picture that would cause an uproar in space exploration. This new picture showed what seemed to be a human face. A few days later NASA reveled these pictures for the world to see; it was an instant hit  In 1976 the face looked like a face. In 1998 it started to not look like a face at all. In 2001 it just looked like a rock. So i believe that it was not created by aliens but that it was just something the olanet had made itself. This has certainly got the attention of the people.  The \"Face on Mars\" is not a face. If you look at the pictures from 1976, and 1998, and 2001 and in the text it says that the photo from 2001 is the most recent photo that NASA has. It still looks nothing like a face so since the 2001 picture is the most recent it shows that it is just a natural landform. It is just a natural landform. On Mars there are natural landforms everywhere and the fade away. Here on earth natural landforms are created everyday.  n paragraph 10 it says,\" ...43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo.\" This shows that the photo didn't give very compelling evidence that there was life on Mars. soon later NASA and their supporters claimed that this face is just an act of nature is because of the 1998 Global Surveyor spacecraft. This new spaceship passed over the red planet to take pictures of the \"face on Mars\". The pictures were ten times better than the last pictures of Cydonia this time. The new photos clearly showed a landform on Mars and not a man.  As discussed before, NASA has taken a new and better quality photo of the Face in Cydonia. Using our scientific equiopment at NASA, we have proven just how much better the resolution is on the new phototgraph taken is. \"\"As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger that the pixel size,\" he added. So if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the gtround or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!\"\" (p. 11). This quote from the article shows  The world today contains numerous conspiracy theories. One of these conspiracies is about the mysterious face on Mars. Some conspiracy theorists state that the face on Mars is actually a result of Alien life.  It does look like it could be from another living organism, but it's just a rock on the planet. In our newest image of the rock, it turns out that the face has dissapered. There is no evidence of this being created by aliens, rather it was created by wind and water that has been found on Mars. The reason you might believe that this was indeed aliens, might be the fact that the news has blown it out of poportion. It's just the rock that had some interesting shadows and holes that made it look like a human face.  So in conclusion it is not a alien made face it simply in a mesa or a landmark on Mars. The proof is in the article when you see the 3 picutes that were taken to prove it wasn't a alien made artifact. No matter how cool it would be if it was not to mention that it could make NASA famous or rich it just doesn't have the proof you need to be a alien artifact. If you look more into the passage it even says it was not a alien made artiffact. Yes this face was very famous it even says \"The \"Face\" on Mars has since been a pop icon. It has starred in a Hollywood film, apperered in books, magazines, and even radio shows.\" (5). See how famous that face was 25 years ago is amazing but it still doesn't mean it was a alien made artiffact. So in final say it is not a alien made face and nor will there be enough proof its just a landmark on Mars that was very popular to people everywhere!            NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft has found something while circling  Mars. But what is it, they have seem to have found a face formed into the rocks. Is this new discovery actually a face or is it just another rock formation.  The believers and the non-believers of the face on Mars are waiting anxiously to find out what it is. Is it a rock formation or is it an actual human face, no one knows  In 1988 a Viking 1 took a, slightly disturbing, picture. Of a face! Viking 1 found a landform that happends to look like an Egyptian Pharoah. This face was found and started major controversy.  Some people had thought that it was fake and others thought that it was just a coincidence. The massive sand storms just created a face. That's all that they thought. But can that be true?   The curiousity about Mars has been going on for centuries.  People say that there is or once was life on Mars, and now they are saying that there is a face on Mars.  Humans all around the world have questioned whether the \"Face\" was created by aliens or just a natural landform. ",

                "content": "If students are not focusing on their work and only on sports and other extra activities, then they are defeating the purpose of school.  Students who have a grade average of a C should focus more on learning in school before they worry about playing sports or joining other clubs at the school.  If the policy was changed so that students could only participate in sports or other activities if they had a grade average of a B or higher, then you would insure that they were coming to school and learning and staying on track to becoming successful later in their lives, not just coming to school to play sports or participate in extra-curricular activities.  Well many people including me have a C average as our grade. But that doesn't mean you should punish us. We very well could be failing but were trying our very hardest to not be. Many things in the curriculum are very difficult for us to grasp, and understand, but that doesn't mean we aren't trying our very hardest to get our grades up. now this is not the case for every student, but in my case it is. I am having a great deal of difficulty in math right now, and that's because we are covering an area of material that I don't fully understand. I keep trying harder and harder everyday but the formulas and numbers just don't add to me. But I have had a great grade in this class all year until we got onto this subject  You also should keep this as a school policy because you shouldn't be able to participate if you are either failing a class or struggling to pass that class you need you won't be able to have any ability to do so in school sports and all. The student is just taking the class for nothing if he/she is failing just to be in a sport and that they don't care about their grade. He/she needs to keep a B average to be able to participate for that gain of socializing and gaining special abilities.   That in itself will give the student athletes more breathing room so they will have an easier time bringer their grades up. If these work than you can keep the required average at a C, but if these fail, that is when you would be obliged to make the required average a B so the students have more drive to keep their grades up. But at the time I think you should change the limitations of the sports programs in itself before any of the grade requirements are changed.  For example, if a basketball player receives a 65 on a test. Tell them that they can't start their next game unless they can pull it back up. Also, if you have tutors ( especially for the ones who struggle in math) it could help then bring their grades up to a B and possibly an A. These kids don't purposely try not to accomplish As its just hard for them to do it. All they need is a push.  In conclusion, changing the policy to participate in sports and other activities to having an average grade of a B instead of a C should be done.  This would require students to have to focus on the purpose of school, learning, before anything else.  Also, if students have a grade of a C, then they should have to spend the time they would use for sports or other activities to raise their grade.  Finally, being able to participate in sports and other activities should be a reward for working hard and receiving good grades.  As you can see, this is a policy change that should be made, as the opportunity to play sports and partake in other extra-curricular activities should be earned, not given.  there is no need to change the grade average to a B. There is no point to it. The team and kids are doing fine just the way it is and changing the grade average will make a big difference, and not in a good way. kids will stop trying out because there is just too much going on and they cant keep up. plus a C is a passing grade and students want to get a higher grade then that because its risky at a C itself. some kids are already struggling and raising the grade will just make it harder. Leave the average the way it is because i could guarantee you that it will not be a good idea. you don't know what kids have to do after school, or go through, and if the students and teachers and coaches are happy then what is the harm?  I think in the end that this would be a good thing because it would make students want to try harder in school if they really like a sport and wanted to bring their grade up to be able to play this sport. Then again i think every school should have to have this rule because it would be unfair to one team if the other team did not have the players they wanted because of this rule. I think you could take this rule and put it into school systems and see improvement all over the state then maybe all over the country. So yes i think that even though it would cause a lot of trouble it would be a good thing to raise grades all over the country.  the students are keeping up their grade, and when their grade is getting lower (to a low c) the coach talks to them, saying that they better be careful. it scares the students to be getting a c because that's the boundary line. they shoot for getting an A or B anyways so it wont make a difference. It is just going to scare the kids. Also by changing the grade average it is most likely going to bring down the team numbers. Not as many kids are going to try out because of that. changing even just a little thing makes a big difference, and changing this will make even a bigger difference.  Again, I think that if they can't try in school they should' t be allowed to try in sports. If they aren't getting bad grades from lack of trying though that where the help should be offered. I just think that sports are important too and if they bring their grade up they can enjoy sports and grades all the more. ",

Freedom will also make students more motivated to complete their projects, because they are free to do anything.. Freedom can also allow students to be critical thinkers.

That is why making a right choice is important, and a person can only make the best decision when they have talked with more than one person.\u00a0   \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  if the President thinks that this is the best time for their country to go to war, but they don't know if any of the people they rule over, or even the rest of the government, thinks the same way, it would almost certainly make the president feel less confident in their decision than if they knew what people thought about their decision, and they might not do as good a job running the country because they might stress about it. But if they consulted many advisers before making that vital decision, the advisers might agree with the president, resulting in the president feeling more confident with their decision and ultimately leading the country better than if they just went with what one person said and didn't ask multiple people for advice first.  If many people say to not do something then the person knows that majority of people agree it will only do them harm. It is the same for the things a person should do. If many people have the same advice then they know that it's the right thing to do. Indecisiveness is prevalent in many people. Having several voices present\u00a0should enforce the person to make a decision. Someone can also put together all of the advice they get and find the common denominator of the advice. Making the person self assured about following the advice people gave, because so many of their peers thought the same way. You can tweak all of the advice to create a better idea or a stronger piece of advice. Usually your own advice is best for yourself, so adding other people's advice to your own can help you make a greater choice.  People ask for advice, because sometimes they can't make the choice on their own. It's also not a bad thing to do when you are stuck and need some advice from other people. When people make choices on their own and don't ask anyone for help, they tend to make a bad decision. Some people feel trapped when trying to ask someone they trust for advice, because they are scared about how they are going to react. So then they don't ask them and then the problem they were trying to solve turns into a even bigger problem then before. Then at the last moment they decide to tell or ask the person for advice when it's already too late. Sometimes it can create another problem that they are going to have to solve, or it solves the problem  In order to make the best decisions possible, mankind must learn to ask for advice from others. Asking for advice can help change the world in a positive way because the decisions people make will most likely have a good outcome for the community around them. Seeking advice before making choices and plans is very important because mistakes can be avoided and different opinions can be heard.   \u00a0 \u00a0  The first step to make a good decision is to think about your conquences. Some people make a decision and regret it because they did not think about their conquences. For example, when people go to jail, they regret their descision they made because it changed their life in a horrible way. Other peoples opinions can lead you into a bad direction, if you dont think about the possible outcomes. There can be some bad outcomes when you listen to peoples opinions, but if you chose carefully and follow the correct steps it will not be so bad. If someone is per-persuring you, that is never the right way to listen someones advice because they are forcing you. Always listen to yourself when someone is forcing you and not always be a follower, but also listen to other opinons when they are not forcing you.  It is natural to seek for advice or opinions from many people throughout life. People may ask for opinions from family or friends to solve an issue. Even so, a person might still require more opinions for confirmation or to seek a well thought solution. Such as, when a student messes up badly on a project, he or she will probably ask a teacher or friend for their opinion on what they should do to fix the mistake. But, the individual could end up asking his or her parents for their say on the matter.  Today, many cars all across America and the world have road assistance and antilock breaks, but this still gives drivers the oppurtunity to make a mistake and cause an accident.  Before making a decision, if you are given bad advice you have the opportunity to hear other opinions and correct the mistake. It can also help if you are given a bad opinion and have other input to help you realize which is the best option. Plus, when given multiple opinions you will allways have other advice to fall back on just in case.   There is also the consideration of laws. In our current era, whoever hits someone initially in a traffic collision, is the one to blame, and the one who helps pay off the other driver's bill. Human error is a natural thing, and we all make mistakes, but if there is ever an accident in which an autonomous car is made and is involved in an accident, who is responsible in the end? Is it the driver, or is it the car which is supposed to be incapable of making mistakes? ",

Posner comes back and states \"no region has enough electoral votes to elect a president. In this quote its supports the fact that the electors do choose who they please. Plus this makes it fair because candidates wont be getting votes all over the places. Also the electoral college will be trust wirthy because the college follows the majority of the people's vote, and then makes a vaild decision.  but a successful president should be able to sway the whole country into voting for him, not just a certain region. Thus, showing that regional advantages prove meaningless with the Electoral College, making it less unfair to other regions.  Not one region or state has enough electoral votes to elect a president (Par 19 and 21).\u00a0 This is a good thing because canidates pay equal attention to all of America's people.\u00a0 Also, in the Electoral College, not every state has the same amount of electoral votes because every state has a different population size.\u00a0  This is crutial because \"a candidate with only regional appeal is unlikely to be a successful president\" (Posner).\u00a0 With the Electoral College in place it makes it impossible to for a candidate with only regional appeal to become president because no region has enough electoral votes to elect them  Source 3 brings up the fact that no region in the United States has enough electoral votes to elect a president. The \"winner-take-all\" system further benefits this, because in order to win, candidates have to focus their attention on states where their majority vote is insecure. They will not focus on regions where they have essentially secured the majority rule and therefore secured all the electoral votes. In popular vote, they would have to focus extensively on those regions, as the few that are not in the majority would need convincing. Source 3 goes into detail as to why a regionally picked candidate is not a proper show of the will of the people. It states that \"The residents of other regions are likely to feel disenfranchised - to feel that thier votes do not count, that their new preident will have no regard for their interests...\", and so having a trans-regional appeal is essential to properly representing the will of United States citizens  Some may argue that no region has enough electoral votes to elect a president but regions do have the power to swing an election in an enourmous way. An effect of the winner take all system is candidates not going to certain states if they know they can not win it. This can basically stop some voters from wasting time and voting because they may feel there personal vote would make no difference. In the 2000 election \"17 states did not see candidates at all.\" according to Bradford Plumer. How could somebody possibly feel engaged in an election if whoever is running finds there vote unimportantant to them winning the election.  In essence, the Electoral College is necessary for the balance and order in the United States to remain. It provides a fair representation and campaign for all regions, allows votes from states with fewer population numbers to have significance, and avoids the issue of trying to determine the president when neither receives the majority vote. This all shows that fewer problems arise when using this procedure, rather than if they use majority vote. \"You help choose your state's electors when you vote for President because when you vote for your candidate you are actually voting for your candidate's electors.\" This shows that the citizens still have power in choosing their candidate and it creates a balance with other parties. In conclusion, the Electoral College should be kept to preserve the integrity and equality the United States is all about.     While popular voting can be skewed naturally to one region or another due to their preferences and populations, the Electoral College ensures that one region can't win a campaign alone. If the President was to win due to popular vote and only because of regional appeal, \"residents of other regions are likely to feel disenfranchised...\" (Posner Source 3) and that their president will not best represent everyone's interests.  The Electoral college voting system is not fair in the way the present system works. The system does not show proper representation of the people, does not promote interest in voting, and causes a candidate to ignore the states in which do not have a large amount of electoral votes.  The Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal.\" \"This is a desireable result because a candidate with only regional appeal is unlikely to be a successful president.\" This shows that it is beneficial because it makes a candidate who has only regional appeal, have to work harder in other states to show that he would be fair to all states, not just the ones that support him. Furthermore, it allows for massive regional advantages, like the South, mean nothing because they would still have to convince the North to vote for them. ",

Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and the AFL-CIO all agreed on one thing, and it was aboloshing the Electoral College. Under the Electoral College System they vote not for the president but for a state of electors who in return elect the president. Last but not least, the Electoral College is just unfair in so many differnt ways. These are reasons why I am not in favor of the Electoral College but in the favor to elect by popular vote for the president of the United States of America.       The Electoral College should also be changed to election by popular vote, because people consider it non-democratic. This is because the voting is all up to the electors selected by each of the different states, meaning that the actual people of the state have no power in the election of the candidates for president.  Electoral college has helped in many ways. Many people have suggested keeping the electoral college or changing to election by popular vote for the president of United States.  To conclude I belive that my state senator should remove the electoral colleges. To change the election by popular vote for the president of the United States. For the fact that voters vote not for the president but for a slate of electors. Who can always defy the will of the people. It should also be removed because its simply unfair to the voters. There votes may or may not be counted or may vote for the wrong person or oppsite party. The Electoral College is unfair, outdated, and irrational.     You cannot deny, changing to election by popular vote for the president of the United States would be extremely beneficial for our country. Citizens would regain their Constitutional-right to vote for the leaders who make major decisions for the entire country. The Electoral College is useful to produce a clear winner in elections, but is evidently not completely necessary and is unfair to voters who want and deserve a say in the outcome(Plumer 13, 14). Abolishing this system would cause for a drastically more fair election and greater citizen satisfaction for multitudinous reasons. Please consider.  im writting this letter to you so you consider changing to election by popular vote for the prsident of the united states instead of electoral college. i belive like branford plumer, that the electoral college is very wrong not only because under the electoral college system, voters dont vote for the president but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president. but also because it is very unfair to voters, candidates dont spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the \"swing\" states.  it is considered a non-democratic method for selecting a president, and it is all up to the electors of a candidate. The Electoral College should also be changed to popular vote because it is not the people who are choosing the president, it is the three electors sent from each different state.  When the Constitution of the United States was written our founding fathers decided on an Electoral College as the way to ellect the president instead of a direct vote. The Electoral College is a process that makes a compromise between the popular vote of the citizens and the Congressional vote. When citizens vote for president they are actually voting for a member of the Electoral College that is going to select their president, rather than the citizens voting for the president themselves. The Electoral College is made of 538 electors, the number of electors from each state varies depending on the states Congressional delegation. Washington D.C. is counted as a state for this process and alloted only three electors.  Using the popular vote as the one and only way of electing presidents is needed in this country. The choice of presidents should be soley up to the american people. There should be no electoral college that can totally change the outcome of a election because one candidate doesent have enough electoral votes.  The United States has ways of being civilaized, and thats by electing leaders. Those leaders that take role of the responsiblitiy are President. Presidents need candidates to vote for them. The only way the President will get elected is by the Electoral College or by popular vote. Although both ways are effective, only one way is the best. ",

If we some how passes through the atmosphere, than we'll face ANOTHER problem with the ground. Since Venus is the second planet from our sun and with all those carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, the surface ground temperature is over 800 DEGREES FAHRENHEIT. In which with the surface and the atmosphere, it could basically melt many types of metal with no problem. Another Problem is that the atmosphereic preassure is 90x greater than our Earth, with that much preassure could easily crushed a submarine that is built to surrvive the deeper end of the ocean. From what we gather small information from our space craft, the geology of venus pretty much have erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lighting strikes.  The author goes on to list the physical dangers of Venus: \"On the planet\u0092s surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet\" (The Challenge 3). On Venus, the temperature alone could liquify many metals and completely destroy spacecrafts that were sent there. Also, the pressure of the atmosphere could crush a submarine fit for diving to the deepest parts of the ocean.  Venus has a temperature that humans can not survive in, 800 degrees Fahrenheit. Also on Venus the pressure is 90 times what humans experience on Earth. Humans have never experienced conditions as extreme as those on Venus: \"Even a submarine accustomed to diving to the deepest parts of [the] oceans\" would be crushed and the high temperatures \"would liquefy many metals.\" Something that was made to be able to go withstand high pressures, like a submarine, would be crushed on Venus, and metals can withstand very high temperatures but on venus they would liqeufy. It is unsafe and humanly impossible for humans to try to explore the land of Venus when some of the best technology can not even withstand the climate of Venus.  Venus has features such as mountains, craters, and even valleys that are also seen on Earth. According to the article, its atmosphere is 97% carbon dioxide with temperatures averging 800 degrees Fahrenheit. Atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than Earth with can crush nearly anything that tries to reach its surface and even liquefy metals. The second paragraph discussed how spacecrafts in the past barely lasted a few hours and since there hasn't been a spacecraft sent there in more than three decades. This evidence shows that despite the success of reaching Venus, we are not even close to even slowly progressing and fixing smaller issues with spacecrafts traveling there and back to Earth.  A planet that has enough heat and pressure to melt most metals and crush any submarine may not sound like an ideal location to visit, but scientists at NASA are determined on researching it because even though it has horribly immense climate, it may be the closest planet in our solar system to Earth. The article \"The Challenge of Exploring Venus,\" the author speaks of how scientists strongly believe that learning more about Venus can lead to answers about the creation of Earth. It is an extremely difficult task to accomplish, as most rovers NASA has sent there have not lasted more than a mere few hours. In order to research the planet in depth, NASA would need to send living humans to Venus, however, this will be rediculously challenging and even more so dangerous.  With Sulfuric Acid in Venus' atmosphere, and surface temperatures being over 425 degrees Celcius (about 700 K or 800 F) , the likelyhood of humans on Venus is nearly nonexistent to begin with. To combat the hot temperatures and the acidic atmosphere, NASA proposed the idea of a \"blimp\" that floats above the planet's shell. Although the blimp could survive high in the air, the practicality of if is not present. Having a blimp that cannot touch the planet is not going to help scientific research at all. While being above the clouds of Venus, it is impossible to see the surface with human eyes. Seeing the surface would require technology that uses light from the electromagnetic spectrum with a high frequency and short wavelength. It is also impossible to collect rock samples from the planet for soil examination. This idea would not be beneficial enough for the risk of investing a lot of time and money.  but in reality, Earth and Venus are very differnet. Earth is much safer in terms of temperature, pressure, and gas compaired to Venus. Venus has a blanket of gas that covers it that is, \"almost 97 percent carbon dioxide.\" Plus, on its surface, \"temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit.\" with the level of carbon dioxide and the ragging heat that it has, nothing is safe for long on Venus, especially humans. He does state that several spacecrafts have attempted to land on Venus, and only lasted a few hours, but he doesnt state what happened to them. most people would guess that they just melted entirely because of the extreme heat, which is most likely what happened, but we don't know for sure.  The next problem that Earth faces in studying Venus is that temperatures on this planet exceed 800 degrees Fahrenheit, a temperature found nowhere on Earth  This, in turn, aids in convincing readers that might have originally disgareed with the author due to the fact that Venus' \"conditions are fare more extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth; such an environment would crush even a submarine assustomed to diving to the deepest parts of our oceans and would liquefy many metals,\" (3). The author, after making this counterclaim, refutes it by talking of some solutions to this ever-looming issue: \"NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions of the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray. Imagine a blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the roiling Venusian landscape,\" (5). The author talks of how the air pressure, temperature and radiation would all be survivable for humans. Some, such as the air pressure 30 miles above Venus, would be almost identical to Earth at sea level.  In the text it says, \" Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere. On the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet.\" In addition, the article also states, \"Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system, even though Mercury is closer to our sun.\" The conditions on that planet Venus are much worse than on Eath, the planet contains such heat that it is over 800 degrees Fahrenheit.

                "content": "The author of \"The Challenge of Exploring Venus\" did a fair job at arguing their claim, that Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents.  Overall, the author of \"The Challenge of Exploring Venus\" makes a claim that although Venus has some exceptionally dangerous conditions, it is a planet worth exploring. They support this claim very well by explaining the importance of going to Venus, and providing a few solutions that might reduce the risk factor of this type of mission. All in all, this author, much like Audrey Hepburn, proves through this article that they feel that nothing is truly impossible, not even a trip to Venus.  Throughtout the article, \"The Challenge of Exploring Venus,\" the author presents infomation for exploring Venus being both beneficial and harmful,  He states that Venus is often referred to as Earth's \"twin\". This is because Venus and Earth are close in size, density, and at some points in orbit are the closest planets in the solar system. It is also believed that at one point, Venus was a lot like Earth is now. \"The Challenge of Exploring Venus\" states, \"Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our soloar system.\". The article goes on to say Venus most likely had large oceans that supported life, and the planet has things like craters, valleys, and mountains that we also have here on Earth. The author including these details helps get the point across that Venus is a lot like Earth, and with the little research been done already, we've found so much. This helps readers understand that the longer Venus is studied, the more we will learn about it.  He does not support this idea throughly, giving limited information to convice the reader of his claim. He only says it can last in challenging conditions for a limired amount of time, but does not mention any support, leaving silicon carbide as his weakest support on how using that, can convice people that Venus is a worthy pursit depsite the dangers it possesses. He uses only one fact, but not not give enough anaylsis to make his argument strong or very clear.  To illistrate, \"...human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors\" (8). The author explains how humans are naturally curious, and how this curiosity often times leads them to dangerous situations. Studying Venus has its dangers, but it is no different. Also stated, \"Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation\" (8). The author is promoting curiosity because it leads us to new things. Curiosity can overcome the fear of danger when exploring Venus to help us learn new things about the planet. To summarize, the power of curiosity in people is something the author uses to support their opinion of Venus being worth it to explore.   First, the author brings up his topic of \" Studying Venus is a worhty pursuit despite the dangers it presents\". Despite this, the author only gave one full paragraph, out of the eight he wrote, on why humans would want to explore the planet ; he then preceeded to go onto the dangers of Venus, rather than why it is worth exploring.  Combining the evidence presented by the author would point to the conclusion that astronomers would need to be using vehicles and photography equipment that currently don't exist and, even with unavailable technology, they must be willing to die to travel to Venus for study.  This creates the idea in the reader's head that studying Venus is impossible, which greatly weakens the author's claim.  All in all, impossibilities, conflicting ideas, and a lack of explanation of evidence crontribute to a weak argument in favor of the idea that studing Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents.  Exploring Venus would a beinificail and woth while scientific endver. Over the years Venus has been a topic of study due to its earth like qualites. The temperature of Venus is not as freindly to humans as our own atmosphereVenus is one the closest planets to own planet than most others. Lastly, the exploration of venus can be the next ground breaking scientific discovery yet.  The author of \"The Callenge of Exploring Venus\" did a fair job when arguing that Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. While the author did accurately present the dangers and solutions for the dangerous parts of exploring Venus, they failed to create a strong thesis. The author exceeded when giving factual information about the topic to help the reading get on their side of the arguement; do to them struggling to get across their position on if Venus exploration is worthwhile, some of the provided information they gave was not used to it's full potential when changing the reader's opinion.

This is said in the text when it says, \"Using imagery, the new emotion-recognition software tracks these facial movements,\" (D'Alto 4). One can see from this that the students would always have to be watched and their facial movements would all be recorded. This could be an issue of privacy for some students if they do not want to constantly be recorded. It also makes it easy for outside threats to hack this system and watch students or get personal information from the videos.  Students may also use this feature in art classes to really capture what the artist was depicting in the work. For instance, this new software was able to create percentages of Mona Lisa's emotions. The latest innovation in computer software may be very useful for art classes, knowing how a person may be feeling in a painting may help students to depict the artists work, a bit better. As humans, we can tell how someone may be feeling by the look on their face, or the look in their eyes. Most of us would have trouble trying to describe what facial expressions convey being happy, besides a smile. The computer can make exact percentages on each emotion you may be feeling.  Slip into a world where emotions are easily read. There could be no mind games, no pettiness, and no suffering in silence;this could be the new reality. In the article \"Making Mona Lisa Smile\" by Nick D'Alto, he introduces a new concept created by Thomas Haung:Facial Action Coding System software. This programming system allows computers to register all of the emotions on an individual's face, reguardless if they are mixed.  According to the article \"Making Mona Lisa Smile,\" there is a new technology called the Facial Action Coding System (FACS) that enables computers to identify human emotions. This technology is relatively brand new. It creates a 3-D computer model of all fourty-four major muscles in the face that move like human muscles as well. Then, psychologists have classified six basic emotions that are associated with different movements in the facial mucles. This new technology could result in many benefits in our community as well as all around the world  In the sixth paragraph of the article \"Making Mona Lisa Smile,\" the author illuminates the possibilites of success human-emotion-recognizing computer software provides in terms the world of marketing, describing how analyzing the emotional response to a Web ad popping up on one's computer screen can mold the variety of its future ads to a more preferred selection (6).  At the seventh passage, the author states that, \"Your home PC can't handle the complex algorithms used to decode Mona Lisa's smile,\" suggesting that the majority of modern computers do not have the power to actually run the software. The PCs that schools buy are almost never more powerful than the ones bought by consumers for household use, and would thus also not be able to process the data, making the technology rather useless in an educational setting.  Leonardo Da Vinci was one of the greatest reniassance painters of the time. His study of the human anatomy allowed him to create pictures that captured the humna state. On of his most well known paintings is the \"Mona Lisa\". The Mona Lisa is a women that has sort of complacent facial features. She doesn't really look happy or sad. This was the popular thought up until a new technology was created. This technology is called the Facial Action Coding System. This technology is able to deduce what emotion a person is feeling. It is able to do this whothout the person even showing an obvious emotion. This technology can also be implenmented in many spheres of life, including in the classroom.  In the article \"Making Mona Lisa Smile,\" the author explains how certain algorithms built into a system, called the Facial Action Coding System, can detect human emotions. In the article, the author describes how a classroom computer can recognize when a student is getting bored or confused based on their facial expressions. This computer can change the way that the lesson is being taught so that the students are more productive in classes. ",

I think that if everyone was to be able to individually vote for their president, there would be less chaos and arguements about the election and also the new president.\u00a0But,\u00a0it is possible that the winner of the electoral vote won't win the national popular vote. But, it is very rare. Some people don't bother voting because of the fact that their vote will have no effect. They have less incentive to pay attention to the campaign than they would have if the president were picked by popular vote.  For example, many young voters base their votes off of popular opinion, not what they think is actually right. If there was no Electoral College, the Nation could be in a lot of trouble because many votes would be casted off of popular opinion. So it is good to have some control over what happens and who becomes president, but I think having the full decision to vote for whomever, and have it count, is overdoing it.  Not only can they win the popular vote but still lose the presidency, they also risk the event of a tie were the vote would then go to the House of Representatives.  Also, many states may not even see the future president at all, like in the 2000 election where the candidates did not even go once and talk in seventeen states. This leads to a poor democracy because voters in these states will surmise that if the president will not bother to visit their state, they shouldn't bother on making an educated decision when voting, or may choose to not vote at all. In a election by popular vote, presidents will have to make greater strides in getting the people's votes and citizens will then have more of an impetus in learning more about their country's government and politics.  In conclusion, the Electoral College seems unconstitutional, since a variety of issues can occur due to the many problems that could potentially occur. The United States should shift into a more reasonable and logical means of electing our president in our Republic, where everybody is equal. The Electoral College should no longer decide the president based on the possibility of a tie, the possibility for betrayal of trust and disputes due to how close the votes are. The system should change to where the popular opinion should\u00a0 decide on the president of the United States of America, making people believe that their vote will be fairly counted.  Plumer quotes, \"Given that many voters vote one party for president and another for Congress, the House's selection can hardly be expected to...unfair.\" This would not happen if the U.S adopts the popular vote method, where the most popular candidate will win and reflect the citizens who placed him or her into office. The Electoral College is nothing other than unfair to the citizens who rely on it to elect their president.  Now, if this predicament occurs in near half of our 50 states, a candidate who did not recieve the popular vote will reign triumphant over a candidate who a majority of the American people elected to be their new president.  The popular vote is a clear statement of voters' opinions and is virtually unable to be tampered with. On the other hand, the Electoral College only complicates the situation by introducing a middle man who is prone to bribery and mistakes. Why should we allow candidates to win because of the electoral vote if they do not recieve the overall approval of the public? Compare the opinions of 538 electors to the opinions of hundreds of millions of voters. Evidently, the opinions of all these voters cannot be properly represented by these 538 electors. It's just impossible both logistically and logically.  the person who has the popular vote may not win presidency,  To conclude, the state senator should favor in keeping the Electoral College rather than changing to election be popular vote for the president of the United States because less disputes will occur and not participating will not be effective.       \u00a0   ",

                "content": "The face has been a pop icon ever since the discovery of the formation. the face will always be a piece of history and will always been known to man. If there was an actual face on Mars then that would be a sign of life. The face ended up eing a mesa and nothing else besides that. Although it would have been an exciting discovery for NASA, we still have much more of space that is unknown and unexplored. NASA is bound to find some kind of incredible object. We will have to wait until that day comes and find something incredible and will be part of the incredible true story of space.              So in conclusion it is not a alien made face it simply in a mesa or a landmark on Mars. The proof is in the article when you see the 3 picutes that were taken to prove it wasn't a alien made artifact. No matter how cool it would be if it was not to mention that it could make NASA famous or rich it just doesn't have the proof you need to be a alien artifact. If you look more into the passage it even says it was not a alien made artiffact. Yes this face was very famous it even says \"The \"Face\" on Mars has since been a pop icon. It has starred in a Hollywood film, apperered in books, magazines, and even radio shows.\" (5). See how famous that face was 25 years ago is amazing but it still doesn't mean it was a alien made artiffact. So in final say it is not a alien made face and nor will there be enough proof its just a landmark on Mars that was very popular to people everywhere!            With very high resolutioned photos, it is hard for conspiracy theorists to still say that there is face on Mars. It even says in paragraph 11,\" So if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!\"  When the face on Mars was originally captured, there was no such thing. The article explains that when the picture was originally captured in 1976, the camera quality was not great. For example the text states, \"Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo.\" So, when given a better camera quality than in 1976, the face on mars no longer looks like a defined face. Although the quality of the camera is a great support, there are many other explanations that put an end to conspiracy theorists.  In recent years many citicens have stated that the so called \"face on mars\" is a martion monument. Well I have but one question for those few citicens. Do you have any proof?  The author states that scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa when the face appeared. This shows that they have seen things like this before and they knew that it wasn't real, or alien like. Another example that the author proves is that Garvin said it reminded him of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. The camera on board MGS had to peer through wispy clouds to see the face and perhaps alien markings were hidden by haze. Also NASA can be hidding information about the Face. But, you can see that the Face is formed by shadows, and not an alien haze.  Contrary to popular belief, there is nothing unatural about the supposed \"Face on Mars\". Though many would like to believe in the supernatural, this oddity is nothing but a rock formation. There are several reasons as to why the theory of aliens making this formation is preposterous, each reason stronger than the previous.  The curiousity about Mars has been going on for centuries.  People say that there is or once was life on Mars, and now they are saying that there is a face on Mars.  Humans all around the world have questioned whether the \"Face\" was created by aliens or just a natural landform.  Some of the biggest tricks played are constructed by the eyes. When the first image of the face on Mars was revealed, the features such as the eyes and nose were most likely created by shadows. In the article it explains, \"A few days later NASA unveiled the image for all to see. The caption noted a 'huge rock formation...which resembles a human head...formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth.\"  In paragraph 12, Garvin said, \" It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about thye sane height as the Face on Mars.\" Jim Garvin is saying that these formations on Mars are very similar to the ones that we have here on Earth. He is also saying that there os no face on Mars. ",

We couold abolish it or keep it the way it is. Some say the electoral college is undemocratic and unfair to the voters and the candidates. But some say it is the best way to vote.  The voters are left with an unfair outcome at almost every election because of the Electoral Collage. The votes can either be very close or the people could miss Ads or campaigns for canidates, leaving the people with nothing and confusion all over. Even if you knew what elector you voted for, you cant necessarily pick who it is your voting for and your vote could possibly get confued giving you a bad outcome. Most elections are just slid by and are just based on what ever the Electoral College thinks should happen. So please abolish the Electoral College its is irrational and is not neccessary, let the people really have a fair chance.  In conclusion, we should abolish the Electoral College in order to encourage more people to vote and to stop a catastrophe that is bound to happen soon. Acorrding to a Gallup poll done in 2000, over 60% over the American people would rather have a popular vote. This just prooves that the Electoral College is unfair, outdated, and irrational.   The electoral college might not be the best potential method for presidential elections. It is, however, far more desirable for such a large country than popular vote. Popular vote would lead to neglecting many areas of the economy that are important, but do not have a presence in states with large populations. It would make elections more one sided for each state at the same time. The problems the opponents say abolishing it would fix, would be fixed without it, but doing so would create far more problems than it solved. It is also easy enough to fix the same problems without abolishing the electoral college.  In conculsion, \"It's offical: The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. The best arguments in favor of it are mostly aserations without much basis in reality\", according to Source 2.  I would like you to consider all the problems our nation is facing due to the Electoral College. I have stated two contentions of why you should abolish the Electoral College; First,the method of how its done is very bias and unfair and secondly, because the Electoral College is a \"Disaster Factor\" or  causes many disruptions in our country.  The Electoral College is not the best way to vote in our beautiful country. It can be decieving and confusing. Though it may have one or two advantages, the list of things that can go wrong with it are of plenty. It is unfair, and could turn nasty. It should be abolished. Make America more equal.     The writer states, \"The American people should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century; the system allows for much worse\" (Plumer).\u00a0 This disaster was not the first disaster to happen in the system.\u00a0 According to Plumer, the system has had much more effect and damage on the United States and this should not be repeated again.\u00a0 The writer also says, \"electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please\" (Plumer).\u00a0 This goes to show, not only is the electoral college unbeneficial, but they can be sneaky.\u00a0 The electoral college should be abolished because of the atrocious outcomes it is capable of doing to our government.  however, chaning to election by popular vote will cause mant disputes and it is not the right way to keep everyone satisfied with voting for a new president. Keeping the Electoral College is more realistic.  To start off, the electoral college is a system thats been around for ever but is getting outdated. I think that some people might want a different system while others prefer the same or dont care. For all we know,Bob Dole could be right about abolishing the electoral college. Or maybe it needs a new way of carrying the votes. ",

How would you like to be forced to commit to something you didn't want to do to start with? I'm pretty sure no one would want that. Though extracurricular activities are great for students to do, some are just reserved and are shy when having to do things in front of people. For students with anxiety, that is extremely embarrassing. Plus, if you force someone to do something they don't want to do, they'll just do it with half-effort and that makes everything one step harder for the people who actually wanted to do that activity. I can almost guarantee that this will happen if schools force students to do this, and it'll just make the activities less fun for the ones who actually want to do it.  for instance some people think that community service takes time and energy that they don't have it really makes it impossible for them to do anything.  If many people say to not do something then the person knows that majority of people agree it will only do them harm. It is the same for the things a person should do. If many people have the same advice then they know that it's the right thing to do. Indecisiveness is prevalent in many people. Having several voices present\u00a0should enforce the person to make a decision. Someone can also put together all of the advice they get and find the common denominator of the advice. Making the person self assured about following the advice people gave, because so many of their peers thought the same way. You can tweak all of the advice to create a better idea or a stronger piece of advice. Usually your own advice is best for yourself, so adding other people's advice to your own can help you make a greater choice.  This means that the more options you have, the easier it is to do the right thing. Others' opinions can stop you from doing the wrong thing. When they tell you their end it may impact you and stop you from doing something you wouldn't have wanted to do. Others' opinions can also show you what consequences there might be for your actions. They might tell you the possibilities of what might happen when you say that. People opinions can greatly impact what you do.  Instead of wanting to get in the car and drive to do something they could walk and get some excercise or even take a bike if they wanted to get there faster. Walking and biking are low intensity excercises making it easy for everyone to participate. Many overweight people always feel lathargic, getting out and walking or biking would also help them to feel better. Doing this would help our people and environtment become more heatlhy.  It's a rebellious stage of life when they think they can do whatever pleases them. So naturally if someone tells them that they absolutely must do something, they automatically think no way. If they have an attitude like this it will ruin the experience and they won't get the good feeling people do when you serve others. They might dislike it so much that they don't even do service when they're grown up. They resent people that tell them they have to do something, and then they are ornery towards everyone else afterwards.  That would make it partially impossible for you to do everyday and some people have split parents (divorced) which means they are already moving back and forth between them they don't need to be having to go to community service things at the community that they might not even be in at the time, it would screw up the schedules of the parents of the kids and it would put a lot of pressure on the kids to make sure they get it right every time they have to do it.  By choosing to not take a traditional school, an individual is able to focus more than just their academic life and able to take on more opportunites that most likely would not be given if it were not for this barrier. Also, attending classes online pushes a person on being more independent because it is ultimately all on them to juggle with their own academic and personal life. Although attending classes online might not be for everyone, it goes to show that there are many benefits one can take from it.  I don't, however, believe in forcing people to do something they don't have to do.  This may help students feel less overwhellmed however it will not prepare them for the rest of their schooling years because as previously stated the course work only gets harder and simplifying the work load will not do anything.

Making students be forced to stay after school would not work for students who play sports and have practice, or students who have to help support their families with a job. Having them be forced to do an activity would take away time from other things that they need to do, or things that they want to do.  This may happen because the student's parent could be busy. A lot of parents have to work late. They don't have suitable hours that will allow them to pick up or drop off their child at school. There have been countless times when students would stand outside waiting to be picked up from an after school activity. The students would stand outside for a long period of time. Standing outside without adult supervision can be dangerous for a student. A parent should not have to worry about getting his or her child home safely because the child was required to stay after school.  A frantic middle schooler had just received a load of homework from all of her teachers. Packets upon worksheets upon study guides that all needed to be done tonight. If she had to stay after school\u00a0there would be no time for chores that needed to be done and the homework. Children and parents have the right to choose if they would want to do after school. Not all parents and students would agree with having after school mandatory. Is having a madatory after school really benificial.  because students sometimes have issues at home were they cant stay after school for activities  Some students may want to go straight home from school to go eat and take a nap. Also when some students are testing all day they may want to go home and relax. However if the principal forces students to participate in extracurricular activities then they will be even more exhausted by staying after school for the clubs or sports. Some students may not want to stay at school for an extra 1 to 3 hours just for a extracurricular activity. students may have made plans to hang out with friends or go out to the mall. However if they are forced to stay after school then they would have to change their plans. This is another reason why the principal should not force students to participate in extracurricular activities.  Also some people need to call their legal guardian and ask them if they can stay after school, to study, do a project, or watch a sports game after school. Since the school won't let them call home and ask they either don't go or go and don't call home.  One reason they might not be able to do community service is because they might have a love one that is sick at home and they have to be there for there aid. Second reason is because a student might have financial problems at home were they may have to take on a part time job after school to help around the household with payments. The final reason is that student there self may have health issues forbidding them from doing any community service. Those are the reasons why a student may not be able to do community work after school because of personal issues.  they may not have time to stay after (jobs, other classes, homework, sports)  Students should be able to choose if they want to do after school. Some students have a lot of homework already that the teachers give out, so most students are spending a sunny day inside doing homework after a long day at school and a long after school\u00a0activity. Many students have stress and are overwhelmed by having too much homework and after school right after that. Most students have enough work that had to be done during school. Why push it so they have to stay longer and do more work than they should. Adding after school\u00a0to the schedule will make more busy parents frustrated because they are the ones who have to pick up their child. The after school schedules does not meet up with the parents schedule and it make everything chaotic and difficult.  We get tired because of all the stress and thinking we had to do all day. After a normal school day is over, kids are really tired and are exited to go home. We go to sleep late at night, and wake up relatively early, making it hard for us to get up, which makes us more tired than the average person. Making clubs required means that school will be extended. It is not reasonable to force the students to stay an additional few minutes to do more work. Even if the we are not tired from a school day, we still have loads of work to do after school. The same goes for the teachers. They don't want to teach kids for any longer. If the teachers have a bad day than it's even worse because they want to be alone. After their final teaching session is over, they have to do more work like grading test, projects, or homework. When school is over, I'm extremely exited to go home. I'm am sure that everyone else feels the same. If I had to stay in school for any longer, I wouldn't feel good when I come home. When I get home from the extra activity that I'm doing, I'll feel so drained and I won't be able to practice tennis, or focus on studying for a test. My English teacher, Generic_Name, says she is very tired from teaching all day. She thinks that there is no point in making kids more tired because they probably can't do their work correctly at home. With the tired students and teachers, there is no point in required extracurricular activities. ",

The team and kids are doing fine just the way it is and changing the grade average will make a big difference, and not in a good way. kids will stop trying out because there is just too much going on and they cant keep up. plus a C is a passing grade and students want to get a higher grade then that because its risky at a C itself. some kids are already struggling and raising the grade will just make it harder. Leave the average the way it is because i could guarantee you that it will not be a good idea. you don't know what kids have to do after school, or go through, and if the students and teachers and coaches are happy then what is the harm?  Students go above and beyond their usual school habits and they will have to study hard and work to get the B average.  They may be good at math but very bad at ELA. So if they get below a B average in that class they might get kicked off the team. Every person has his own abilities to do a certain thing or class. This is not fair to the people who are not good at everything. If they are not good at it that does not mean that they have to be kicked of the team.   Having a C average is still passing and that's what we should contemplate on, not a B average. If we eliminate the sport activity from the child it wont benefit them  First however, I believe some background knowledge is required. As you know already, a C grade average is considered average in most of our country, where as a B or an A average are considered above average, and outstanding, respectively. Also, as you may know already, most of the student body retains a C average. Your change in school policy would mean that everybody who is currently participating in school activities would be kicked out of them until new term grades come in at which point they may only hope that they did well enough to continue their sport. Our competitive would all fail do to the almost complete rooting of the students. Now this may only last a term, but who knows how long it might take to raise your grade average by a whole letter? You obviously went to school when you were a child, and I assume you enjoyed the extra curricular clubs which your school had to offer. Now imagine this. Imagine that you learned that you had to maintain an A or B average to continue in these sports. Now this was one of the years where you didn't do so well, and therefore got a C average. Wouldn't such a thing be detrimental to you? It would cause you to be kicked out of every activity which you participated in unless you managed to raise your grade! That is one the main points I am putting forth.  If a B average is the minimum for participation, then it may inspire students (who would otherwise just float by) to do their work, do it well, and bring home a nice progress report every few weeks.  If you change school policy and make it so that students can't participate in sports or other activities unless they have at least a B average, you are preventing students from being their best at what they do or in other words, being knowledgeable in their activity.  When considering whether or not to allow children to participate in sports or other activities without an average above a C, what one must remember is that everyone has their own strengths and weaknesses. Yes, many people excel in academics, but there are others, who math and science just don't click with them. By saying these more athletically inclined individuals cannot participate in their medium, you take away one of their great pleasures. Some kids get a rush when they find out they aced their midterm, but others take greater pleasure in scoring the winning touchdown or participating in a club where you help others.  This would probably only happen for a couple of years or sport seasons but after awhile everything would be back to normal and it would be just like anything else in the world and people would begin to grow to the B average rule that the principle has.  With a requirement of a B average to participate in extracurricular activities, more students would have the goal of achieving a B average.  As a result, less students would be failing their courses do to lack of effort or time.  With more students with a higher average, the school would look better in terms of grades.  Now that their is a requirement of a B average to participate in sports, music, or another activity, the school would have much smarter students.  As a result, these students would be sent to better colleges.  This would make the school less known for its bad things, but more well-known for its high academic prestige.  This requirement would be the most reasonable choice because less students would be failing courses.  ",

                "content": "Of course, people can argue that if a car were to drive itself, there would be less accidents. It is true that driverless cars could reduce accidents from drunk driving and other impaired states, or just simple driving errors.  If you were to buy a driver less car you would expect to relax during the car ride.  Less cars mean less greenhouse gas emissions, which inturn help our environment. It also leads to less stress and deaths among the people in the city. Less cars are the future of our world, and its not too late to start to help our environment and to help better ourselves.    \"Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe...and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States\", Rosenthal writes in \"In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars\". By driving less, we can reduce our greenhouse gas emissions. \"Paris bans driving due to smog,\" by Robert Duffer, is a prime example of the reduction of air pollution after limiting car usage. \"After days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city\", writes Duffer. One Friday, the smog of Paris \"rivaled Beijing, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world\". On the following Monday, motorists with even-numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a $31 fine. After only one day with less cars on the roads, the smog had nearly dissappeared. This shows that even a day with less cars can make a huge difference in the amount of air pollution. Rosenthal's article, \" The End of Car Culture\", states that many sociologists believe that if the pattern of less cars continues, \"it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment\" because transortation is America's second largest sourse of carbon emissions. Less air polution is a very important advantage of less cars.   The United States is also seeing a change in the amount of people that are buying fewer cars and driving less. These kinds of trends will ultimatly benefit the society if continued, by limiting carbon emissions.  Thousands of car related accidents happen every minute around the world in automobiles. If everyone started walking, biking, or using pubilc transportation less cars would be on the road leading to less accidents. Families lose loved ones everyday just because the driver of the car isnt paying attention  Limiting the usage of cars has personal and professional support all across the globe and yet it has yet to be embraced everywhere. Statistical proof show where it may help and real life examples of some of the effects of reducing, or getting rid of altogether, cars in one's daily life. While \"recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by\" (Source 4), is that really enough or for the right reason? There are plenty of reasons to stop, or limit, the amount of cars being driven on the roads for every kind of person, from the hippie to the businessman, from the mom to the college student.  The driverless cars that Google cofounder Sergey Brin foresees would use half the fuel we use today. Fossil fuels are becoming an issue, but what if we had one less use for them? Without the need for so much fuel that wouldn't be so much of an issue anymore, and we would have more time to plan for whenever the time may be that we run out of fossil fuels. Also, if we perfected the driverless car there will be a lot less crashes. Without so many crashes we wouldn't be paying for repairs as often. We also wouldn't pay for the medical bills and such associated with an automobile accident.  Cars, both the rose and the thorns in a community and enviroment, can be both benificial and harmful to people, depending on who you are. For most regular pedeastrians and citizens within a city, less cars means less pollution, traffic, and stress. Unless you are a business owner of a car dealership or working for a delivery company, limited car usage means very postive things for social relationships, health, the enviroment, and general living conditions of a busy city. The less harmful emissions of gases from cars could greatly affect the outcome of our clean, energy efficient future.       \u00a0     a life without cars might be a life worth living since it contributes to a stress-free society, a healthy environment, and an acceptance of other means of transportation. By relying less on cars, people can eliminate the variety of negative impacts on the world. The Earth can become a happier, cleaner, and more accepting place with a dead engine.    ",

If our president was chosen by popular vote, then he would visit all of the states, trying to win them over. However, there are some strong arguments against this. To begin with, one man would have to visit 50 states, and even if he only visited the majority, there is still a posibility that the state will not vote for him anyways, in the end. If we keep the Electoral College, then the majority of votes in a state would count, not his popularity. As a fourteen year old, I can relate this to highschool. A student can be the most popular student in the school, but they can also be the most rude and mean. And while another student may not be popular, they can be the nicest in the school. If the president was chosen by a popular vote, he might just end up being the worst thing that could happen to the country.  Since most of the big states already have their votes planned out on who is going to win them over, president-to-be's don't try to persuade them because they know they have those votes. Mostly they try to change the swing states, or the smaller states because they could change from Democratic to Republican during anytime in the election. If everyone had a say in the election, more people would be inclined to vote and there would be more input into who became the next 4 year leader of this nation.  Bradford Plummer believes that one of the most worrying thoughts is that there will be a tie with the electors. If that were to occur the elction would fall into the hands of the House of Representitives, resulting in all the states, no matter what their population is, having the same amount of votes, casuing a president that may be very far away than what the majority of the United States actually wants. This may seem unlikely but in fact there have already been many close calls. In 1968, only 41,971 votes would have deadlockes the election. In 1976 a tie would have happened if 5,559 voters in Hawaii, and 3,687 voters in Hawaii had voted the other way (The Indefensibel Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong, by Bradofrd Plummer.) A tie may occur and if it does, A lot of citizens would be very upset that the president did not win by popularity, but by the Electoral College.  For example, many young voters base their votes off of popular opinion, not what they think is actually right. If there was no Electoral College, the Nation could be in a lot of trouble because many votes would be casted off of popular opinion. So it is good to have some control over what happens and who becomes president, but I think having the full decision to vote for whomever, and have it count, is overdoing it.  According to the Gallup pole in the 2,000, taken shortly after Al Gore, thanks to the quirks of the electoral college, won the popluar vote but lost the presidency. Over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now. This is what im talking about people. People are losing their elections due to the electoral college. One of the major reasons of why people are wanting a change, there should be no electoral college, only a popular vote for the election. We all want a better Government. I only there was a better way to vote.  Change needs to happen and it has to soon. If not, a poor president could be elected and then who knows what bad things could happen? With the popular vote, more people will be heard, and they will better take part in their country's government, leading to a better nation.       \u00a0  Most states have a \"winner-takes-all\" system (with the exception ofMaine and Nebraska) that awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate in their state.(source 1) There may be an arguement that no state has enough votes to give the presidency to someone; however, this system basically casts away the other votes of those on the side of the opposing candidate, making it undemocratic. Besides that, there is also the chance that a few of the electors go rouge and vote for the opposing candidate.  It would then go to the House of Representatives, who might not even have the want of the people in mind. Since most of the time Congress has a party that makes up a majority of it, it would be very unfair to allow them to pick the president. It's also possible that even if a majority of the people vote for a president, the electoral votes elect the other candidate instead, like what happened to Al Gore in 2000. An election like this just has too many holes and pitfalls to be efficient. The holes need to be repaired before we can actually use this as our primary way to select a president, or else we're setting ourselves up to have problems in the future.  Here is a prime example, in the 2000 election Al Gore won the popular vote but because he had less electoral votes than Bush he unfourtunetly lost the election. According to Bradford Plumer \"over 60% of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now.\" It seems rather logical that if somebody gains the most votes in an election that the country would prefer that canidate to be the president. For that reason alone the reader should side with the idea to abolish the electoral college. Now besides somebody receiving more or less electoral votes, perhaps the candidates tied. In this case it gets thrown to the House Of Representitives which will cause a Wyoming Rep. with 500,000 voters to have just as much say as a California Rep. with 35,000,000 voters. All a tie would do is corrupt the voting system even more than it is. For those reasons there should be an indefinite ban on the electoral college.  In paragraph nine,\u00a0 the text says, \"... according to a Gallup poll in 2000, taken shortly after Al Gore- thanks to the quirks of the electoral college- won the popular vote but lost presidency, over 60 percent of voters\u00a0 would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now.\" The electoral college is responsible for picking electors, who can go behind the peoples back and chose the president nobody wanted. This system or process is a total disaster. Paragraph thirteen states, \"At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winner-take-all system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the 'swing' states. ",

If the president was chosen by a popular vote, he might just end up being the worst thing that could happen to the country.  In an election their really is a process of voting and voting again. Instead of couting the number of people who want a certain president and so on. We are viewed as a state and some states having more say than other even if the votes are in the same margin. This is the reason why some states are focused on more by the candidates and are heavily educated on the topic and given more attention than smaller states whose votes wont change much. an even bigger problem is te fact that most states operate on a winner-take-all basis so even a slight majority vote one way will give that person all of the votes. A very worrying prospect as expressed in source two is the possibility of a tie. in which the election would be given to the house of representatives. Each state only gets on vote so a representative representing 500,000 people would have as much say as representatives representing 35 million people.  It would then go to the House of Representatives, who might not even have the want of the people in mind. Since most of the time Congress has a party that makes up a majority of it, it would be very unfair to allow them to pick the president.

The holes need to be repaired before we can actually use this as our primary way to select a president, or else we're setting ourselves up to have problems in the future.  After all, electoral colleges should be changed because it is better for the people so there is more of an input from smaller populated states, they will want to vote and there would be less of an ability to tie the election. Having a popular vote lets the citizens in big states that are metaphorically already \"chosen\" allows the minority vote to maybe have a chance in the office. Last but not least, it is understood that having the electoral college decreases wrong-doings, but if the elector chosen by the state changes his intentions just for himself, that gives the state no word about it.     because if a voter has voted for example Obama for the electoral vote but voted for Romney for the popular vote it would be unorganized because of the split vote between popular and electoral which is recquired the majority of when in a public govermental election which could impact the whole future for the nation. The election for Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992 they both had only a 43 percentage plurality of popular votes while also winning a majority in the electoral college which was (301 and 370 electoral votes) . When no candidate fully wins the majority of the votes that were casted they wouldn't have to recount the votes of have a re-election which would drain the economies money because of the high amount of money put into one election in the first place just to have another election, whereas the electoral college can just step in and rectify the situation just by producing a clear winner on their own instead of going through a long process just to find out who the clear winner is all they have to do is debate among themselves who they believe the people would be happy with in the long run .   This nation is a nation of freedom and peace. Not for a bunch of people who are power hungry. The Electoral College is fair and equal, it is the government that is not. If the government would only change for the better then there would be no problem. This nation is still young compared to all the other countries. They have gotten all there issues taken care of, but we have not. The reason is that some of the officials are power hungry and do things to take care of themselves and not others, but some are not and they want to make this country better. Those are the ones that should stay and not the power hungry ones. They make it fair. So I strongly belive that the Electoral College should stay the same, and that the government should be the one to change.  If there ever is a deadlock in the campiagn the voting will have to go to the house which will be mostly filled with the majority side. So the minority won' have much of a chance.\" Because almost all states award electoral votes on a winner-take-all basis, even a very slight plurality in a state creates a landslide electoral-vote victory in that state.\" (source 3) that means a close election isn't so close anymore because of Electoral vote. But some people will say u can never get a tie. \" A tie in the nationwide electoral vote is possible because the total number of votes-538- is an even number.\"(source 3)  Bradford Plummer believes that one of the most worrying thoughts is that there will be a tie with the electors. If that were to occur the elction would fall into the hands of the House of Representitives, resulting in all the states, no matter what their population is, having the same amount of votes, casuing a president that may be very far away than what the majority of the United States actually wants.

A tie may occur and if it does, A lot of citizens would be very upset that the president did not win by popularity, but by the Electoral College.  A tie is almost impossible in that circumstance also, because what are the chances out of millions of citizens the number would be perfectly split in half. If a president appeals for a region, then\u00a0 let them vote for who they believe is the better candidate. At the end of the day, the majority wins. Swing states won't have to be a factor without the Electoral College, and big states are just counted them same, one point per vote. Run-off elections won't be necessary if the highest percentage president wins, even if its not majority.  If you elect a good representive that you belive, and trust that will vote to your liking. Someone that would not turn his back on the will of the people then it would not be that bad. The process they go throught maybe difficult and hard to understand. So it could be a good thing they take the hard work off our backs and do it for us to save us the time and hardwork. The Electoral Colleges requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal rather then a single region appeal. ",

Keep in mind that when the electoral college was made, many citizens had no idea who had won often until the next year. The fact that we know immediatly is proof that the meeting of the Electoral college in December is completely unnessessary. And what if there is a tie in the elctoral vote, although we know what the popular vote is, we would still have to send the vote to congress.  To sum it all up, the Electoral college is just an unnecassary back up plan when there is not one needed. It is unfair to the citizens and the candidate's electors are unreliable. If there was a way to keep the Electoral College, it would only be for ties. It wouldnt be needed if the vote was a clean win. When the President Election comes in the next 3 years, I hope that you consider my thoughts, because there are plenty people out there with the same perspective.     In conclusion,\u00a0 the state senators should eliminate the electoral collge because they count the majorty votes, and don't count other votes that is not popular as the other candidates vote. also because they can decide vote on an canditate they want based on their opinions and beliefs. and lastly because of the winner takes it all system which is bascially taking the losing candidates electoral votes.     The electoral college allowed some of are greatest presidents to win beacuse if they got more electoral votes then popular vote it would'nt matter they will still win. The electoral college also avoids the problem of one candidate not recieving the majority of the votes cast. The electoral college has been in are country for so long and has worked for us well but I still believe that the popular vote can be and\u00a0 should be used in future elections  In conclusion, the Electoral College and its electors must be disbanded so that popular vote will be used in determining the new president of the United States. According to both Source 2 and 3, the process of voting a group of people to vote for you is un-democratic. Electors, the people making up th Electoral College, can be manipulated and coerced into voting a specific candidate. Lastly, non-swing states will be ignored; this will anger and frustrate them since not one candidate tried to persuade them. Florida State Senator, you must, in the best of your ability and then some, try to topple down the un-democratic roots of the Electoral College. The people, the ones who must truly decide on the president, will be immensely greatful towards you; in a 2000 poll, 60% of the voters even stated that they want a popular-vote type of election.  in our day and time we have smart phones and aindroids that we can use to vote for the president in the peoples choice. there could be a web site that you can go on to submit your election and at the end of the election the compuster can tally us the number of votes to the exact amount so it would be the peoples choice. its\u00a0 also outdated becouse we dont need one or a few guys to be sent somewhere to cast the vote of the people , we have so mmusch advanced technology that we can have any legal person who wants to vote can and actually have there vote matter insted of what the elector pick so it matters to those few poeple instead of every single person in america.  In conclusion, the Electoral College is very important to our modern day elections. The citizens and the states determine who the next Presidents will be. The process provides successful elecions which are fair and equal to not only the people, but the states. Posner states, \"Voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a poltiacl preference rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election\" (Posner 1). The Electoral College makes sure that every person and state vote is accounted for and will be contributed to who the next President will be. One day maybe there will be a process that will exceed the Electral College, but for now, we will trust our founding fathers and keep the process that has been with us since the start.\u00a0        As a student I want the best for the up coming generations, including me, that are going to be able to be a part of the presidential elections and to not be confused who to vote for or how the electoral college works. Every year a new generation becomes legal to vote and be part of the election but if they dont know how to vote or how it works then they wont be able to. Some people dont know anything about poitics but, still want to be able to vote so, it should be easy for them to vote for who they want to be president rather then the long process of, voting for the canidates elector and most of the time they dont vote for who they want and they vote for the wrong person.       \u00a0 ",

                "content": "Transportation is the second largest source of America's emmisions and is responsible for fifty percent of greenhouse gas emissions in the United States but is slowly making a change towards helping the enviornment and being beneficial towards carbon emissions. In 2005, the number of miles driven in the United States was at it's highest rate. As time went by, the numbers started dropping and getting lower. Many sociologits believe that if the numbers get even lower and stay at that rate, the benefits will come for the enviornment but unfortunetly not for car companys. Paris typically has more smog than any other European capital and is working towards a way to fix that. Paris banned driving due to the intensity and abundance of the smog in their city and had people use public transportation free of charge for about a week. Not using motor vehicles for those days really did help the situation of Paris and gave people an insight as to how life would be without cars.  As stated in the \"Driverless Cars Are Coming\" article, Google cofounder Sergey Brin believes that his idea of a driverless car public transport system would use half the feul as today's taxis. As our feul is a fossil feul, meaning one day it will run out, using as little of it as possible is much more than just a good thing. Also, using this idea of a driverless car public transport system would save us a lot of money. Not having to drive your own car and fill it up every week would save you quite a bit on gas money. Also, you would not have to pay for repairs or damages to your vehicle.  This can be evidenced by my own experience. One time, I had to decide what to get with money I had received for my birthday. I knew I wanted clothes, but I could not decide which kind. I believed it would always be practical to buy uniforms for school. However, my friends suggested I purchased clothing such as merchandise, sportswear, accessories, even things that were not clothes! All of these suggestions baffled me at first, but then i realized they were actually fantastic ideas! Ultimately, I decided to compare every suggestion I received and decide what to spend my money on based off of that. I realized that buying uniforms would be a bit of a waste and that I already had plenty, whereas there was a bit of a dearth when it came to clothes I actually enjoyed wearing. Without my friends, I never would have realized that! Ultimately, I ended up purchasing whatever clothes made me happy, such as those I found aesthetically pleasing and those that reminded me of things I enjoy. Despite thinking it was impractical at first, I am still very pleased with my choice and I never would have made it without the consultation I got from others.  Smog in Paris, France and Bogota, Columbia have reached record pollutions and both cities do not want to deal with it any longer. Robert Duffer writes about how the Paris government enforced a new rule which allowed both even and odd numbered license plates to drive on a certain day and would alternate everyday. This was very beneficial, however some people needed transportation but would be fined $31 if their car was used on the wrong day. Being that Paris is one of the most famous capitals of the world, one would expect to see more smog than usual. Andrew Selsky also writes that in Bogota, Columbia, a day without cars was put into place in the 1990's and still continues today. Once a year, buses and taxis are the only transportation allowed in the whole city. If not obeyed, there would be a $25 fine. This day was put into place as an improvement campaign which also benefitted the city. Bike paths and smooth sidewalks were put in and during rush hour has cut the traffic in half. It also opened up restaurants and shopping malls which were widely used by the public.  my belief is that America needs to evolve. The people are in need of better public transportation and infrastructure. If we can create vehicles that can transport people at high speed and wove our transportation issues in America. We can pay for it and create with the help of tax payer dollars and companies willing to work with the government. If we follow the basic outline put forward and expand upon it we can achieve many things and creat many things the people of America and the world need.  countries all over the world are trying to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and smog. Paraguay, France, Colombia, and even America is trying to get people to use different types of transportation and reduce smog. So citizens all over the world should just for one day not use a car. One person can start a revolution for their community, city, or state. If everyone all over the world could do this we would reduce tons of greenhouse gases amd smog. We can make earth a better place and more healthy enviroment.       \u00a0       \u00a0   Driverless cars are coming in the future. In the future, no one will probably need to buy cars because they won't need them. According to Google cofounder Sergey Brin, that will happen. He sees a future with a public transportation system where fleets of driverless cars form a public- transport taxi system. The cars he foresees would use half the fuel of today's taxis and offer far more flexibility than a bus. There are many great things about driveless cars, but there are some bad things as well.   In other societies where limitations of car usage occured, the majority of its denizens replied positively. In the car-depleted suburb of Vauban, Germany, \"57 percent sold a car to move [to Vauban]\" (Source 1). The influential idea of a suburb without traffic jams and long drives to stores attracted 5,500 current residents of Vauban. Futhermore, car bans in Paris reduced emissions and cleansed the air \"after days of near-record pollution\" (Source 2) and \"five-days of intensifying smog\" (Source 2). During this ban, \"congestion was down 60 percent\" (Source 2), relieving traffic and pollution. In Bogota, Colombia, a \"car-free day\" (Source 3) promotes \"alternative transportation and reduce[s] smog\" (Source 3). One Colombian businessman commented cheerfuly, \"It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution.\" (Source 3)  few people will be buying gas or diesel fuel for their cars. Elisabeth Rosenthal tells her audience that Vauban, Germany has an upscale community where nearly everyone has given up their cars. Here, people sold their cars just so that they could buy a house in peace without having to hear traffic jams and honking horns all the time. Many say that this environment makes them happier because it is so peaceful. 70% of the community do nott own cars and the ones that do must leave it in a large parking garage outside the developement\u00a0 that is purchased with the home. In another article, also written by Elisabeth Rosenthal, discusses America and the recent\u00a0 decrease of the amount of driven by a single person. Research shows that the amount driven in 1995 is about the same as the amount driven in 2013. This is due to environmental protectionists who walk evrywhere they go and due to the dangers of driving. There are fewer young adults driving today as well; in eight years, the amount has decreased 23%  For one, the necessity to have to buy or pay off a car would essentially cease to exist. If computer-operated vehicles were capable of driving in all areas, then what would the need for having your own car be? Even if the car wasn't \"fully automated\" and the driver would have to take over at some point, the less work you have to do, the more time you have to work on something else. The article addresses this topic \"Some manufacturers hope to do that by bringing in-car entertainment and information systems that use heads-up displays.\" The biggest asset that the consumer gains from a driverless car is time, while still being transported in a safe and reliable vehicle. This reinforces the advantages available to consumers who use a driverless car.  ",

The author uses strong details to support this claim throughout the article. Facts and statistics by NASA and other reliable sources are used to back the claims. The author stands by the opinion that Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents.  In conclusion, the author of \"The Challenge of Exploring Venus\" demonstrates how despite the dangers Venus presents, it is worthy of pursuing. Exploring venus seems like it is almost impossible with all the risks it offers, but the author makes it clear in this article that they disagree. Their use of evidence in their writing to support their belief that Venus is a worthy pursuit shows how well researched their case is. The author used evidence on Venus's relationship to Earth, how landing on Venus is possible, and the natural curiosity humans have to support their idea. After taking a look at this article, readers know that the points made in \"The Challenge of Exploring Venus\" were very nicely supported. The author's support made their idea a thought provoking case.  In \"The Challenge of Exploring Venus,\" the author provides a compelling and efficient argument to support the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers. Using statistics, factual information, and specific plans being developed as we speak, the author convinces the audience that exploring Venus is worth the risks involved.  In the article, \"The Challenge of Exploring Venus,\" the author thinks studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers, but does not support this idea very well.  Studying Venus seems almost impossible with all the risks, but the author of \"The Challenge of Exploring Venus\" suggests that Venus is a worthy pursuit despite all the dangers it presents.  In \"The Challenge of Exploring Venus,\" the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents is supported through Venus' vast similarities to Earth, Venus' proximity to Earth, and the innovation in machines by researchers that could make them work long enough to expand mankind's knowledge on Venus. The idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers is supported through Venus' vast similarites to Earth, which is why humans have such interest in this particular planet. The idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the presented dangers is conveyed through Venus' proximity. The idea that Venus is a worthy pursuit despite its hostile environment is supported through the innovation in machines that could make the close-up exploration of Venus possible. The author believes that sometimes humans cannot let curiosity, imagination, and innovation be trampled by the dangers and doubts. Humans cannot live in fear all the time. The human spirit always demands that humans continue striving towards knowing more.    Clearly, the author has efficiently and convincingly supported the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. By describing all the information about the existence of other life forms and the similarities to Earth that we could potentially learn from the study, the author proves how worthy Venus is to be discovered. The author also rebuttals one of the main concerns for traveling to the planet by explaining how plans are being developed to make travel and living conditions surviveable, safe, and efficient for both humans and machines. In \"The Challenge of Exploring Venus,\" the author was able to convey and support the idea that Venus is worthy of exploration.  Throughout the article, it suggests that studying Venus is still a worthy mission for astronomers, however, the dangers that come along with these missions are extremely dangerous and life-threatening. The author mentions the curiosity that scientists have involving Earth's sister planet, and the desire to still visit Venus regardless of the harsh conditions. With the article's use of both previous experiences of missions and spacecrafts, as well as shocking factual statistics of Venus, the claim is very strongly supported with evidence.   In \"The Challenge of Exploring Venus,\" the author supports the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents  The author of this article supports the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers by stating the insight to be gained from further exploring Venus and by presenting new methods that are making new insights possible. The danger of Venus is extensive due to the high temperatures, extreme atmospheric pressure, and wild weather patterns. These obstacles are being dealt with though by new ideas from scientists at NASA. One big idea from NASA is the idea to use a blimp to observe Venus from above the surface. Another idea of theirs is to use materials that would be able to withstand the extreme conditions of the Venusian environment. All this is in the hopes that futher insight will be made on the planet that once was the most Earth-like planet in the solar system. ",

Now, it is only fair to say that everyone has a different and unique way of learning, whether it be through hands on activities, trial and error, or just being told what to do. The demand for these needs is high due to the rising population in public schools, and not every student's needs can be met at all times. Some of the students may struggle based on how the curriculum is taught in one class, and excel in another one taught differently. It all depends on how each student receives information the best. Certain educational centers provide distance learning, which provides students with the opportunity to complete their studies and courses online. The courses offer students the chance to have video conferences, independent learning, and many more things that are made for the single purpose of ensuring education.  it takes out our free time which gives us time to have fun and learn new things  you can learn a lot from others,  A teacher who knows their students can better tailor the lessons to them based on their learning styles and needs. For example, a teacher could dedicate more time in class to review logarithmic functions with games or act out  Romeo and Juliet to help the students better understand the concepts. Activities such as these that are beneficial to students are not possible through distance learning, and could harm a student's level of understanding about a topic. Additionally, it is harder for students to get help when they do not understand new material or need clarification through distance learning. Traditionally, students can ask their teachers questions, visit their teachers during their office hours or study hall, or meet with a peer tutor. For distance learning, a student would have to video call or email their teacher, but it is much harder to explain or understand concepts without being able to meet in person.  We all want to make the right choice when we come across a problem. The only way to do this is to ask multiple people for advice. Asking more than one individual helps us know the options, stay away from bias, and learn from others' past experiences. Once we do this, it is our turn to choose what is the best choice.\u00a0  you can learn form their experiences,  they might find out more information on the situation.   Secondly, we should continue studying Venus because it will allow us to learn more about Venus and the planet's harsh conditions.  If you hear multiple pieces of advice, you can learn new things,  Venus is not worth the time, effort and resources to explore. The planet proves to be too dangerous for mankind and even for machines. Curiosity is not sufficiant enough of a reason to explore and learn about a inhospitable planet unless it is going to benefit mankind more than what it costed to gain that information. The resources that are going to Venus should be redirected to another cause that will benefit society and life as we know it. ",

                "content": "Every living thing on planet earth has emotions. These emotions have been used since the beginning of time to express the feelings of the people around you. However, these emotions can be decieving. Someone could say they are happy, when really they are angry or upset. This is where the Facial Action Coding System comes into play. The FACS is a software that detects human emotion by tracking muscles in the face. For example, when you are happy, muscles in your face move up, and when you are sad, they move down, FACS tracks this and calculates your emotions. The creators of this software, Prof. Thomas Huang and Prof. Nicu Sebe are the leading experts of developing better ways for humans and computers to communicate. There are still some questions surrounding the usefulness of FACS, like what could this software actually be used for? One of the ways FACS may be used is in classrooms.  simply talking to more people can get more of the nerves and bad emotions out.  We as humans can not let fear stand in our way and give up on our evolutionary duty because we are afraid that someone else will hurt us for it.  It is very easy to cross someone's boundaries and get in trouble in the blink of an eye. This could happen frequently if you only have one opinion from one source or person.  The trusted person helping you can show you how the other person might be feeling. Sometimes knowing how they feel can change your point of view on things. The friend or family member can inform you on what you did wrong. Even if the opposing person hurt your feelings, there is a high chance you have hurt them as well! If you are confused on what the problem is they can show you what it is or how it started. For me, I need to understand how the problem started before I resolve it. Understanding how the other person felt, knowing what the problem is, and realizing what you did wrong are important things the trusted people helping you can do for you to make a better choice.   Imagine being convinced that completing a certain task is worth any strugles along the way, and you end up severely hurt because of it. That is exaclty what the author of this article is trying to do.  Humans can often acknowledge how they are feeling, but the acknowledgement itself does not allow them to feel better. As stated in the article, \"They even indicate the difference between a genuine smile and a forced one\" (D'Alto 7). This line states that the lab partner will be able to tell a difference netween a genuine and meaningful smile from a harshly forced smile. There is a difference between the two because smiling will not make you happy although it is a happy gesture. The machine informing someone that they need to smile will not actually change the emotions of that person. Politicians and celebrities are major culprits of this action. They often smile as they are told to do, but they are not always genuine. They are typically hiding something from their spectators such as when they are not being truthful (D'Alto 8). Just because famous people smile when talking or looking at their audience does not change whether or not they are happy individuals. If humans themselves are unable to change their emotions when they can detect that something is wrong, then machines will be unable to do that also. Although it can give people a precise measurement of their emotions, it will not change how they feel. Therefore, investing in this system would be extremely useless and wasteful.  We all know where there are friends, there are foes. When you group a bunch of developing teenagers going through puberty, where emotions and hormones are swarming around, you get a sort of cesspool of emotion. Yes, at times there will be drama, fights, gossip, harassment, and many other things normal to the life of every day teens. Some may say this is a lie, but it is very well the cold hard truth. People won't always get along it's apart of the human nature, and as you're growing up you are still trying to figure out what you do or don't get along with.  A picture, song, video, etc. is not worth you getting yourself hurt or hurting someone else is not worth or even making some have a bad because you made them get stuck in traffic. Maybe you didn't even hurt yourself but you did hurt someone else just because you're ok doesn't mean you couldn't have hurt someone else bad. You need to get use to not having the urge to pull out your phone every time you get a notification. If you an emergency and you just have to use your phone pull over and park somewhere just don't pull it out and think you can multitask we you know you got to pay 100% attention to the road.          we all know how worried everyone is about getting in a car accident, or being\u00a0hit by a car, or getting 'T-boned.\" ",

Why does it do this? This technology can give us a valid reason to talk about the science of emotion more, and we can learn more about this as students or even as teachers.  It is no secret that many students dread coming to school, whether it be from stress, bullying, or simply not understanding the subjects. This system can pick up on a fake emotion, the author explains how it can read a \"fake smile\" and that to them \"faces don't lie\" (para. 8). If this system is able to sense when a student is unhappy or angry, this could be used as an advantage in helping the student. Not only this, but the author explains that \"moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions, but may even help produce them\" (para. 9). Taking both of these statements into account, and allowing them to be incorporated into the classroom, students may enjoy attending school and learning new things.  Emotion is in the brain, not the heart. The way the FACS understands emoion is simple. It maps out a 3-D model of the face, looks at the shape and positoin of all the muscles, then it associates the different facial movements with differet emotion. For example, your orbicularis oris (muscles around your mouth) tighten your lips to show when you are angry. It even works when a person it trying to mask emotions. During a fake smile, the zygomatic major stretches the mouth sidways, while in a real smile the zygomatic major lifts the corners of the mouth. These examples can show how science IS able to understand emotoin, probaly better than most humans. Arguments that use that falshood, that science is unable to understand emotion, is completly false.  The article states that the technology associates each emotion with \"characteristic movements of the facial muscles\" and then uses those movements to calculate the spectrum of emotions based on their facial display. But some people show emotions in various ways, and the technology most likely cannot accomodate for the many different ways people express the same emotion. For example, if a student has a resting face that seems generally happy, the system might confuse this dazed face as a satisfied face and think that the student is happy with their lessons when they are actually confused or not paying attention. In the same way, if a student has a resting face that looks naturally sad, the system may think they are unhappy with their lessons, even if the student feels they are learning a lot. A lot of students also try to hide their emotions, like frusteration or sadness, with a happier look on their face, and even though the article states that the system can detect a \"false smile\", it cannot always be accurate as a person may be good at hiding their emotions and displaying a genuine smile. Therefore, since technology is not always accurate and because human beings are so various in the way they behave, the technology would not be useful in a classroom where it may misread a student's state of mind and lead them in the wrong path of education.  In the third passage of the artice, the author states, \"Eckman has classified six basic emotions-happiness ... and then associated each with charactersitic movements of the facial muscles,\" meaning that the software associated voluntary or involuntary movements of the face with emotions. The problem with this system is that students can change the look of their face quite easily, and can thus convince the computer to produce desired results, making the system disfunctional. There are quite a few reasons children, especially young ones, would want to make the software not work, including tricking the computer into moving from the original learning program into a more desired one and them simply wanting to see the program fail through their abilities.  It can read a total of six emotions with some branches coming off of those emotions. The six emotions are stated in the quote,\" Eckman has classified six basic emotions - happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness - and then associated each with characteristic movements of the facial muscles.\" The machine is able to determine whether a student is in distress or not thus telling the teacher to help the student out with the problem that they are facing. The teacher would be able to help the student cope and deal with their emotional sadness or anger and tell them how to deal with it in order to assist them in getting through it. This is not the end though of what this incredible machine can do for a school.  According to the article \"Making Mona Lisa Smile,\" there is a new technology called the Facial Action Coding System (FACS) that enables computers to identify human emotions. This technology is relatively brand new. It creates a 3-D computer model of all fourty-four major muscles in the face that move like human muscles as well. Then, psychologists have classified six basic emotions that are associated with different movements in the facial mucles. This new technology could result in many benefits in our community as well as all around the world  Every living thing on planet earth has emotions. These emotions have been used since the beginning of time to express the feelings of the people around you. However, these emotions can be decieving. Someone could say they are happy, when really they are angry or upset. This is where the Facial Action Coding System comes into play. The FACS is a software that detects human emotion by tracking muscles in the face. For example, when you are happy, muscles in your face move up, and when you are sad, they move down, FACS tracks this and calculates your emotions. The creators of this software, Prof. Thomas Huang and Prof. Nicu Sebe are the leading experts of developing better ways for humans and computers to communicate. There are still some questions surrounding the usefulness of FACS, like what could this software actually be used for? One of the ways FACS may be used is in classrooms.  The human body has way more than just six emotions so getting a high accuracy reading on how you are really feeling is out of the question because FACS uses the a process of a 3-D model Dr. Huang states \"The process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D model of the face; all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles.\" This quote explains that it has to use a way of making a model which can sometimes take some time depending on the processing power of the computer not only that but human emotions can change quite quickly and if the pc doesnt make the model fast enough the computer can easly fail at getting and accuarate reading.  Lastly, students facial expressions may not directly correlate with the emotion they are feeling towards the lesson that they are learning. ",

                "content": "Sometimes people are busy all the time, like, people that do sports after school, some of them don't get out of there sports practice or games after sometime, mostly around 9:00pm. Personally, people are great for doing after school activities, but I'm not one of those people, and I will never be, unless its something with basketball, or an activity that I'd want to do on my free time, but it usually waists a lot of free time, and I'm one of those people that like to do homework, especially since I get a lot of it. So what I'm trying to say is, we have a life too, were not always just on our technology 24/7, were actually trying to do things that are good for us.  If we take an extra course, there might not be enough time to finish all our homework. When I get home, I have a substantial amount of homework to do, and I have to practice the sports I play. My schedule is already full. homework takes me the longest to do. I work on my homework thoroughly. I try to make sure there isn't any mistakes. When I do this, I'm more likely to pass the test because of how much thought and time I have put into my work. I describe this as my work ethic. My homework takes me about two to four hours at most and it takes up most of my schedule. The sports that I play take two hours. With a total of seven hours at most, I can never seem to fit anything else in my schedule. This might be surprising for other people but this is the daily schedule for average students and most students might have more to do. If we even tried to do an extra activity than we wouldn't be able to finish all of our work efficiently and properly. Adding another thing to do every day would throw off our work ethic and our grades would most likely go down. Time has such a drastic effect on us students because it can be hard to manage. Our parents, for example, suffer from time management along with us. If we all do an extra activity, then that means that school is extended another few minutes. This is hard for our parents who pick us up after school. They have to find another time to pick us up which can be stressful since their schedule is as cramp as ours. We are not able to participate in an extra curriculum because of the amount of time that we don't have, and even if we were able to, there might not be any other options.  there is no need to change the grade average to a B. There is no point to it. The team and kids are doing fine just the way it is and changing the grade average will make a big difference, and not in a good way. kids will stop trying out because there is just too much going on and they cant keep up. plus a C is a passing grade and students want to get a higher grade then that because its risky at a C itself. some kids are already struggling and raising the grade will just make it harder. Leave the average the way it is because i could guarantee you that it will not be a good idea. you don't know what kids have to do after school, or go through, and if the students and teachers and coaches are happy then what is the harm?  Some of my friends go home and do nothing after school. It can get boring to have nothing to do for the remainder of the day. Participating in an after-school activity can pass time and help you to not be bored, especially if you are participating in an activity you enjoy. When I was in elementary school, I went to an after-school art club so I could pass the time doing something that I liked. I also did after-school soccer in the fourth grade, and I started playing volleyball in the fourth grade. I am still playing volleyball to this day. These kinds of activities can give you something to do instead of going on your phone and doing nothing. I have gotten more productive over the past couple of years because I participate in extracurricular activities. I believe that kids can be more productive, and extracurricular activities are a vital way to achieve this goal. Not only is it a good way to spend your time, but it is also a good way to meet people.   Since you've asked all of these people you should be able to confidently make a good choice that will benefit you. Going into something like a job or a try out is optimal for success. All in all more opinions makes a stronger and more sound conclusion to the problem at hand.  An example of this from my past experience would be when I tried out for junior varsity softball at Generic_School. I wasnt sure if trying out was gonna benefit me at all considering i'm in 8th grade and many of the girls out there have many more years of experience. I went to my dad for advice since he played junior varsity and has also seen me play. In his opinion he didnt think I should try out because its a lot to take on during 8th grade. Then I went to some of my friends for their opinion on it and they gave me the confidence to go and try out. Right now Im on the softball team and very happy with the choice I made to try out.  It will take our time when we have a lot of homework to do and we don't get it done. It will also take our time because when we want to go shopping or need to go do something it will take our time. If you want us to tutor elementary school children we would have time taken away from learning at school. We have almost the same school hours like them. So we would take our school time away. If we want to we could ask you more about it. I know that helping the community is good and very important but not to spend all your time on it.  This can cause someone to come home late and not have time for homework. This will cause the student to have a bad grade on his progress report or report card. There can also be times when three different classes all have a major grade assignment due and they were all due at the same date. A player might not be home enough to do the project. They might also have a game that day. If they don't do there homework they wont be able to play, but if they don't come to a game they might get kicked off the team. So having a B average is like trying to win a losing battle for someone on a sports team.  I hope that you take this letter into your consideration, and I hope you decide well on this policy. Some may disagree, some may downright despise the policy, but in the end, it does everyone a favor, and that's hard to argue with from a logical standpoint. In the end, it's the simple fact that education comes before all else, because it's more likely that one would become a doctor, a lawyer, or an engineer than a professional sports player, and allowing the minimum work to pass won't help the student later on in life.  maybe they have a job, friends, family, personal things they are dealing with or have to do, and making that change will push them over the edge and stop them from playing. Also a C is a passing grade so the students are passing their classes and keeping up with school and everything else while playing a sport they love, so there isn't really any need to change the grade average. It is just unfair to the students. It is just too much for the kids to handle. it will hurt them not help them.  If they had lots of little siblings and both their parents were at work all day, then they would have to watch them and they would never find time to do things such as community service. Also someone that doesn't excel in school but wanted to get a scholarship would probably have to be working very hard almost all day to get good enough grades. And if someone knew they had no chance at getting a scholarship, but still wanted to go to college would have to be working hard in school and they would need a job so they would be able to pay for all the expenses of college. Another example would be someone that isn't good in school but is very talented in sports. They would want to be doing their sport so that they could be good enough to get an athletic scholarship. ",

Thank you for taking the time to read this.  I would first like start by saying that community service is a great thing. without a good community and those who help we have no community. I agree that students should be required to perform community service.  In my opinion, all students should perform community service.  In conclusion i disagree with students having to perform community service. It is hard for a student to complete all the things that they need to and do community service, i think whenever a student has free time they should use their time on something they really want to do or need to because students have a lot to deal with and they deserve every minute of free time they get and shouldn't waste it all the time on community service .  In my opinion, i think you should make all students perform some type of community service.  I disagree with your idea to require students to participate in community services. In my opinion we should have a choice in those sorts of things. Not only that but, what about homework, family, and other school or home related activities?  In my opinion I believe that students should not do community service for a plethora of ways.  I think you should require all students to perform community service because many students laze around with nothing to do, when they could be helping the community.  In my opinion i think that all students shouldn't have to participate in community service  To begin with , i think i strongly agree for us students to be required to do community service because we are the kids from the future and our earth will become a total dump .

The author then goes on, proceeding to help our visualization of NASA's plan, telling the reader that NASA would not directly put humans on Venus's surface, but rather have them float in a blimp-like vehicle above the startpoint of Venus's weather and \"avoid the unfriendly ground conditions by staying up ad out of their way.\" The author lastly pointed out how, even with the toasty weather, Venus' surface is still survivable for humans, even though it's not full of easy conditions.  When explaining NASA's ideas on sending humans to Venus, the author states, \"NASA\u0092s possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray.\" This provides evidence that shows what a solution is to avoiding some of the difficulties that occur when trying to explore Venus. The author was able to support his idea throught the use of NASA and it's research. The passage continues to come up with a plan on the best way to float above Venus when the author says, \"At thirty-plus miles above the surface, temperatures would still be toasty at around 170 degrees Fahrenheit, but the air pressure would be close to that of sea level on Earth.\" This factual evidence that is included ensures that the author is supporting this idea to the fullest of his potential. Researched and factual evidence that is provided all throughout the passage shows how the author supports this idea thoroughly and well.  The author says NASA has an idea on how to send humans to study Venus, \"...possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray\" (Paragraph 5). The ship would hover above, avoiding the dangerous conditions by remaining away from it. Allowing the scientists to be close enough to study some elements of Venus, and to have more context on how to understand it more, without a human possibly dying. To further support this, the author states, \"...hovering safely far above the planet can provide only limited insight...\" (Paragrah 6). The author is aware that hovering is not the most effectove technique, but he supports the idea by hinting it will still be worth it because information can still be gathered, despite the limits.  I agree with him in this claim because if humans can explore Venus, I also believe we can go on to do bigger and better things with exploring our solar system  Venus having an average of 800 degrees fahrenheit on its surface, make's it virtually inhabitable to humans. These conditons are so extreme the author explains that \"such an environment would crush even a submarine accustomed too diving to the deepest parts of our oceans.\" Venus has very harsh conditions and it make's it virtually impossible to explore it from the surface and proposes a tough challenge on finding alternatives ways to explore it. Although, NASA has proposed an idea to explore the harsh planet. NASA believes we can explore the planet from a distance approximately 30 miles away. The author explains that the pressure would be comparable to sea level on earth, tempature would be around 170 degrees. The author states that \"Not easy conditions but survivable for humans.\" The mission would propose great danger and it would be a expontential battle, but with the right people and technology it could be done and accomplished. The benefit is the knowledge gained from this great planet that has had the world beat for a long time, it is time to step up to the challenge and explore Venus for the people of this world.  NASA has came up with a \u00a8solution\u00a8 of the problemof gaining knowledge of Venus which is for a vehicle to hover over Venus and scientists would safely observe the planet that way.  When discussing the exploration of Venus, most people are turned off by its reputation as a dangerous and challenging planet for humans to study. While the author doesn't stray away from these harsh extremities, they make sure to prove how these details seem insignificant and how safe travel can still be executed. The author thoroughly describes the plan provided by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) to allow astronauts to float above the fray and avoid the hazardous conditions. They provide specific qualities of the plan, such as the air pressure being close to the sea level on Earth, the abundance of solar power, and the containment of radiation, to prove how humans would be kept in a safe atmosphere. They even provide a real world connection between NASA's possible solution and a blimp-like vheicle hovering around the ground to make it easier for the audience to understand. The author combats the speculaiton of Venus being too dangerous to explore in order to further support the idea of it being a worthy pursuit.  Obviously, the idea of sending humans to Venus far excedes our current technology, but traveling to that planet may be the future of humanity.  With Sulfuric Acid in Venus' atmosphere, and surface temperatures being over 425 degrees Celcius (about 700 K or 800 F) , the likelyhood of humans on Venus is nearly nonexistent to begin with. To combat the hot temperatures and the acidic atmosphere, NASA proposed the idea of a \"blimp\" that floats above the planet's shell. Although the blimp could survive high in the air, the practicality of if is not present. Having a blimp that cannot touch the planet is not going to help scientific research at all. While being above the clouds of Venus, it is impossible to see the surface with human eyes. Seeing the surface would require technology that uses light from the electromagnetic spectrum with a high frequency and short wavelength. It is also impossible to collect rock samples from the planet for soil examination. This idea would not be beneficial enough for the risk of investing a lot of time and money.  When discussing the potential plans to explore the planet, the author states \"Many researches are working on innovations that would allow our machines to last long enough to contribute meaningfully to our knowledge of Venus.\" This quote makes it clear to the audience that scientists are doing whatever it takes to develop multiple, efficient plans for space travel. The author also goes onto provide different examples to further convey how close scientists are to developing the safest plan possible. They specifically mention the use of simplified electronics made of silicon carbide and explain how they've already been tested in a chamber that simulate the conditions of Venus's surfaces, yet how they're still being improved upon. They also describe an old technology called mechanical computer, noting how this technology has already been used frequently in the 1940's and how it can be incorporated into space travel now. The author has given detailed descriptions of the efforts made and the options available to provide a safe embarkment for humans to support the ideas that Venus is a worthy pursit. ",

The proof is in the article when you see the 3 picutes that were taken to prove it wasn't a alien made artifact. No matter how cool it would be if it was not to mention that it could make NASA famous or rich it just doesn't have the proof you need to be a alien artifact. If you look more into the passage it even says it was not a alien made artiffact. Yes this face was very famous it even says \"The \"Face\" on Mars has since been a pop icon. It has starred in a Hollywood film, apperered in books, magazines, and even radio shows.\" (5). See how famous that face was 25 years ago is amazing but it still doesn't mean it was a alien made artiffact. So in final say it is not a alien made face and nor will there be enough proof its just a landmark on Mars that was very popular to people everywhere!            It does look like it could be from another living organism, but it's just a rock on the planet. In our newest image of the rock, it turns out that the face has dissapered. There is no evidence of this being created by aliens, rather it was created by wind and water that has been found on Mars. The reason you might believe that this was indeed aliens, might be the fact that the news has blown it out of poportion. It's just the rock that had some interesting shadows and holes that made it look like a human face.  I must say that, in my opinion The Face on Mars is indeed NOT created by aliens. It is simply illogical.  There you have it. The Face sadly wasn't built by aliens, it was just a natural landform that happened to have some pretty neat features to it due to shadows. There is no way around it, because the pictures don't lie. It is even more obvious that it is a landform because ones just like it exist on Earth! Even though it would've been very interesting for it to have been actually created by aliens, it was just a natural landform in the end.  In conclusion, some people may think there is alien life on Mars because of past picture or conspiracy theories. No one can denty however, that NASA has proven the Face to be nothing but a natural landform on the Red Planet Mars. NASA has proven this by recent pictures, scientific evidence, and real-life examples and measurements. Over the years, NASA has worked hard to figure out the mystery of the face, and just recently they have discovered, with pictyures, evidence, and measruements, that the Face is just a natural landform with unusual shadowing formed on the Red Planet Mars.  So, while some conspiracy theorists would like to think that aliens created this well-known face on Mars, they are incorrect. The face on Mars is just a natural landform that was wrongly perceived by the public. By advancing in digital technology, understanding the effect of shadows, and realizing that there is no evidence to support aliens on Mars, it can be concluded that the face on Mars is just another peculiar natural landform.  I find it highly unrealistic that NASA would even have been able to determine what the Face was forty years ago, much less hiding a discovery of extra-terrestrial life that could make a huge profit for the space program. And, had NASA really claimed that the Face was an object built by otherworldly life, surely someone would let the cat out of the bag. Not to mention that, if the vast majority of NASA believed it was an alien monument, do you really think that they would wait eighteen years to investigate the subject again? On top of all of this, it's simply illogical that aliens would create such a thing. As far as we all know, the supposed \"aliens\" on Mars have never come in contact with a human, much less seen one. That only leaves possible explanation; aliens created a monument that of which coincedentally resembles a human head. An absolute coincedence.  With all of the technology used to investigate the red planet, proof of alien life should have already been found. Jim Garvin, chief scientist for NASA's Mars Exploration Program explained, \"As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size...So, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!\" By stating this, Garvin is saying that if there was any evidence of aliens builing this face on Mars, it would have been found.  The \"face\" isn't any perticular shape that any man or alien would want. The landform would be shaped as a circle, square or any other simple shape, and it would not be so ridgid and cracked. If you were to look at the photo furthest to the left, you would assume that it resembled a face, but If you compair that photo to the one taken twenty-five years later, you would begin to understand that to photo was out-dated and that the camera was not as clear as the one taken later. In addition, why would an alien make a structure of a human's face.   Even thoug hmy colleague still believes in the \"Face on Mars\" to be a alien made structure. I still believe it's only a butte or mesa. With my evindence of the \"Face on Mars\" only looking like a face due to the techonology of the time, the shadows of the sun, the angle the picture was taken, and our ability to see faces when none are there, I believe I have conclusive evidence that the \"Face on Mars is nothing but a butte or mesa.

                "content": "In the second paragraph, the author states \"...Often referred to as Earth's twin, Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size, and occasionally the closest in distance too.\"  Venus, otherwise known as the \"Evening Star,\" is one of the more challenging planets to examine closely in our solar system. While this plant is often called Earth's twin, it is vastly different in terms of environment and hospitability. Despite being the closest planet to Earth at times, no spaceship has touched down on Venus in over thirty years. The dangers presented by Venus are many, but the author greatly supports the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite these dangers.  The writer claims that Venus is referred to as Earth's \"twin''. But the only evidence he gives to back up this claim is that \"Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of desnity and size.\"  He states that Venus is often referred to as Earth's \"twin\". This is because Venus and Earth are close in size, density, and at some points in orbit are the closest planets in the solar system. It is also believed that at one point, Venus was a lot like Earth is now. \"The Challenge of Exploring Venus\" states, \"Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our soloar system.\". The article goes on to say Venus most likely had large oceans that supported life, and the planet has things like craters, valleys, and mountains that we also have here on Earth. The author including these details helps get the point across that Venus is a lot like Earth, and with the little research been done already, we've found so much. This helps readers understand that the longer Venus is studied, the more we will learn about it.  That suggests that we already know some facts about Venus such as it's density and size, which is enough to make people curious to how much about Venus we already know. He said that we know that Venus has many similar structures to Earth, such as mountains, valleys, and craters. If Venus is Earth's \"twin,\" doesn't mean that it is extremely similar to Earth? The statement could make people curious about how close Venus really is to Earth, or it could make them wonder why we should bother risking people's safety if we already know that Venus is just like Earth  Venus is the second planet in the solar system from the sun that precedes Earth in the planetary order. This planet is often called Earth's \"twin\" and the \"Evening Star\" of the universe because of its brightness and relative similarity to the Earth. In the article, \"The Challenge of Exploring Venus,\" the author presents facts and figures that one could use to determine whether studying Venus would be an advantageous pursuit even though it would not be very safe. The author focuses more on the drawbacks of exploring Venus, hence the title of this work.  The author explains points in Venus' history that have intrigued astronomers, \"Long ago, Venus was probably covered largelyt with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, \" (4). Besides having been closer to Earth's \"twin\" many years ago, Venus may be more similar than humans thought, shown through \"The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters,\" (4). Studying Venus could lead to us knowing why this planet is such a far cry from Earth now, and this could provide valuable with how humans interact with their environment. If Venus has such similar features to Earth, like valleys, then there is probably more to discover on Venus' surface. This peculiar connection between this planet and Venus shows how valuable exploration could prove, just as Venus' proximity further supports how worthy of a pursuit Venus is.  While providing simple, yet interesting facts about Venus, such as it being the planet closest to Earth's density and size, may be enough to intrigue the audience into wanting to learn more about the planet, the author takes it a step further. The author goes in depth about the possibility of Venus being the most Earth-like planet in our solar system long ago. They detail the planet's environment today, consisting of Earth-like structures such as rocky sediment surfaces, valleys, mountans, craters, and other geological findings. They also state \"Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth.\" This information opens up an entirely new realm of possibilites for the audience to consider, and is more likely to interest them as it directly relates to our life on Earth. The way the author has set up the comparisons of Earth and Venus have allowed the audience to view the exploration of the planet as an opportunity to see a planet that could be like us; a planet with living, breathing forms of life similar to what we see everyday. The author uses this information to encourage the audience to view the pursuit of Venus as a chance to gain information on the things we see in our everyday life, and not just complex ideas that are difficult to understand and most-likely won't affect them.  Venus may have one of the harshest climates in our solar system, with an average temperature of 800 degrees Farenheit, and an atmospheric pressure 90 times greater than Earth's. Despite these major differences, it is also believed to be the closest to Earth by means of geological similarity. As stated in the article, scientists believe that Venus was most likely covered with oceans and quite possibly could have even hosted life. This idea is gathered from the similarities in structures between Earth and that volcano of a planet, like valleys, mountains, and an atmosphere.  This furthers the point more that NASA is also trying to send humans to go visit and study our planet's \"twin\". The author then goes on, proceeding to help our visualization of NASA's plan, telling the reader that NASA would not directly put humans on Venus's surface, but rather have them float in a blimp-like vehicle above the startpoint of Venus's weather and \"avoid the unfriendly ground conditions by staying up ad out of their way.\" The author lastly pointed out how, even with the toasty weather, Venus' surface is still survivable for humans, even though it's not full of easy conditions.

                "content": "When people go out of thier way to vote, they vote because they want to have a say in their potentially future. They vote for who they believe would lead our society and modern day world in the right direction. They would like to think that one vote could make a difference in a election, but with the Electoral College voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference rather than vote who they actulally want to be president.  With over 300 million people now in the United States, under a unified country that promotes and exemplifies democracy, we have not been democratic in the sense that peoples vote doesnt even go to their president, only to another mind that can cast you away as if you were not important. As stated in Par. 7 Source 1 an article by the Office of the Federal Register \"Most states have a winner-take-all system that awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate.\" These are the minds that are sometimes chosen at random, or by other factors to represent you, a choice you werent allowed to make. The winner takes all method only takes away from states like Texas and California who know their vote doesnt matter because these people will always agree on democratic or republican, and what is currently used in our society. This damages thousands of voices, thousands of votes that could have matter, but seemingly don't. Just like\u00a0 how schools have implemented the 'No Child Left Behind' policy, we should transcribe this to leaving no american citizen without a voice, only dependant on what state their in.  Our country is changing day by day, and we certainly have made monumental changes since the Electoral College came to be. According to Bradford Plumer, author of, \"The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong,\" a poll was taken by Gallup in the year 2000 that showed that less than just forty percent of Americans support the election system that we have now. This proves that it is time for a change and that the system that we currently have in place has been in place for far too long. The everchanging United States of America is in desperate need of an up-to-date election system that fits the current needs of the American people. The Electoral College is not only outdated, but it is also an extremely complex voting method. In an article entitled, \"What Is the Electoral College,\" written by the Office of the Federal Register, it is explained that the Electoral College is a lengthy process that involves the choosing of electors and the issuing of Certificates of Ascertainment after both the people and the electors have voted. The Electoral College does far more harm than good for our country and for this reason especially, I believe that America should begin to elect its Presidents using the popular voting method.  In this system, according to the second source, popular vote, which is what the majority people select, most of the time loses the election due to the Electoral System. An Example used in this source was the 2000 election with Al Gore, he had won the popular vote, but had lost the election thanks to the Electoral College. With this system in play, voters cannot control who they want to vote for and that is not how it should be. In source one, it clearly states most states have a \"winner-take-all\" type of system that awards all electors of that state to the specific candidate, which is the complete opposite of benefiting the people, because not everyone in that state wants to vote for that specific candidate. Source 3 says big states that a larger state gets more attention than a smaller state does because of the amount of votes, however some states claim they never even got to see a presidential campaign had because of how small the states was. Its is Unfair to these states which include Rhode Island, South Carolina. It takes away opportunities from these smaller states.  Many people remember the problem of the 2000 presidential election. The Electoral College had very effectively exemplified its flaws and unefficient ways of opperating. Al Gore and George Bush were running apposed, and despite winning the overall popular vote in the country, Gore lost the election to Bush. Bush had received the most electoral votes, therefore winning him the presidency. Basically, despite the fact that more citizens chose Gore to be president, Bush won out. In our constitution it is written that citizens of the United States have an unwavering right to vote and select who gets put into office. In this case, it sounds more like the number of electoral votes has an unwavering right to select who gets put into office.  What is the point of people voting if they are not really getting a say in who they are really voting for? The Electoral College has a bigger say then the thousands of of people who vote. How can a group of peoples say mean more then thousands of people in the United States. Also, the \"Winner-Take-All\" sytem does not help anymore then the Electoral college does. What is so special about the Electoral College that they get picked specially to make their vote count on who wins or loses the election?  Eeveryone should have a say in what goes on where ever it is that they live. We the people make up the government. Who draws the line that states whether or not you are allowed to vote. We do! Therefore we should be able to decied ourselves who can be our president to the United States of America. It is niot fair that we need to elect others to have our submission be made. Even when we tell our electors who we choose, they might turn arouhd and vote for the other person. In  Source 2 \"The indefensible electorial college : why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong by Bradford Plumer\"  backs up my response when stating,\"In the same vein, 'faithless' electors have ocasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please...\". That to me my friend, is not fair at all.  It isn't right to select a few people from each state to decide who the President will be. That power lies with the people, and nobody should be able to take that away. The votes of millions and millions of people are out-weighed by the votes of a few hundred men and women. This is unjust and unfair in every way. If all the people in the United States wanted somebody as President, but the Electoral College disagreed, the Electoral College would win. Why should the Electoral College have more power than all of the people of the United States; they shouldn't. The power to decide who is President of the United States of America should always lie with the good citizens that live here.   The U.S government lets people choose these electors so they feel important in the choices our country makes. We take time to study our favorite candidates, and if the electoral college does not agree with them, they are pushed to the side. What happens to the people who did not vote for the, \"right\" candidate? They are forever unheard. Sentenced to live in a community where they are silcenced. I do not agree with the electoral college because agree with our fore father Abraham Lincoln. He said this was supposed to be a country of the people, by the people, and for the people.   Many people when they vote for example, a democratic representative, they expect the democratic representative to vote for the democratic canadate for president.  Unfortununtly, sometimes that is not the case.  The democratic representative will end up voting for the Republican canadate for president.  This issue occurs many times in the Electoral College which is why people are having second thoughts about the Electoral College and wanting to eliminate it so that they can directly vote for the president or vice president they want and think will improve our country more.

                "content": "We can learn about our human bodies and why emotion is displayed so easily, and how it's displayed as well. \"According to the Facial Feedback Theory of Emotion, moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions, but also may even help produce them.\" Our faces can move in multiple ways depending on the emotion we feel, as shown in paragraphs 7-8. Why does it do this? This technology can give us a valid reason to talk about the science of emotion more, and we can learn more about this as students or even as teachers.  It is no secret that many students dread coming to school, whether it be from stress, bullying, or simply not understanding the subjects. This system can pick up on a fake emotion, the author explains how it can read a \"fake smile\" and that to them \"faces don't lie\" (para. 8). If this system is able to sense when a student is unhappy or angry, this could be used as an advantage in helping the student. Not only this, but the author explains that \"moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions, but may even help produce them\" (para. 9). Taking both of these statements into account, and allowing them to be incorporated into the classroom, students may enjoy attending school and learning new things.  The article states that the technology associates each emotion with \"characteristic movements of the facial muscles\" and then uses those movements to calculate the spectrum of emotions based on their facial display. But some people show emotions in various ways, and the technology most likely cannot accomodate for the many different ways people express the same emotion. For example, if a student has a resting face that seems generally happy, the system might confuse this dazed face as a satisfied face and think that the student is happy with their lessons when they are actually confused or not paying attention. In the same way, if a student has a resting face that looks naturally sad, the system may think they are unhappy with their lessons, even if the student feels they are learning a lot. A lot of students also try to hide their emotions, like frusteration or sadness, with a happier look on their face, and even though the article states that the system can detect a \"false smile\", it cannot always be accurate as a person may be good at hiding their emotions and displaying a genuine smile. Therefore, since technology is not always accurate and because human beings are so various in the way they behave, the technology would not be useful in a classroom where it may misread a student's state of mind and lead them in the wrong path of education.  In the third passage of the artice, the author states, \"Eckman has classified six basic emotions-happiness ... and then associated each with charactersitic movements of the facial muscles,\" meaning that the software associated voluntary or involuntary movements of the face with emotions. The problem with this system is that students can change the look of their face quite easily, and can thus convince the computer to produce desired results, making the system disfunctional. There are quite a few reasons children, especially young ones, would want to make the software not work, including tricking the computer into moving from the original learning program into a more desired one and them simply wanting to see the program fail through their abilities.  Emotion is in the brain, not the heart. The way the FACS understands emoion is simple. It maps out a 3-D model of the face, looks at the shape and positoin of all the muscles, then it associates the different facial movements with differet emotion. For example, your orbicularis oris (muscles around your mouth) tighten your lips to show when you are angry. It even works when a person it trying to mask emotions. During a fake smile, the zygomatic major stretches the mouth sidways, while in a real smile the zygomatic major lifts the corners of the mouth. These examples can show how science IS able to understand emotoin, probaly better than most humans. Arguments that use that falshood, that science is unable to understand emotion, is completly false.  It can read a total of six emotions with some branches coming off of those emotions. The six emotions are stated in the quote,\" Eckman has classified six basic emotions - happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness - and then associated each with characteristic movements of the facial muscles.\" The machine is able to determine whether a student is in distress or not thus telling the teacher to help the student out with the problem that they are facing. The teacher would be able to help the student cope and deal with their emotional sadness or anger and tell them how to deal with it in order to assist them in getting through it. This is not the end though of what this incredible machine can do for a school.  Dr. Huang also explains that \"the facial expressions for each emotion are universal\" reguardless of the desgree of expression, (D'Alto). Finally, the fear of more computer based activities is rapidly squashed by the contradiction that being more aware should envoke more human interaction, not lesson it.  Every living thing on planet earth has emotions. These emotions have been used since the beginning of time to express the feelings of the people around you. However, these emotions can be decieving. Someone could say they are happy, when really they are angry or upset. This is where the Facial Action Coding System comes into play. The FACS is a software that detects human emotion by tracking muscles in the face. For example, when you are happy, muscles in your face move up, and when you are sad, they move down, FACS tracks this and calculates your emotions. The creators of this software, Prof. Thomas Huang and Prof. Nicu Sebe are the leading experts of developing better ways for humans and computers to communicate. There are still some questions surrounding the usefulness of FACS, like what could this software actually be used for? One of the ways FACS may be used is in classrooms.  Dr. Huang is talking about the device using video images to pick up the emotions of each person. Dr. H states \"using video imagery, The new emotion recognition software tracks these facial movments in a real face or on a painted face.\" This quote brings to light that the machine can read emotions but one could say since it is still in new development that not all of the bugs or glitches have been worked out not only that but you also have to devote more resources to keep the machine working which can average to be a heafty hit to your wallet.  According to the article \"Making Mona Lisa Smile,\" there is a new technology called the Facial Action Coding System (FACS) that enables computers to identify human emotions. This technology is relatively brand new. It creates a 3-D computer model of all fourty-four major muscles in the face that move like human muscles as well. Then, psychologists have classified six basic emotions that are associated with different movements in the facial mucles. This new technology could result in many benefits in our community as well as all around the world ",

Driverless cars are the step in the right direction for driving innovations all across the world.  The development of driverless cars would be an amazing in incredibly helpful step for society and the car manufacturing world.  Younger generations of people in our modern world are becoming increasingly attuned to smart technology,with developments such as the smartphone, smart watch, etc. spreading throughout the nation. The introduction of a driverless car would further stimulate this already existing dependency, which could lead to problems down the road.  Technology has become almost fully integrated into today's society. Computers, smart phones, and more are used in a positive aspect; the driverless car is no exception.  In conclusion, driverless cars have brought about many new benefits in our society. From their ease of access to consumers to the top level of safety features that are sure to be made available in them, they will clearly become the top option of vehicle to use in our society once enough of them are made. This technological innovation is capable of doing many wonders in the automotive industry.  In our society, technology is advancing significantly by the day. What was once a letter that took 10-day trip overseas to its appropriate destination is now just a simple text message that reaches a person within seconds. The automobile is an innovation that has also advanced dramatically, enough to the point where almost every person who can afford to have one does because of its necessity when transportation becomes a factor. The idea of a car becoming \"driverless\" is simply another boost in the technology available to cars today, as discussed in \"Driverless Cars are Coming.\"  I believe that Driverless cars are going to be a very important nessesity to the development and transition of transportaion technology. Transportation will change from getting to places by using your own brain, to getting to places without having to really think about what you are doing while you are going somewhere.  I stand with the makeing of these cars and the possiblities that come with in our society. The cars would be able to open new doors to health benefits, lowering crash ratios, and much more. The driverless car would be a great achievement in human curisosity and invention. These cars would better many different levels of society if made and used propely.  In the 1960's driverless cars seemed more as like a futuristic fantasy rather than reality, but in todays world, they just might be the next big thing. In the late 1950's, General Motors created a concept car that could run on a special test track (Ph. 3). Although this was the first concept of a \"smart car\", the roads would need an unrealistic upgrade that would cost extremely to much. Today however, we have the technology to make real driverless cars. The toll of human error has been evident in the auto-age as more accidents happen every year.  I do believe driverless cars if thought through and corrected for mistakes can become a valuable asset to modern day community. These cars could lead to a increase in driving, and traveling for families and could also lead to the question of what can we do with this technology now? I feel that these questions are a very good thing in the advanceing technology of this age and that the still developing cars should not be frowned upon, but seen as a step forward into atoumating our country.

NASA says the have witness alot of things up that we dont know or could even imagin there could be life on every plant and if there is I know we all want to witness it one day. I know I am not the only one who would want to explore through out the box through out the earth but may I say the question is still out there for me for you for the future. So let that be known that you and me and what ever is out there are alike curious to seek and craving for advanture. You and me both will fly out of here hand by hand sister to brother to find whats on mars in the future qustion that is waiting to be answerd will be seen head smelled by the ones who are seeking that adventure to answer that qustion that we all what to know.

                "content": "NASA. The United States form of a dominating space academy. The Viking 1, was in fact NASA's spacecraft that was launched in 2001. The spacecraft was set course for the small, red planet that is simillar to Earth. The planet is called Mars. Viking 1's \"sister\" Viking 2 was supposed to be landing on Mars, and that's why Viking 1 was sent up in space to begin with. While Viking 1 was snapping photos, its camera picked up a weird face-like structure on the surface of Mars. Some believe its a mysterious face that \"so called aliens\" built. I believe that their reasoning is just a bunch of garbage.  While NASA never spoke negatively about the theory, they set out again to prove it wrong. on April 8, 2001, the Mars Global Surveyor came over the face on Mars, and it took photos with a resolution of 1.56 meters per pixel; the highest ever yet. What these pictures showed was what would be a butte or a mesa on Earth. These landforms are very common in Cydonia, so the pictures were very realistic.  Like we said during this speech we said that \"And so on April 5, 1998, when Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing... a natural landform.\" Later on we did it again in the speech \"Nevertheless, on April 8, 2001- a cloudless summer day in Cydonia- Mars Global Surveyor drew close enough for a second look. \"We had to roll the spacecraft 25 degrees to center the Face in the field of view,\" Said Garving. \"Malin's team captured an extraordinary photo using the camera's absolute maximum resolution.\" \"Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo.\" Now you may say that we never did that, but we have photographic evidence of that clear photo that lets you see everything on the face. So we have the evidence we need to prove that this photo is real.  In 1976, Viking 1 took photos of Mars and found a huge rock formation that remebled a human head with shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth.  This was soon to be known as the \"Face on Mars\".   NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft has found something while circling  Mars. But what is it, they have seem to have found a face formed into the rocks. Is this new discovery actually a face or is it just another rock formation.  The believers and the non-believers of the face on Mars are waiting anxiously to find out what it is. Is it a rock formation or is it an actual human face, no one knows  In 1976, the Viking 1 spacecraft was orbiting the planet of Mars, and it was taking new pictures for all of mankind to see. As it was passing over a strip of Mars called Cydonia, it snapped a picture that would cause an uproar in space exploration. This new picture showed what seemed to be a human face. A few days later NASA reveled these pictures for the world to see; it was an instant hit  To start, NASA has taken recent picture of Cydonia in 2001 that shows it is just a natural landform that has developed on the Red Planet Mars. \"On April 8. 2001--a cloudless summer day in Cydonia--Mars Global Surveyor drew close enough for a second look. \"We had to roll the spacecraft 25 degreesto center the Face in the field of view,\" said Garvin. \"Malin's team captured an extraordinary photo using the camera's absolute maximum resolution.\" Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel inv the best 1976 Viking photo.\" (p. 10).  In 1988 a Viking 1 took a, slightly disturbing, picture. Of a face! Viking 1 found a landform that happends to look like an Egyptian Pharoah. This face was found and started major controversy.  Some people had thought that it was fake and others thought that it was just a coincidence. The massive sand storms just created a face. That's all that they thought. But can that be true?   The face has been a pop icon ever since the discovery of the formation. the face will always be a piece of history and will always been known to man. If there was an actual face on Mars then that would be a sign of life. The face ended up eing a mesa and nothing else besides that. Although it would have been an exciting discovery for NASA, we still have much more of space that is unknown and unexplored. NASA is bound to find some kind of incredible object. We will have to wait until that day comes and find something incredible and will be part of the incredible true story of space.              No matter what people believed after they saw the picture taken in 1998, the picture taken on April 8, 2001 was the one that proved to the skeptics that the Face was a naturally occurring landform.

                "content": "As described in paragraph 6, a students facial expression has the power to change a lesson. If this is true, could a student not simply fake an emotion to get out of assignments or slack off by acting confused. The article claims that the software can pick up on fake smiles, but can it detect false expressions for other emotions as well? Another flaw within this system is the emotions the technology is capable of percieving, paragraph 6 disscusses the modification of a lesson based on boredom or confusion detected by the computer, however, neither of these two feelings are listed in the 6 emotions that the software is capable of detecting (paragraph 3). These two major flaws within the software lead to only one conclusion, the technology is simply not advanced enough to take on the role of a teacher.  With the constant evoultion of the way we learn, its not suprising that something like FACS was created. Emotions have been with everything living since the beginning of time. Before FACS, it was suprisingly difficult to read these emotions in people. Such a crucial part of our everyday lives could be easily hidden away by a fake smile or a theatre tear. But now that there is FACS helping out, looks are no longer decieving.  Life contains many differences, includes positive and negative things, truthful or untruthful. Some people said emotions are never lie. We could figure out the statue of someone by looking at their face, and that's true. However, life is something really complicated, sometimes things in front of you don't mean like what you think. Likewise, even though the expression from people face is the most authenic, when they are trying to hide their feelings, we literally cannot know their real emotions. The changing of teenager is issue that causes headache for parents, their characters aren't the same like before, their emotions are changed. Both of them could not find the common speech, and push them further each other. That is the moment, the childrens easily fall in the darkness. For real instance, children or students aren't agree about their parent's thinking, or the education from school completely. Most of them don't say it out, or talk back. It's really affects about effective in studying and their plans in the future.  Emotion is in the brain, not the heart. The way the FACS understands emoion is simple. It maps out a 3-D model of the face, looks at the shape and positoin of all the muscles, then it associates the different facial movements with differet emotion. For example, your orbicularis oris (muscles around your mouth) tighten your lips to show when you are angry. It even works when a person it trying to mask emotions. During a fake smile, the zygomatic major stretches the mouth sidways, while in a real smile the zygomatic major lifts the corners of the mouth. These examples can show how science IS able to understand emotoin, probaly better than most humans. Arguments that use that falshood, that science is unable to understand emotion, is completly false.  If we were to simply put that first fact aside and instead look at the ability for this technology to assist students in an ideal setting, we still find that students can fake their emotions in order to cheat the system.  It is no secret that many students dread coming to school, whether it be from stress, bullying, or simply not understanding the subjects. This system can pick up on a fake emotion, the author explains how it can read a \"fake smile\" and that to them \"faces don't lie\" (para. 8). If this system is able to sense when a student is unhappy or angry, this could be used as an advantage in helping the student. Not only this, but the author explains that \"moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions, but may even help produce them\" (para. 9). Taking both of these statements into account, and allowing them to be incorporated into the classroom, students may enjoy attending school and learning new things.  The article states that the technology associates each emotion with \"characteristic movements of the facial muscles\" and then uses those movements to calculate the spectrum of emotions based on their facial display. But some people show emotions in various ways, and the technology most likely cannot accomodate for the many different ways people express the same emotion. For example, if a student has a resting face that seems generally happy, the system might confuse this dazed face as a satisfied face and think that the student is happy with their lessons when they are actually confused or not paying attention. In the same way, if a student has a resting face that looks naturally sad, the system may think they are unhappy with their lessons, even if the student feels they are learning a lot. A lot of students also try to hide their emotions, like frusteration or sadness, with a happier look on their face, and even though the article states that the system can detect a \"false smile\", it cannot always be accurate as a person may be good at hiding their emotions and displaying a genuine smile. Therefore, since technology is not always accurate and because human beings are so various in the way they behave, the technology would not be useful in a classroom where it may misread a student's state of mind and lead them in the wrong path of education.  Every living thing on planet earth has emotions. These emotions have been used since the beginning of time to express the feelings of the people around you. However, these emotions can be decieving. Someone could say they are happy, when really they are angry or upset. This is where the Facial Action Coding System comes into play. The FACS is a software that detects human emotion by tracking muscles in the face. For example, when you are happy, muscles in your face move up, and when you are sad, they move down, FACS tracks this and calculates your emotions. The creators of this software, Prof. Thomas Huang and Prof. Nicu Sebe are the leading experts of developing better ways for humans and computers to communicate. There are still some questions surrounding the usefulness of FACS, like what could this software actually be used for? One of the ways FACS may be used is in classrooms.  The technology is able to identfy a human's true emotions, but that will not alter the way that person feels.  people have different biases. ",

The author uses strong details to support this claim throughout the article. Facts and statistics by NASA and other reliable sources are used to back the claims. The author stands by the opinion that Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents.  In \" The Challenge of Exploring Venus\", the author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit because Venus is interesting, helpful, and it is safe  Clearly, the author has efficiently and convincingly supported the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. By describing all the information about the existence of other life forms and the similarities to Earth that we could potentially learn from the study, the author proves how worthy Venus is to be discovered. The author also rebuttals one of the main concerns for traveling to the planet by explaining how plans are being developed to make travel and living conditions surviveable, safe, and efficient for both humans and machines. In \"The Challenge of Exploring Venus,\" the author was able to convey and support the idea that Venus is worthy of exploration.  Studying Venus seems almost impossible with all the risks, but the author of \"The Challenge of Exploring Venus\" suggests that Venus is a worthy pursuit despite all the dangers it presents.  In \"The Challenge of Exploring Venus,\" the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents is supported through Venus' vast similarities to Earth, Venus' proximity to Earth, and the innovation in machines by researchers that could make them work long enough to expand mankind's knowledge on Venus. The idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers is supported through Venus' vast similarites to Earth, which is why humans have such interest in this particular planet. The idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the presented dangers is conveyed through Venus' proximity. The idea that Venus is a worthy pursuit despite its hostile environment is supported through the innovation in machines that could make the close-up exploration of Venus possible. The author believes that sometimes humans cannot let curiosity, imagination, and innovation be trampled by the dangers and doubts. Humans cannot live in fear all the time. The human spirit always demands that humans continue striving towards knowing more.    The author presents a strong argument suggesting a worthy pursuit to study Venus depsite dangerous endeavors, however, his statments regauarding un-reliability on current technology, the necessary actions to conduct research, and numerous failed attempts to reach Venus greatly outweigh the good outcomes of this mission.  The author demonstrates how the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents by explaining many supporting reasons. They make it obvious that Venus is indeed safe to visit under the right precautions and that, with all the facts provided in paragraphs 4,5, and 6, it is a planet that us survivable for humans. The author supports thier standpoint fairly well with all the information they provided, even referencing NASA. This author fairly supports the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers.  In \"The Challenge of Exploring Venus,\" the author provides a compelling and efficient argument to support the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers. Using statistics, factual information, and specific plans being developed as we speak, the author convinces the audience that exploring Venus is worth the risks involved.  The author very well supports the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers. They are very pasionate about the idea because they provide lots of facts and reasoning to further support the claim.  Therefore, the author supports his idea, \"that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents,\" by giving us multiple reasons why we need the knowlage, how it affects us and how we will accomplish that. First, by telling us that Venus is like our twin planet and learning what happened we could adapt. Secondly, by showing us that we are can prevent our own downfall. Lastly, the author tells us how NASA expects to pull this off. ",

                "content": "Venus is the closest planet to us in our solar system, which means we should explore it. At least, that is what the author of \"The Challenge of Exploring Venus\" believes.  In conclusion, since our technology isn't advanced enough, it would take far too many years to do, and the human and money costs wuold be outrageously high, we should not explore Venus. Exploring Venus proves to be very dangerous, and we have proved that we are no where near being ready for such a task. We would first need to advance our technology for the task. This would take years to due, it would also use up a ton of money, and put people in serious danger. The author did a terrible job of supporting the idea that exploring Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dnagers it presents. For one, there were not enough facts presented in the article that were beneficiary to the idea. Also, of the pros that were present, the cons outweighed then tremendously. Exploring Venus proves to be a terrible idea, atleast until we are actually ready to do it.       In summary, we should continue studying the planet Venus despite the dangers because if anything were to happen to our planet, Earth, Venus would be the closest planet we could go to, we could learn more about Venus and the planet's harsh conditions, and because Venus is most like Earth and had the ability to support life. Furthering our research on Venus can only benefit us, so lets stop worrying about the dangers and get out and explore our planetary neighbor.  In conclusion the reasons for exploring Venus include how close it is to the sun, how similar it is to Earth, and how it could have supported life forms long ago. Yes, it is very dangerest because of high temperature and pressure. But if we come up with a way to lower the temperature and pressure it will be surely worth the work put in. These reason are way we should try to visit Venus in the future.  This means there is a worthy reason to explore Venus; to discover another habitable planet. Along with successful life on Venus, our modern technology could also survive the planet. Paragraph 5 states, \"Imagine a blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the roiling Venusian landscape. Just as our jet airplanes travel at a higher altitude to fly over many storms, a vehicle hovering over Venus would avoid the unfriendly ground codnitions by staying up and out of their way\" (The Challenge of Exploring Venus). Moreover, if airplanes are already in existence, new aircrafts would need to be slightly adjusted to suit the conditions of Venus. The author's claim is supported in this quote because this is another reason Venus is worth exploring. The technology needed is already almost perfect for the planet, therefore not a problem NASA would have to approach.  People are facinated with the Man on the Moon and the idea of Martians, but most people do not think about life on Venus. Venus is the second planet from the sun and shares many geographical features with Earth. However, studying this planet is made difficult by the dense and toxic atmosphere, high temperatures, and violent weather. Despite this, some people think that Venus should still be explored, and the author of \"The Challenge of Exploring Venus\" is of this opinion.  Exploring Venus would a beinificail and woth while scientific endver. Over the years Venus has been a topic of study due to its earth like qualites. The temperature of Venus is not as freindly to humans as our own atmosphereVenus is one the closest planets to own planet than most others. Lastly, the exploration of venus can be the next ground breaking scientific discovery yet.  In conclusion the author does not give many benefits to exploring Venus. All he really did was list the benefits to why we shouldnt explore Venus. In my personal opinion if i where a scientest and somone read me this i would not want to explore Venus. In the end i do not believe the author makes a good case to explore Venus.  Similarly, the author provides little reasoning behind the belief that humanity should explore the planet Venus.  Despite claiming that \"Venus can sometimes be our nearest option for a planetary visit\", there is little evidence given that exploring and observing Venus would be of much benefit. In fact, the author seems to have found more evidence against Venus exploration, as the prior paragraph (which listed reasons that Venus was dangerous) was much more explicit and detailed than paragraph 3. The negatives of exploring Venus (such as death and wasted money or time) seem to far outweigh the positives. ",

                "content": "This is because when you receive biased opinions and advice, the information you are receiving is often not as factual and more from the heart of what the person you are asking believes. This is why when asking only one person, you are more likely to find someone who is very biased. On the other hand, when you ask more than one person for the same advice, the odds are higher that you come across someone who is unbiased, and has probably done some research on the topic. An example that would show this is voting for an elected official using one persons advice verses voting an elected official using multiple peoples advice. On one side, using one persons advice can result in a much more simpler reason to vote for a official. This also allows for a lot less stressful voting process as you do not have to compare different candidates. However, using multiple people means it is more likely that you will get more unbiased results. This also means that you can kind of figure out what the general \"popular vote\" is, or in other words, what the general majority of people are voting. This example shows that asking one person for a solution does not always allow for the best solution because most of the time, you are not receiving unbiased opinions unless you ask multiple people.  If someone were to ask one hundred different people what their favorite food is, they would probably get 100 different answers. This can be applied to advice because, if someone were to ask several different people for advice, they could get completely different advice from different people, and, chances are, some of the advice can really help instead of giving the person that needs advice useless information floating around. For a moment, imagine that it's time to vote for the President, and person 1 has no idea of who to vote for.  So person one goes back to his/her good friend person 2, then asks, \"Person two, who are you voting for?\" Person two replies with his/her chosen candidate, and person one asks several other people, and finally, person four tells person one about the candidate that he/she has chosen, and person one also votes for that person, because from what person four said, that person will do great things as President. If person one had just asked person two who to vote for, he/she never would've known that person four had chosen the candidate that was right for person one's beliefs. Another benefit to getting multiple people's solutions is that the different advice can be applied to the same problem until something works. For example, person one is trying to fix that pesky flat tire on his/her car, and then the advice that person two and person three gave. Because person one can't get person four to help, because person four is on vacation in Norway, person one decides to apply the advice of person two and person three to see if something works, and it turns out that person two had good advice once person one figured out what person two was trying to say. Basically, multiple answers can lead to the best answer and many solutions can be applied to the same problem until something works.  If only one person is asked for advice, then there will be only one time where it is discussed. When multiple people are asked for advice, it will take up a longer amount of time, and will most likely be at different times and days. This is good because people can change their minds very quickly, and what someone thinks of their situation one day, might not be what they think of it the next day. When more people are asked for advice, all of the time it takes to ask them can be used to deliberate and decide which decision may be the best. When asking one person for advice, someone may only think of a solution to a problem over the course of one day. When asking multiple people, it could require someone to think of a solution for multiple days. This will make sure they think of all possible decisions and outcomes, so they don't make a spontaneous decision.  For example, if you lived in Texas. And you wanted to vote for John Kerry, you'd vote for a slate of 34 Democratic electoers. Witch in most cases would be O.K., but they could betray the party and vote for whom they please. It doesn't always happen but the possibility is real.\u00a0 And people, like the segregationists back in 1960, could have gone agenst their party and pick electors to go agenst Kennedy.  In one way, though rare, the electors may switch outlooks, and end up voting for the opposite candidate than whom they were voted, in turn, to vote for. Some even choose at random who they will vote for, regardless of who they were supposed to choose. Which then leads to the unfair decision for however many people he or she represented  It is very easy to cross someone's boundaries and get in trouble in the blink of an eye. This could happen frequently if you only have one opinion from one source or person.  What if you ask one friend for advice and their mad at the moment and they probably dont have your best interest in mind and you should get another opinion. I try not to ask mad friends for advise when possible.  You should ask multiple people because everyone dosent know whats best for you. My parents are the only people who know whats best for me.  Also your friends and peers dont always have your best interest in mind, sometimes they could give you bad advice to be funny. This happens to me all the time. This is my third reason why seeking more than one opinion can help you make a better choice.  It you have two opinions you will be able to see both sides of the problem therefore making it easier to for you to make the right choice. Having only one opinion is definitely worse than having multiple because you are unable to have the option to see the other side. The one opinion could lead you into making some wrong choices, yet have multiple will lead to make some of the better choices that you could have made. Having the most opinions possible could change your life for the better, and possibly make your life easier. Although, receiving multiple opinions could sound easy it is quite difficult, due to the fact that nit everyone is going to want to help you. Some people in our world will not want you to succeed. However one opinion is worse than having multiple because you are unable to see everything that could be harmful towards you.  Everyone has found themselves in that sticky situation where you just don't know what to do. There are so many problems running through your mind and so many ways to solve them. Your head is jumbled up, and you can't think straight anymore. You start stressing out and sweating and you just have absolutely no idea what do to!  In this scenario most people go to their friends and family for help. They ask as many people as they can to give them advice to help them make the best choice.  An example would be, a friend of yours pulls a ruthless prank on you. Instead of laughing along with your friend, you become upset and infuriated. You make a split second decision to retaliate. Several people encourage you to inform your friend that their actions bothered you, rather than getting even. Hearing the same thing from several people can often affect the way we view a topic. Rather than repeating those infuriating actions towards your friend, you explain to that individual that you were offended and deeply upset by their prank. When we decide in our minds that something negative is a good idea, or our only option, hearing differently from multiple people with our best interest at heart becomes a deciding factor in the choices we make daily.

                "content": "Overall, Policy 1 is a better policy because it still allows students to sometimes contact others with their cell phones. Today, cell phones are used by the majority of Americans multiple times. To take away their cell phones wouldn't be right. In some situations, students need them to call or text others to help them for whatever. Policy 1 works best because they have the chance to contact parents or friends when they need to, but they won't get distracted during class when they are turned off. This policy allows them to take care of anything they may need to, yet still be able to focus in class.  The last reason why I think you should choose Policy 1 is because students need to take a break from working constantly and make plans with friends  Students would rather go home and relax then to do an activity right after a long day. After school activities would ruin the students motivation to do anything. Students need a break from school. The perfect time for that would be after school hours. Allowing the student to have a time for themselves would let their brain relax and letting their body refresh. Students should allow themselves to have breaks after school, this wouldn't happen if students had to do a extracurricular.  When given the option to to stay at home to complete school, in opposition to going to school to complete school, nine out of ten students would agree in an instant to stay home. When further asking them their reasoning, the responses your most likely to receive consists of this : \"Im\u00a0going to go out and chill with my friends\", \"Im going to sleep in everyday\", \"im going to\u00a0go out shopping\", or flat out \"Im not going to do any work.\" The distance aspect of distance learning, when in the hands of people who initially didn't chose to go to school, will be full of procrastination and laziness. There can be measures applied to attempt to weed out the students that are straggling and try to help them develop better work habits, such as retake policies and extra help, but if a student doesn't care for what he or she is being told to work on, inevitably they will figure out a way around that work.  Students are in school at least 8 to 9 months or for some students all year around, so when it comes to summer break students are ready to relax, go on vacation, or just sleep. Students already have done tons of projects for classes or even just for one class and those projects are very stressful for some. Summer in a lot of cases are relax time and forget about school time so when they are given a project to do a lot would just put it to the side and dont do it at all. When coming up with ideas on what to do some will not know or just not even try that's why it think it should be teacher-base.  Because students are on vocations, this is their time to get caught up on their favorite hobbies and fun activities with their friends and one last thing they would want to think about is doing some sort of homework during their free relaxing time with family and friends moreover on a summer morning. For instance, lets say a student wants to hang out with friends on a saturday evening, but they remember they have a whole packet of work that was assigned to them before summer vocation and that by the end of summer before school starts, they have to finish it. The student will most liekly be worried and concerned about getting it over with and that means they will either cancell hanging out with friends and stay home doing random summer assigned homework on a saturday, but this is not the case when you know you are working with you teacher and that they will be able to walk you through all the work. Students surely worry less when they are working with a teacher on summer projects hence them doing something fun and relaxing in their free time sinc their teacher is available at any given point. School related projects or assignments are more easier to handle when your teacher is always there to work with you on that specific assigned assignment. As a result, students are much likely to enjoy their time away from school without anything bothering them for whatsoever case. Since students have already endured and served their time on the previous school year, they do not need any kind of aspect worrying them to the point where they have to stay home rather than them having fun and enjoying themselves and having a good time on a summer beach day while having fresh air and cooling off. Therefore, summer projects should be teacher-designed since students are not getting overwhelmed with what they need complete, but rather having some fun time with their friends and telling jokes and laughing them off with their relatives and maybe their pets who knows.  In the morning, most students have a routine they follow. If they have an activity that begins 45 minutes before school, they have to rearrange their whole schedule. This can lead to them losing sleep, not getting a good enough breakfast, and generally under prepared\u00a0for school. If a student has an after school activity, this can change and shorten their routine. If they get home, do homework, play games for 2 hours, eat dinner, shower, and then go to sleep, an activity can limit these things to less games or enjoyable activities, not as much of a dinner, and the day being taken up by mostly homework. It can cancel their time to relax or have fun, and cause a routine change. It shouldn't be up to the school to choose a students after or before school life, and throw off their entire schedule.  Summer projects are a great way for students to stay sharp during their long hiatus from school. The summer should be a time for students to relax and explore their passions without having to worry about schoolwork too much. But they should still have a few projects to do over the break so when they get back to school in Autumn, teachers don't waste time reviewing material their students have already learned  Students should not be all closed up with nothing to do they should at least have an hour of fun in their school day at least twice a week there should be 2-3 hours of out side time to let their energy all out of their systems.  Summer is the time to relax and unwind from the stresses of the school year. It's a time of mornings spent sleeping in, afternoons laying out by the pool, and nights sleeping on the roof, counting the stars that gleam in the sky. That is why students look forward to summer break. As a result, schools should not contribute in reversing the association students make between summer break and enjoyment by assigning teacher-designed projects. With the intention of continual learning occurring over summer break, schools should allow projects to be student-designed. It gives students the chance to explore their passions and make new discoveries without any limitations. Teacher-designed projects only serve in holding students back from doing projects that truly hold meaning to them. Taking into consideration all of these factors, the most logical decision schools can make is having summer projects that are student-designed. This will allow students to have a good time in both the academic and non-academic part of their summer break.\u00a0 ",

                "content": "hovering  The second issue is safety. According to NASA, they have a solution for getting a spaceship to Venus carefully and safely. \"Imagine a blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the roiling Venusian landscape. Just as our jet airplanes travel at a higher altitude to fly over many storms, a vehicle hovering over Venus would avoid the unfriendly ground conditions by staying up and out of their way. At thirty-plus miles above the surface, temperatures would still be toasty at around 170 degrees Fahrenheit, but the air pressure would be close to that of sea level on Earth. Solar power would be plentiful, and radiation would not exceed Earth levels. Not easy conditions, but survivable for humans.\" (paragraph 5). NASA has a soultion for the safety issue that was recently brought to their attention. The people who want to go and explore Venus now believe that this is one of the final steps toward actually getting off of the ground. If NASA trains astronauts well enough, tries to simulate the conditions on Venus, and everything works well; there is noting holding them back.  Students could focus on a sports team and how they network their team to different audiences in different ways. For example, mascots are normally focused on the younger audience. Teams almost always have a promotion for the first certain number of people that arrive. The first one thousand people to go through the security gates get a free t-shirt or the first fifty fans to arrive get a jersey. Marketing and understanding how to focus products to a certain group of people is so important. My dream school, Virginia Tech, has promotions every basketball game that if the opposing team misses two free throws in a row the entire crowd gets a voucher for free bacon. This encourages all Hokie fans to be as loud as possible to mess with the mental mindset of the opposing teams shooter. A majority of jobs and careers that are pursued must have a way of marketing or selling their product so this is a very important skill for kids to have that they would not other wise be able to understand if they had to read a Shakespeare book followed by a five pager paper.  Although each day, more and more opportunities to develop and improve technology and learning are created, sometimes these brilliant innovations do not mesh well with education. Despite the proposed effectiveness this software can serve for marketing companies, Facial Action Coding System would only produce obstacles to a student's learning process, ultimately diminishing any value it could potentially possess in a classroom.  Many people make their living off selling cars, advertising cars, building cars, designing cars, and even workers for car companies like Subaru, Toyota, Ford, Chevy, and more. On the radio, drivers hear tons of car sales and ads. If all the companies, all the advertisements, all the sales, all the new disigns, and every last car builder were to have to cope with driverless cars, many citizens would be out of a job.  They are considering a blimp-like vehicle that would float above the suface of Venus to meet the challenges presented. This blimp would avoid the poor conditions of the Venusian landscape by floating some thirty miles above the surface. Conditions around the blimp would still be slightly hot, but the pressure and toxicity would be similar to that on Earth. These conditions are not ideal, but they would be sufficient enough to study Venus further. Another one of NASA's ideas is to use mechanical computers to study Venus. These mechanical computers do not require electronics, and they would be more resistant to the poor conditions of the surface. These new innovations in the study of Venus is what makes the dangers tolerable and the study worthy.  Although I have many positive qualities, I am known to take the easy route when it comes to a lot of things. In my fifth grade science fair we were allowed to decide our own experiments to do. Instead of trying to think of a topic that may attract viewers at my booth, or something that interested me, I chose the most basic experiment I could think of, \"which paper airplane would fly the farthest.\" When it comes to school students are prone to rush through any work given. Like myself, they'd take the easy route and limit their own capabilities.  You know all those tall buildings built in the city? Yeah, those took many minds to make, over 1,000 engineers worked on the worlds tallest building. What if only one engineer made the design plans? I bet you it wouldn't even get past the drawing board. Everyone has heard the \"We're stronger together\" or \"Team work makes the dream work.\" Now, do you know everything about airplanes? I bet not, so that's why you would talk to someone that does know something about planes. 99% of engineers need someone else to work for them because they don't know something. See, that's a perfect example of a way that we need other people to help us by using their knowledge that they have and that we don't. But overall everyone is better together and not better divided.  They write about NASA wanting to know as much as possible about one of our closest neighbors, but don't give enough reasons as to why it's worth it. With acidic atmospheres ripping through machinery, technologies don't stand a chance on the Venusian surface. With the science that we have, the most we can hope for is a jet-like expirience, flying several miles above surface so that the pressure doesn't crush us instantly. Venus is additionally prone to constant volcanoes, earthquakes, and storms deadly enough to take out machinery. Given all this information, it seems like the author is trying to deter us from missions to Venus instead of promoting it, as they planned.  \"Hey Generic_Name should i get Space Defenders 4 or Battle for the Netherlands 2?\" Generic_Name asked. \"Is that even a question?\" Generic_Name replied, \"Get Space Defenders 4 man, the company for Battle for the Netherlands 2 is corrupted, they keep making the game more and more expensive!\" \"Whoa\u00a0whoa\u00a0whoa\u00a0stop right there!\" Generic_Name interrupted, \"The makers of Battle for the Netherlands are making the game more expensive because they're getting lots of sales and want to make more profit! It's simple economics Generic_Name!\" \"Thanks Generic_Name! I'll take that into consideration when I'm deciding!\" Generic_Name replied. Seeing the bigger picture allows you to see where a company or person might be getting their reasoning from when they make what seems to be a bad decision. When taking that extra info into consideration it allows you to understand the consequences of taking the other choice that might be more risky. With school laptops and computers, it might seem ridiculous the schools are getting such slow computers, but in fact they get them early so that they can last a long time and save a lot of money on technology for the years to come.

                "content": "the United States needs to keep the Electoral College instead of the popular vote because you will always have an outcome and one region can't overpower another and make a candidate win the presidental campaign. Yes, as said before many people want to get rid of the Electoral College but it will stay with the United States and move forward with us people.  The voters are left with an unfair outcome at almost every election because of the Electoral Collage. The votes can either be very close or the people could miss Ads or campaigns for canidates, leaving the people with nothing and confusion all over. Even if you knew what elector you voted for, you cant necessarily pick who it is your voting for and your vote could possibly get confued giving you a bad outcome. Most elections are just slid by and are just based on what ever the Electoral College thinks should happen. So please abolish the Electoral College its is irrational and is not neccessary, let the people really have a fair chance.  All and all, the Electoral College is the best way for voting. With this system, there are many benefits to the election process that people may not realize. With benefits like it avoids run-off elections and it makes the voters more aware, some people still beleive that a popular vote is still the best way. It is important to remember that there is a reason that we have certain methods, to benefit our country. And that is what the Electoral College is, a benefit to our country. So senator, and based on the evidence given, it is important to keep the Electoral College for all the benefits it brings and for the sake of our great nation that we live in.       In conclusion, I strongly feel that we need to change to an election by popular vote.\u00a0 Above all, it is more fair to the people.\u00a0 Citizens would feel that their votes matter more than they do now.\u00a0 People wouldn't have to be worried about if the electors would flip on what they had voted for.\u00a0 Although some say its is absolutely fair throughout all the states, there are still the set backs that come along with keeping an Electoral College.\u00a0 I agree with former presidents, Nixon and Carter, that we need to abolish the Electoral College.\u00a0 All of these reasons show you the problems there are with the current system of electing our President and I know you will agree  If I had a choice between keeping the Electoral College or a popular Vote, I would pick a popular vote cause the Electoral College is pretty crashed and it really fair. I say give people a chance and let them vote.\u00a0 Picking a pedigree plurality of votes from the Electoral College then from the Popular votes isnt fair based on us. No voters vote swings a national election,and in spite of that,about one-half the eligible American population did vote in the election of 2012,as said in pharagraph 23. I think that Voting for the popular vote would be better then Electoral College cause it would be the states vote instead of just a majority of peoples vote that only want a president that is not validated for success for us.  In conclusion, the Electoral college is beneficial to the people and a wise idea. The people in the entire country are never going to unanimously agree on anything. Keeping the Electoral college is not only wise, but a safe way to ensure that voting doesn't go wrong, and that the people\u00a0 always get a fair say in government matters.       \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0       \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  For my conclusion this proves that there are many difficulties along the way of an election, regarding the votes and voters. With this letter being written, people should not wonder whether or not the electoral college should be abolished, and go with the popluar voting method. You shouldn't be thinking about just a couple of people, but of a whole nation and deciding who is worthy enough in our eyes to lead us to more victories with the popular voting method.     The first reason is Certainty of Outcome. This means \"it's less likley than a dispute over the popular vote.\" Which really means the candidates share to the other people in the Electoral college there share of the popular vote and thats how they vote. The second reason is Everyone's President. This is basically shows that \"the Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal.\" This means that no region such as south,northwest,etc. has enough electoral votes to elect a president. The third resone to keeping these methods is Swing States. This tells me that its the \"winner takes all method.\" The fourth method why we should keep these methods is the Big States. This explains that \"the Electoral College restores some of the wieght in the political balance.\" this means that the bigger states get a big advantage in the electoral because the people that get elected into office there is based off of population so they have an advantage. THe bigger states get more attention from the candates then the smaller states do. The final reason why we should keep this method of voting is Avoid Run-Off Elections. This means \"the Electoral College aviods the problem of Elections in which no candidates recieves a majority of the votes cast\". This means no pressure for candidates when they win majority of the votes cast.  How are we supposed to trust these electors if we dont even know who they are and their background until after the election? Who even are these electors i wondered. I figured out that all the electors are actually anyone with a brain and not holding a public office, fantastic. So how do i know they are reliable and going to do whats best for my state and our country? Voters dont even control whom their electors vote for most of the time which is kind of scary. Some electors are even faithless in their party's canidate so they dont even vote for them at all! How can we rely on a group of people who dont rely on their party?  In essence, the Electoral College is necessary for the balance and order in the United States to remain. It provides a fair representation and campaign for all regions, allows votes from states with fewer population numbers to have significance, and avoids the issue of trying to determine the president when neither receives the majority vote. This all shows that fewer problems arise when using this procedure, rather than if they use majority vote. \"You help choose your state's electors when you vote for President because when you vote for your candidate you are actually voting for your candidate's electors.\" This shows that the citizens still have power in choosing their candidate and it creates a balance with other parties. In conclusion, the Electoral College should be kept to preserve the integrity and equality the United States is all about.    ",

                "content": "In the article \"Driverless Cars Are Coming,\" the author presents both positive and negative aspects of cars that drive themselves. Although, there are bountieous reasons why driverless cars are a good thing, there are also myriads of reasons as of why this could also be a bad thing.  With the positives, though, it is not enough for the driverless car to save someone's life. It does not have the technology to avoid other drivers. And, driverless cars will never cancel the use of regular cars because not everyone will trust them. Driverless cars will create controversy, just as the passage brought up \"Whose fault is it in an accident? The cars or the drivers?\"  Driverless cars are coming, and they are going to be dangerous. Driverless cars are coming and they stilll have a lot of issues to work through that could be dangerous. Driverless cars are going to reward the lazy for being lazy, and make them have to do even less work. Taking away the need for human drivers in vehicles will take away great memories, fun adventures, and many valuable skills that peple can gain while driving a car. These cars also can cause many safety issues including accidents from the lack od the cars ability to handle certain situations and could also cause issues if the drivers of these cars fall alseep when there is a sitiuation where there is a need for a human driver. RIght now these cars do not have enough safety features and they do not have enough driving capability to be safe for public use. If the manufactoring companies continue to work on these cars and make improvements, then these cars might not be completely bad, but as of right now they are not safe enough or skillled enought to be sent out to the pubic.  Section eight of the passage focuses on the psychological aspects of driverless cars, and introduces thd idea of laziness and boredom in human nature. Later on, the author states that some manufacturers hope to address this problem by including entertainment in the cars to remedy this boredom. Bringing in car entertainment wuld only further distract the now obsolete human drivers from the road, which in the case of an emergency, could prove fatal to not only the driver, but the passengers in the car as well. The Google car mentioned in section 7 \"Announces when the driver should be prepared to take over\". If the human did not hear the car announce this, and the car was reverted to the drivers control, the driver might end up in a crash.  The article \"Driverless Cars Are Coming\" speaks about how traffic laws are currently written to include human control of the vehicle in Paragraph 9. Furthermore, it talks about how limited the allowance of testing is. With a large scale rejection of such ideas it is wise to consider the fact that there is not just assumptions made by everyone. The article blatantly puts down the states who did not follow suit in allowing the tests. There was not any consideration of the majority possibly deciding this based on solid fact and the issues not yet addressed by the companies manufacturing the vehicles. So, the legality of the driverless cars is merely one point amongst a plethora of other issues.  Driverless Cars Are Coming is a short article that depicts the use of computerized cars that are being made. The cars are supposed to be safe and trustworthy. One part of the article describes a public-transport taxi system that would take people from place to place, navigating through other driverless cars. The idea of this self controlling, moving car can be very advantageous to people, using less fuel, prevent or stop car accident, and take people to their destination at ease. However, there are issues with the automated automobile. How will driverless cars adapt with cars with actual drivers? How will everyone acquire the self-driving car when they could cost fortunes? Also who is blamed if and when prevented accidents aren't prevented? Lastly what about car computer hacking?  My first piece of evidence for this is that driverless cars are machines, and despite having a notoriously bad reputation for failing at times due to some error during the design process, machines do not tire and do not grumble about watching their surroundings; they also need not be perfect, only better than a person to become favorable as a driver. My second piece of evidence comes from, once again, \"Driverless Cars Are Coming\" when it was stated that \"enetertainment and information systems that use heads up displays [...] can be turne doff instantly when the driver needs to take over [in the case that the car senses that its own computing devices are not enough to handle a situation]\". This system appealed to me a lot due to how intuitive it is; if a person shouldn't be using something, it turns off, no questions asked. All of these factors further lead me to believe that cars are \"the way of the future\".  Driverless cars will be of little entertainment interest to people. Drivers would \"get bored waiting for their turn to drive,\" (Driverless Cars Are Coming).  a life without cars means a healthy, long-lasting planet along with a happy, relaxed, and healthy population. Even though cars are conveint, they have many negative side effects. Next time you want to go for a ride, think of all the benefits of limiting them. Rember what a breath of fresh air feels like because the gasses from cars might mean they will be gone soon. Get used to angry faces honking horns, and being given \"the bird\" by angry drivers because with cars come many conveiniences, but also many frustations.     First, driverless cars can drive at ease when other driverless cars are in uniform with the other cars, but when one car has someone drivng the car then the driverless cars aren't able to predict the outcome the real driver will make.

If all cars or vehicles were to stop being used the air would clear easily and we can all live in clear air. \"The smog cleard enough Monday for the ruling French party to rescind the ban for odd-numbered plates on Tuesday\"(Duffer, \"Paris bans driving due to smog\"). If they made like a schedule for which days cars will be banned and what days aren't, then the air we breathe will be better than ever and everyone will still be able to use there cars how they feel like.  In \"In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars\", author Elisabeth Rosenthal shares the story of Vauban, Germany and their efforts to reduce greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. \"Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emmisions in Europe...and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States.\" The impact of these gas emmsions is incredibly negative on cities. They make the environment unstable and unsafe for a large number of people. These numbers could easily be reduced if fewer people chose to rely on cars as their mode of transportation. In some places the pollution caused by automobiles is so high that the government is stepping in to assist in the management of city spaces. In \"Paris bans driving due to smog\", author Robert Duffer explains this specific situation in Paris, France. \"After days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city. On Monday motorists with even-numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22-euro fine ($31). The same would apply to odd-numbered plates the following day.\" The effects of this temporary ban were also shared. \"Congestion was down 60% in the capital of France, after five-days of intesifying smog.\" It is easy to see that just a small reduction of vehicles created a significant change.  Cars also cause poulltion and smog to hang over cities causing the air to be full of harmful chemicals, endagering peoples health and also causing a rise in asthma for the populace that lives inside the city. In places like Beijing,China smog and poulltion from cars cause the air to be so foggy and dirty that you cannot even see the sky. \"Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city.\"(Source 2). When Paris was accosted by the same problem they solved it by a temporary ban on driving to clear the air. Without so many people driving cars we wouldn't have these many issues with smog and it's effect on the enviroment.  Due to citizen's of Bogota, Paris, and Germany not using cars and having to switch to bikes, walking, and electric bikes; has greatly reduced toxic gases in the environment. Due to individulas in Paris not excessively using cars the amount of smog has reduced. According to Robert Duffer \" after days of near-record pollutions, paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city( Paris bans driving due to smog 10).\" Paris has enforced strict rules that rejects people from driving, also a switch to diesel fuels. In return these ideas have lowered the level of smog in Paris creating a cleaner environment for the citizen. Not only has Paris help reduce toxic gases from entering our environment, but so has Bogota. In the article Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota, Andrew Selsky stated that this has been Bogota's \"thrid year straight that cars have been banned for one day\" and the only motorized vehicles they have used are \"buses\". This switched has dramatically cut traffic, rush hour, and the amount of smog left in the air. Although there is still traces of pollution after this day it has lowered.  \"Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe...and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States\", Rosenthal writes in \"In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars\". By driving less, we can reduce our greenhouse gas emissions. \"Paris bans driving due to smog,\" by Robert Duffer, is a prime example of the reduction of air pollution after limiting car usage. \"After days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city\", writes Duffer. One Friday, the smog of Paris \"rivaled Beijing, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world\". On the following Monday, motorists with even-numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a $31 fine. After only one day with less cars on the roads, the smog had nearly dissappeared. This shows that even a day with less cars can make a huge difference in the amount of air pollution. Rosenthal's article, \" The End of Car Culture\", states that many sociologists believe that if the pattern of less cars continues, \"it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment\" because transortation is America's second largest sourse of carbon emissions. Less air polution is a very important advantage of less cars.   In my town getting your license is a huge deal. As soon as I turned fifteen I went streight to the DMV to take my test and get to driving as soon as possible. In countries and cities such as Germany, France, and Bogota, driving is ban pretty much where ever you go. After days of near-record pollution,paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city and as a result congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five-days of intensifying smog. Smog flooded Beijing, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the entire world.  \"After days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city.\" (Duffer 10). This states that the air has been getting so polluted that some cities have been temporarily banning the use of cars because of this issue. Earth has been getting too polluted and destroyed lately, to the point that some people have been trying to predict an \"end is nigh\" date due to all of these issues with earth. Scientists have been talking about global warming for years now, and the problems we have been having with the greenhouse effect and the ozone layer. \"President Obama's ambitious goals to curb the United States' greenhouse gas emissions, unveiled last week, will get a fortuitous assist from an incipient shift in American behavior: recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by.\" (Elisabeth Rosenthal 29). So it seems that the lower use of cars by Americans has been helping the atmosphere and postponing the date of the complete destruction of the ozone layer. That was why cars have such a big impact on the environment as a whole.  By limiting the amount that the citizens of the United States operate their vehicles, the condition of our environment's atmosphere will improve.\u00a0 As stated in Source 1, \"and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States.\"\u00a0 This passage is referring to the amount of greenhouse gas emitted here in America because of passenger cars.\u00a0 By not using car and taking advantage of other methods of transportation such as buses, walking, and riding a bike that number can be reduced significantly.\u00a0 In the United States we are also learning from mistakes made by other countries and cities.\u00a0 \"After days of near-record pollution,\" Source 2 says, \"Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city.\"\u00a0 A lesson can be taken from Paris of how we do not want to end up in a situation like that.\u00a0 By limiting our driving currently we can avoid having to take major steps to clean and clear our environment.\u00a0 \"It will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment, since transportation is the second largest source of America's emissions, just behind power plants,\" a sociologist predicts in Source 4.  Passenger cars are rsponsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States (Source 1). Not many people think about the effects of air pollution like smog, but it is a big deal. Since people don't think about it often, there is no way for the majority of us to try and find a solution to put into action to stop it or help it go down. In Paris, there was a partial driving ban to clear the air around the city (Source 2). Paris' partial ban was their idea to try and make their city a better place. With the ban being enforced and put into play there\u00a0 were about 4,000 drivers fined (Source 2). It turns out that since the driving ban was made the congestion, car traffic, had gone down 60 percent in the capital of France, just after five days of less smog pollution and Paris is typically known to have more smog than any other European capitals (Source 2). This goes to show, that slowly people are actually becoming aware of what's going on and they actually care enought to try and make things better.  After suffering through days of near-record pollution, Paris, France had composed a temporary driving ban in an attempt to clear the air, according to Rober Duffner in \"Paris Bans Driving due to Smog\". The passage goes further to explain that the ban followed five days of smog that rivalled the likes of Beijing, China, which is widely recognized for being one of the most polluted cities in the world. Exceptions to the ban were made for hybrids and cars carrying three or more passengers, and public transportation was made to be free. Once the smog cleared enough, the ban was lifted and citizens were allowed back to the road, but the reduction of auto usage was what saved the air from becoming overly polluted. Moreover, in Bogota, Colombia, citizens participate in a car-free day, entitled Day Without Cars, once a year to reduce smog in the cities, according to \"Car-free Day is Spinning Into a Big Hit in Bogota\" by Andrew Selsky. Violators are charged with $25 fines, but, according to Bogota Mayor Antanas Mockus, the people participate, and the turnouts are large. This day without cars, which has begun to spread to other Colombian cities, is a fantastic way to reduce both air pollution and stress, and is a part of a campaign to oversee the construction of 118 miles of bicycle paths, which, according to Mayor Mockus, is the most of any city in Latin America.

                "content": "Individual car use isn't bad. Millions of individuals using cars, however, is very bad. Note the emphasis. Even just making a concious effort to car pool, bike to work or school, use public transportation, or use some sort of alternative transportation could be enough to clear up the air of some of it's emissions, keep oneself and others happier and less stressed, save time and money, and improve their city all in one little decision. It's just a matter of going ahead and doing it, so what is stopping anyone from going out and making that change now? Be the change you want to see and limit your car usage now.   Cars are a great invention but it is not necessary for every individual to have one. Walking and biking are better alternatives. The use of cars has gone through the roof creating problems around the world. A healthy environment for our children and grandchildren is what we imagine. One does not think of using a car as damaging to the enviornment until after they have done it. Limiting car usage would turn the world into a healthier, stress reduced place. For these reasons I think it would be of best interest to try and find other alternatives to driving as much.\u00a0       \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  not using cars is better for the environment  Another thing that has been changed due to the limitation of car usages is that with individuals not having to buy a car, pay for insurance, and pay for gas, it\u00a0 has increased the amount of money citizens have in their wallets. Citizens of the United States of America have not exactly chosen to not use cars, but some have, the main reason Citizen of America have limited themself is due to a lack of money. During our \"recession\" Americans were \"unemployed\" and \"unable to pay (The end of car culture 32).\" Because citizens were not able to pay for cars, they did not use them, thus as you get adapted to a new situation you tend to stay with it. After the switch citizens who chose to continue a life without a car, were able to have more money because they didnt have to pay for the cost that come with a car.  Cars can be useful in many ways but for the better of the enviorment, peoples cities, and sanity, little to no car use is the way to go.       \u00a0  The majority of Americans have the luxury of owning a car. A car of course, seems like a useful innovation. It gets you places quickly and efficently, and is easier than walking. Yet so many people drive cars that the roads get congested and clogged easily as the cars just idle in the road waiting for the traffic jam to loosen up. Car usage causes the enviroment to decline and an increase in air poulltion,  Although cars seem like a material object that is so precious to life, it's not. In all reality people can live a life without cars, citizens in Bogota, Paris, and Germany have, and they enjoy it. Its time to make a switch and make a helpful change in your lifestyle. A life without cars is very benefitial, it is less stressful, lowers pollution, and has an increases of money. Although not using cars is a bit extreme, you can always make a better switch to using electric products, which can also help lower the amount of toxic gases in the air. Gas car's that produce extreme levels of gases are a thing of the past, I believe its time to move to the future.       \u00a0     All in all, there are many ways to try and cut down on our car usage for the better. It can be anything from not buying as many cars, to deciding to not use cars at all and deciding to walk, skate, and bike, etc. Not only will limiting our car usage as a whole stop traffic jams, car accidents, air pollution, and more, it will help to benefit our lives for the better whether or not people want to believe it. If things keep going from here, and more and more decide that less car usage is better than over a time span of let's say 20-30 years, there could be a lot less dangerous things occuring in our lives.     Cars, both the rose and the thorns in a community and enviroment, can be both benificial and harmful to people, depending on who you are. For most regular pedeastrians and citizens within a city, less cars means less pollution, traffic, and stress. Unless you are a business owner of a car dealership or working for a delivery company, limited car usage means very postive things for social relationships, health, the enviroment, and general living conditions of a busy city. The less harmful emissions of gases from cars could greatly affect the outcome of our clean, energy efficient future.       \u00a0     In conclusion, cars are a hiderance. Cars are stressful and cumbersome objects, getting rid of them would help reduce stress in the population. Cars are high contributers to pollution, creating smog and causing problems. Also, cars are a comodity that is being used less and less. People are putting down the car keys and picking up a bike. So why not join the trend? ",

                "content": "Some people don't care about their community . That's why people say it takes up to much time because they are being lazy . Helping out the community should be something fun and it doesn't matter how much time it takes up . If its boring to you get a friend to come along with you and help out . The more help the better .  Everybody needs to know that our world needs to get better and cleaner. Littering is probably the worst thing out there that you can do. Something needs to change because when you just walk outside of your house there's a piece of trash and you can help by just picking that piece up. If you could get all the students doing community service then those students could inspire other students or even their brothers, sisters or even their own parents. If just one person could help pick up a little trash then imagine what ten or even fifty people could do this world would be better in no time if everybody could just pitch in a little of there time everyday by making the world a little better.  The adults always get mad when the kids are skateboarding through the mall and are almost hitting people. If they do the community service the adults will like the kids more because they are helping out the community. The kids also look up to older kids. For example, if they see an older kid picking up garbage of the road or even just a brother they will want to be big like them and do the same thing as them.  This is because they are constantly helping people out, and doing the right thing. This way they will feel good about themselves, and will be a better person overall. I am a boy scout, and i always participate in activities such as, help cleaning up a state park, and help cleaning up the Connecticut River. After i do these things, i feel ready good about myself because i did the right thing, and helped out our community a lot. Furthermore, scientist have shown that students who do community service have a better chance of having a happy life than people who don't, because you will always feel good about yourself and how you have helped your community.  and they will think ''Well they seem to care about there town to help out this much '' and by them knowing that you did this to help you will look good to them. Which in the long shot you will look better, then some of the others. Not just helping you out with collage or a job but skills in life. You might have learned something while doing your community service that helps you out when in a tough predicament that you come across.  That way kids would feel like their making a change and getting rewarded that's a great feeling. Some kids think community service is dumb and gross because you have to pickup trash. But if kids get rewarded they will strive to help in their community and stop trash build up on the freeways and out in front of their own houses little thing will start to build up and make kids want to do big things like go to other countries in need of help and help out with them like in Haiti were there is still a lot of rubbish all around. Kids and adults can help out every where there is need of help from the state of Ohio to all across America and then the whole world!   But by doing community services each of us is doing something subsidiary. I think if we all do this we can make our community a better place to live in and i assure your that after doing so many good and helpful things toward others, in the end you will feel and be a better person.  Helping out seniors in homes is a great way to help others that after so long of hard working now need a way to know they did a great job in their life and that they're being appreciate. Doing some garden help might be a big mess but it's a great way to help the community out, even at a school. Another good way of helping a student is to have them help those in need, which helps them be thankful for what they have and to not give up on their goals. I am not only saying this for the good of others, I am also saying this with experience, not only from myself but other friends of mines that have changed from the help of doing community service for their school or for another requirement.  For example if you live by a beach, and there is a lot of garbage, and no one helps pick it up, it can kill the poor harmless animals that might think its food. But if you have all the students help by doing community service it will all get cleaned and we can make sure there are no pieces left behind.  What would happen if after a while no one took care of our community? For an example It's like taking care of your room, what if one day you decided not to put things in there proper places and just threw things anywhere and left it untidy? It might begin to smell, or you might even discover things missing. So taking care of our community is like taking care of own self. Doing this could be a really good deed, giving back to the community to make it a healthier place. For example, maybe we can go 2-3 times a week picking up trash, even just starting with our own football field. ",

When talking about something as dangerous as exploring another planet, it is easy to see that our Earth bound technology simply cannot do the job. in paragraph 5 of the article, the author describes an idea that was thought up by \"The National Aeronautics and Space Administartion\". This idea is to have humans 30 or so miles above Venus for exploration. The author claims how this would be beneficial in keeping humans safe from the Venusian landscape. However, The author does not support this idea well, as he goes on to say how not much exploration can be done from there, and the conditions would still be extremely dangerous but \"survivable\". Also in paragraph 7, the author explains how NASA is working on other approaches to study Venus. He explains how they are working on some simplified electronics, made of silicon carbide, that have been testedd in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface. This may sound like a good thing, but it is far from one. This is because the author finsihes by saying that the electronics lasted only three weeks. If a computer can't withstand Venus's conditions longer than three weeks, I am very doubtful that a human can. This proves my point that our technology is far too inadvanced for such a task like exploring another planet. Therefore supporting my claim that the author did a poor job in supporting this idea.  On the first day of  Summer Break one is thinking about all the things he's going to be doing, like:relax all day, go on vacation, hang out with friends or family, play video games, and do non-school related things. Suddenly, he or she gets an email from their teacher saying,\"I hope everyone is enjoying summer so far, over the summer you will have to do a project on what you have learned this year.\" At the end of the email is the instructions the teacher says you have to do for your project. After reading the email one closes his laptop or turns off his phone with anger, because that one teacher ruined his summer.  How are people supposed to enjoy their summer break when a teacher gives them school-related stuff to do. Some teachers complain all the time about them having to grade all types of work when a student doesnt do his work. Teachers shouldn't complain because,all they had to do is not give students any work especially over the summer. Then that will make the teachers job way much easier, because they won't have much stuff to grade and worry about planning to do.  In the article, the author continously offers alternatives for exploration. He does this is paragraphs' 5,6, and 7 where he gives examples of organizations that are working towards this exploration. However in all of the paragraphs, the author seems to only be giving \"what if\" scenarios or in some cases just simple ideas that have been thought about and are possibly being examined. He fails to provide any real data or statistics for these things, except when he mentions the simplified electronics in paragraph 7. Even then, those devices are only able to survive for 3 weeks, so it would still take many years to just improve those devices. Also, in paragraph 6 the author states, \"Many researchers are working on innovations that would allow our machines to last long enough to contribute meaningfully to our knowledge of Venus\". This statement is very broad, and it does not key in on any form of information that should lead us to believe that to be true. These details from the passage prove my point on the amount of years it would take, as well as the fact that nobody has any idea how long. The question to be asked here is, \"Is it worth the wait?\". For these reaons I stand behind my claim that the author supported the idea of exploring venus very poorly.   But some kids think that it is just a waste of time and they say that they have more important things to do.  When discussing the potential plans to explore the planet, the author states \"Many researches are working on innovations that would allow our machines to last long enough to contribute meaningfully to our knowledge of Venus.\" This quote makes it clear to the audience that scientists are doing whatever it takes to develop multiple, efficient plans for space travel. The author also goes onto provide different examples to further convey how close scientists are to developing the safest plan possible. They specifically mention the use of simplified electronics made of silicon carbide and explain how they've already been tested in a chamber that simulate the conditions of Venus's surfaces, yet how they're still being improved upon. They also describe an old technology called mechanical computer, noting how this technology has already been used frequently in the 1940's and how it can be incorporated into space travel now. The author has given detailed descriptions of the efforts made and the options available to provide a safe embarkment for humans to support the ideas that Venus is a worthy pursit.  They might have gone through the same thing in the past and know how to handle it. I feel a sense of relief to know that they understand what I am going through. If you are talking to a friend they will most likely already know about the situation and can help you out more than you think. Depending on how much they know, you'll have a clear understanding of what happened and feel comfortable enough to make a good decision. Another way you can get more knowledge is figuring out how you can prevent this from happening again in the future. That is something\u00a0you're gonna need! Getting advice from someone who already knows about the problem, has dealt with the same thing in the past, and keeping the advice for the future are perfect reasons why you should seek advice from not just one person, but a few.   Lastly, modern day technology is known for its speed and cinvenience to access information. In paragraph 7, the author discussed how electronics we simplified to last at least three weeks in simulating conditions to Venus. He explained, \"modern computers...tend to be more delicate when it comes to extreme physicakl conditions.\" He supported this claim by informing readers that older technology, mechanical computers, have been re-evaluated and seem to have better calculations but involve levers and such.  Overall this article's information and research was great and really did inform me about the planet, but the conclusion ruiened it all. The whole time (paragraphs 1-7) the author lead all the readers to believe that going to Venus has too many dangers and isnt in our best interest, yet the conclusion stated that going to Venus would be a great oppurtunity and that \"Our travels on earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation\". If the passage had evidence all throught that going to Venus is beneficial, it would be a perfect article but i was all around confused when I found out the author was all for going to Venus and it ruiened and confused the whole article.           While talking about different approaches to studying Venus the author states, \"...simplified electronics...have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface and have lasted for three weeks...\". This quote also helps the reader understand that studying Venus can be done in a safe and harmless way. Using this new technology could help research on Venus advance, and keep those doing the research out of harm's way. The author then goes on to talk about a different technology that was used in World War 2 that can also be used as a new method to study Venus. These are called mechanical computers, and they use gears and levers rather than the electronics that actual computers use. The mechanical computers are made of mechanical parts which are stronger, so they shouldn't be damaged as easily. These are just a few of the ways technology can help safely advance the study of Venus.  ",

The camera on board MGS had to peer through wispy clouds to see the face and perhaps alien markings were hidden by haze. Also NASA can be hidding information about the Face. But, you can see that the Face is formed by shadows, and not an alien haze.  some people still weren't convinced. They said that the picture was taken on a cloudy winter day, so many skeptics thought that maybe there were alien markings that were just hidden by haze.  the only reason the natural landform even remotely looked like a face was because of shadows.  During july 1976 it would have been winter on mars at the time. So that means the storms on mars could have casted a shadow.  After scientists did a little research on their own, \"The Face\" turned out to actually be a messa that is common around the american west.  The day the photo was taken was in winter. It says in paragraph 8 that, \" ... it was winter in April '98- a cloudy time of year on the Red Planet.\" These facts show that the landmass could indead be hidden by clouds. However, NASA still supported their claim that it was just a misinterpreted natural landform.  The author also stated in paragraph seven that in 1998 that the photo was retaken with a higher quality camera.  The Face Theorists weren't satisfied with it being just a landform and tried to find evidence to prove NASA wrong.  The Face Theorists found out that the location and date of the April '98 photo was during a cloudy winter.  Skeptics said that the alien markings were hidden by the haze.  Even though the picture clearly showed that the Face wasn't a man-made structure,  Three years later we recieved the best results possible. the photo not only showed no carvings but it also showed that there was no face at all!

                "content": "In article one, paragraph 8, there is something that the governor does that maybe is supposed to reassure us. \"After the presidential election, your governor prepares a \"Cerificate of Ascertainment\" listing all of the candidates who ran for President in your state along with the names of their respective electors.\"\u00a0 This is just them saying who was all voted for and who all ran. It also says who the electors were. They give us this probably just to notify us but maybe it's also an idea to make us think that Electoral College is proud to help us get who we want.  As said in the article, \"What Is The Electoral College?\", \"The Electoral College process consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for President and Vice President, and the counting of the electoral votes by Congress.\" That is a huge amount of work but that is what keeps the elections well organized. Each candidate running for President in a state has their own group of electors. After each election, the governor of your state prepares a certificate presenting all of the candidates that ran for your state. As stated in the article by the Office of the Federal Register, \"The Certificate of Ascertainment also declares the winning presidential candidate in your state and shows which electors will represent your state at the meeting of the electors in December of the election year.\" The Electoral College is what mantains everything professional.  In the article  What Is The Electoral College by the office of the Federal Register, it states that the election process is held every four years along with the after election prepared by the govenor titled \"Certificate Of Ascertainment\" which sums the canadidates and electors as well as the winning canadidate. It is obvious that the voters only know so much of what they vote for and do not really get a good taste of how the presidential canadidate is like. It can be clear that as a blind election, the voters have no hints of who they might be voting towards and in the end can cause a major catasrophe if a canadidate has very little intentions for the states. In agreement to the article the text  In the defense of the electoral college by Richard A. Posner it begins to sate the election of Romney who, by increasing his plurality and possesing only regional appeal, lost the peoples desire to vote for him thinking that the man has no regards for their interest and does not have any intentions of improving their needs or helping with creating a community where the people can rely on Romney. The actions taken began to change the thoughts of the citizens and create a petrifying conclusion that the man was not on the run to be everyone's president. This dilema could have been changed around if Romney had shown that he had cared more for his state and his country and thought more about the needs he could fill and the actions he could improve, then many of the voters would have most likely shown repsect and a desire for the man to be choosen as their new president. On the opposing hand Romney had not shown any of those qualities or passion which had caused for him to be thought of as unresponisble and selfish.  The country has more than thousands and thousands of people to serve and direct. It can be understood that having a large amount of citizens can result in uncertainty towards the election and the votes cast, yet it is yet to be changed to a more reasonable way of confronting it. With many systems such as \"Winner-Take -All\" due to states titled as the \"Swing States,\" it can be an untrustworthy election fo rmany voters around the country. The election process not only need to be changed to select a more responsible canadidate, but to create a more trustworthy system of itself.   In this case, the election would be thrown to the House of representatives, were delegates from each state would vote on the president. Since each state has only one vote to cast, a vote from a state containing 500,000 people would carry the same weight as a vote representing the opinions of 35 million. Given that many voters vote one party for president and another for Congress, the selection made by the House of Represenatives can hardly be expected to respesent the will of the people.     But,We the people do not have our justice in that manner.If the winning vote is casted by state the legislatures are techinally responsible for picking the eletors in favor of the vote.  It has recently come to my attetnion as I study our states voting system, that we as Americans do not have enough word in who we have as our leader. In a plethora amount of documents from the United States, and our Consitution it states all men are creted equal, when in all relaity we are allowing the Electoral College have more say in who our president rather than we do.  If Florida voted canidate A, but North Dakota voted for canidate B, canidate A is bound to win because Florida has twenty-nine representatives and North Dakota only has three. As you can see Mr. President, this becomes a preblem because four states with only three representatives could vote for one canidate, but if Florida votes for the other one, the first canidate has already lost.  In conclusion,\u00a0 the state senators should eliminate the electoral collge because they count the majorty votes, and don't count other votes that is not popular as the other candidates vote. also because they can decide vote on an canditate they want based on their opinions and beliefs. and lastly because of the winner takes it all system which is bascially taking the losing candidates electoral votes.     To the state and the state's country, the election of our president must be seen carefully and wisely. As the citizens of the state, people must realize that choosing someone to take control of orders and regulations and the way the country evolves, is a process that needs to be thought of and taken fairly. The president is to serve the people of his country well with responisbilities that can vary to meet the needs of the country,but the electoral college seems to become more and more unfair to those who vote.  When chossing a president remember that your one vote will not have a great effect on who is president but the electoral college does. Having both popular vote and electoral college vote will allow all citizen to be involed in the slection of your presient. Getting rid of it my allow more of the non congress citizen to have more of a say. The congress is part of our country to and they should be able to vote the way they want to.   ",

                "content": " First, the author brings up his topic of \" Studying Venus is a worhty pursuit despite the dangers it presents\". Despite this, the author only gave one full paragraph, out of the eight he wrote, on why humans would want to explore the planet ; he then preceeded to go onto the dangers of Venus, rather than why it is worth exploring.  The author does not suport his ideas well, because he draws the reader away from the topic many times, he doesn't support his thesis very well, and the evidence he does bring up are opinions or assumptions. The author provides to much on the \"danger\" aspect of it, and he should focus more on the \"why\" aspect of his idea . So, it would be best if he looked over his essay and ,with his thesis in mind, start over from scratch.  The first paragraph introduces the topic of Venus with an interesting hook, but does not give the reader their side. The reader needs a thesis, without one the reader is not going to be able to have their opinion on a topic swayed. The author's current attempt at a thesis statement , \"While Venus is simple to see from the distant but safe vantage point of Earth, it has proved very challenging place to examine more closely,\" does not state what side they are on clearly. Their best declaration of the side they are on is in their very last paragraph. The author wrote, \"Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation.\" This is a very strongly worded thesis, but would have been much better if placed in the starting paragraph. Their side on the topic was acknowledged, but not as well as it could have been if they had set up their thesis correctly.  The more compliments you receive, the more people who say they like the idea. Many famous writers used other people's thoughts to see whether or not their book is good, and they ask for their opinion. An example from me is my favorite series of books:  Gone Series.  On the front cover of the book, it has one quote from an author, and on the back there were many other quotes from other companies. Adding to the quotes, on the top of the book said  #1 New York best Selling Book , basically saying to new readers that this series is good and popular. That is usually why on the front cover or back cover of a book contains a quote from different people or companies showing their good opinion about this book, so the readers can see that since this person liked the book, then it must be a good book to read. Having an award on your book also brings in popularity because winning something like the Pulitzer prize can bring a ton of attention to your book. It can give you more to believe in that your project will be good because you have many people who say your project is good. Not just the people who say that it's just \"good\", but also the people who point out the things that they especially liked within your idea, such as, \"I liked how you included this part to make that huge problem go away.\" These kinds of compliments makes you feel even better inside, and it tells you that you can take your mind off that one part of the idea and imagine more possible problems.  Throughout reading this article I thought it provided very good and extensive research. Although I did see some major issues with the leading point of the passage. This author provided very good research but the research and evidence throughout the entire article controdicted their main message.  The author is aware of the fact and describes how, \"no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours\" (paragraph 2). Right off the bat, the author gives their audience the mindset that it is not a good idea to study Venus. Having that fact in the first few paragraphs of the article sets the tone for the rest of the article. In paragraph three, the author goes into great detail about several of the potential dangers that can come from studying Venus because of its, \"clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid\" (paragraph 3). The frightening environment described strays the audience even further away from believing that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers  From the very first descriptions of the idea the author is trying to bring across, the audience is turned away from the author's opinion. The tone set sways the audience toward one direction of the conflict while the author is in the other direction. The author went too far into detail about the dangers that can come from studying Venus and di not have evidence of how it would be safe and possible at all. The author's idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers was not supported through their ideas or evidence.          Furthermore, the author uses facts intended to continue to convince readers that Venus is dangerous, when this is exactly the opposite of what the author is arguing for. Making statements which invoke fear or apprehension only pushes the reader away from the topic, instead of influencing him or her to gain interest in it. For instance, when the author uses phrases with negative connotations, such as \"thick atmosphere\", \"corosive sulfuric acid\", \"800 degrees Fahrenheit\", and \"extreme\", they influence readers negatively as well.   The final reason is that the author brings up the challenges that NASA is facing in trying to get to Venus.  The author does a good job by using details to support that although this is a challenge, they are willing to dive deeper into studying this \"Evening Star\" known as Venus. ",

Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth\" (The Challenge of Exploring Venus). If Venus could've supported human life long ago, it is likely the planet still can. The scientific facts throughout this statement support the author's claim by having a reliable source of information, supporting the idea. Paragraph 4 reads, \"Today, Venus still has some features that are analogous to those on Earth. The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters\" (The Challenge of Exploring Venus). Venus already has Earth-like landscapes and other similar formations. This supports the author's idea of exploring Venus because it is so similar to Earth, the chances of survival are higher than any other planet.  As stated in the text, the conditons on the planet are \"far more extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth.\" Even with advanced technology that we have today, the article states that \"no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours.\" If the technology we have today can't even survive the conditions on Venus, how are humans supposed to be able to? Even though the author claims the conditions are \"not easy, but survivable for humans,\" the temperature can climb up to over 800 degrees Fahrenheit. These pieces of evidence from the excerpt convey the idea that Venus and its characteristics are far too dangerous for humans to even go near.  In Paragraph 4, the author states, \"Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system.\" If this is true, then could Venus become like Earth once again?  This, in turn, aids in convincing readers that might have originally disgareed with the author due to the fact that Venus' \"conditions are fare more extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth; such an environment would crush even a submarine assustomed to diving to the deepest parts of our oceans and would liquefy many metals,\" (3). The author, after making this counterclaim, refutes it by talking of some solutions to this ever-looming issue: \"NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions of the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray. Imagine a blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the roiling Venusian landscape,\" (5). The author talks of how the air pressure, temperature and radiation would all be survivable for humans. Some, such as the air pressure 30 miles above Venus, would be almost identical to Earth at sea level.  The author explains points in Venus' history that have intrigued astronomers, \"Long ago, Venus was probably covered largelyt with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, \" (4). Besides having been closer to Earth's \"twin\" many years ago, Venus may be more similar than humans thought, shown through \"The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters,\" (4). Studying Venus could lead to us knowing why this planet is such a far cry from Earth now, and this could provide valuable with how humans interact with their environment. If Venus has such similar features to Earth, like valleys, then there is probably more to discover on Venus' surface. This peculiar connection between this planet and Venus shows how valuable exploration could prove, just as Venus' proximity further supports how worthy of a pursuit Venus is.  Although Venus is analogous to Earth, there are slight differences of the two planets. Earth has average low and high temperatures, while the temperatures of Venus are more extreme. Paragraph 5 reads, \"At thirty-plus miles above the surface, temperatures would still be toasty at around 170 degrees Fahrenheit, but the air pressure would be close to that of sea level on Earth. Solar power would be plentiful, and radiaton would not exceed Earth levels. Not easy conditions, but survivable for humans\" (The Challenge of Exploring Venus).  The Earth comes right after Venus in the solar system, making it fairly close given the long time frame of space travel. Astronomers have discovered that it was also previoulsly one of the \"most Earth-like [planets]\" as it \"was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life\" (Paragraph 4). Venus also \"has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters\" (Paragraph 4). In the event that Venus became a viable option for humans to inhabit when Earth collapses (as mentioned earlier), humans would have already been exposed to some of the landscape there. Although this would make Venus more assimilable, its similarity to Earth does not outweigh the dangers that still come with the planet being an unknown land changing from its previous state. With this evidence the author provides an advantage to exploring Venus, but it does not hold up against the established points about Venus' overall uninhabitability.  In paragraph three the text illustrates,\"On the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet.\" This piece of text from paragraph three shows that we should continue studying Venus because it will allow us to learn more about the plant's harsh conditions and we would be able to see what materials could or couldn't work in such extreme heat.  The author is for the exploration of Venus, but consistently chooses to bring up the problems that doing so faces. The author writes about the difficulties about exploring Venus, because of the planet's extreme environment. They opposed their own side in paragraph three by saying, \"These conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth; such an environment would crush even a submarine accustomed to diving to the deepest parts of our oceans and would liquefy many metals.\" This is an affective strategy, because people who may oppose exploration to Venus may say something similar to this. The author is arguing their own point to establish reliability and trust amongst with people who favor not exploring Venus. The author showing that they see the problems with exploring Venus shows that they are open minded and open to their mind being changed, and this will in turn have the reader do the same.  These are all questions that need to be considered when brainstoming the idea of visitng another planet. The author of this article is avoiding all of these mainstream problems by simply saying it's worth the risks, when it actaully is not. In paragraph 3, the author explains all of the dangers of Venus and how they can affect humans. He explains, \" On the planet's surface, the temperature averages over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet.\" Considering that this is true, we can definitrly assume that condition on Venus are severly dangerous, and a lot of people may get hurt trying to explore it. The aurthor also states, \" These conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth; such an environment would crush even a submarine accustomed to diving to the deepest parts of our oeans and would liquefy many metals. What the author is stating here is that not even our strongest materials and creations can withstand the conditions on Venus. This means that in order to explore Venus we have to design all new machinery, which would cost a lot of money, not to mention the human costs as we would need humans to test things out. He also makes it notable that venus has the hottest surface of any planet, despite not being the closest to the sun. All of these facts are serious concerns when regarding human safety as well as propr functioning of machines. Even if exploring Venus was a possibilty, would it be even be worth it after all of he human costs and money costs or paid. What we are discussing here is putting human lives at risk, and spending a ton of money on a project that is no where near being ready ready to present. These reasons as well as the provided facts assure me on my claim that the author did a terrible job of supporting this idea of exploration. ",

Biased individuals are more likely to lie or include misleading statements in their advice. By discovering false or misleading statements, you can also discover hidden bias in the individual. None of us are always right, so people have mistaken opinions about many topics. When looking for help, you always run the risk of including false information from a well meaning individual, as you have nobody to fact check them against. You have no way to tell if what they're saying is true, and, if they deliver it more confidently, you may already be convinced it's a fact. Luckily, when you ask multiple people, and fact check all of their statements against one another, you can assure yourself a significantly smaller chance of obtaining false information. Although fact checking against other people can certainly help, there are other ways, including searching on Google or looking it up with a textbook, to fact check correctly. However, some statements are simply opinions and cannot be fact checked, only compared to other people's opinions.  However, even though there is much evidence to backup why going to a classroom to learn is better, it can be stated that learning online through video calls is the way to go. If students have anxiety or are constantly stressed out, learning online may be a much more relaxing way to gain material.  The evidence is all layed out, mishaps and near-mishaps, an impending catastrophe all too possible for comfort, unfair to potential voters.

So, it would be best if he looked over his essay and ,with his thesis in mind, start over from scratch.  Combining the evidence presented by the author would point to the conclusion that astronomers would need to be using vehicles and photography equipment that currently don't exist and, even with unavailable technology, they must be willing to die to travel to Venus for study.  This creates the idea in the reader's head that studying Venus is impossible, which greatly weakens the author's claim.  All in all, impossibilities, conflicting ideas, and a lack of explanation of evidence crontribute to a weak argument in favor of the idea that studing Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents.  Bias can be hard to detect in many cases, especially when the thing biased to is smaller and less prevalent. Research done by the California Critical Thinking and Development Organization, 72% of people were unable to identify bias in articles. For what seems like such a simple skill, it is surprising in the amount of people who are unable to preform it. Taking to multiple sources makes bias easier to identify, because more conflict will occur in the information. One source may leave out information to angle the evidence, while the other states all the evidence. Even in cases where bias in unavoidable, taking to multiple sources may provide better results.

The adults could realize their kids are struggling with something or not. Then, they could find the ways to share, or help. In order to not let anything bad could occur, as having negative thinkings and lead to suicide.  Computers don't have emotions, but you do! Imagine technology that seriously works for you, not only at home but also in the classroom! If technology could accurately read human facial expressions the learning possibilities could be endless. For example, think about that one story that you're forced to read that you just can't understand and brings out all your frustrations, with facial expression recognition you probably will never be so frustated again.  The implications of technology that can detect emotions simply by reading the muscles in the face sound truly remarkable. The thought that one can tell what another is thinking simply by plugging data or maybe even a picture into an algorithm sounds like fiction, but may soon be a reality. The article, \"Making Mona Lisa Smile\" by Nick D'Alto briefly discusses the possible use of such technology in a classroom. The system could examine student's faces, and if they read to be unengaged or uninterested, could adjust the lesson to make learning more interesting to that group of students. That type of technology could revolutionize learning, and customly tailor lesson plans to the feelings of students on any given day.  The technology to read emotions would greatly change the way students learn. If a teacher used this technology and noticed that all of his students were bored and uninterested, he could alter the lesson plan to make it more fun  New software has been created to determine the facial expressions of students. It uses technology to give data as to what emotions someone is feeling such as happiness, sadness, and boredom. These technologies are possibly going to be used in classrooms to help students learn better based on their emotions towards the lesson that they are learning.  They may lie about not doing their homework or be untruthful about whether they were involved in a fight. The FACS machine could solve that issue as it is able to determine whether someone is lying or not based on their expression which is stated in the quote,\" To an expert, faces don't lie; these muscle clues are sometimes used to spot when a \"smiling\" politician or celebrity isn't being truthful.\" This machine is able to examine the details of one's face to find out if they are lying or not. It examines the key traits of each specific emotion and if they are not meant, that is how it knows whther the truth has been told or not. Students will no longer bee able to weasel their way out of punishment due to their superior lying skills as the FACS machine is able to see through the lies. This is not the only thing this machine can do though for schools.  In a normal classroom, teachers create lessons that confuse the students or do not appeal to their learning ability which creates a tension for the learning environment. With the use of this technology, classroom lessons would be more educational and responsive. This is because, the technology is able to recognize when a student is confused or bored by reading their emotional and facial expressions. This is useful since the system can alter a lesson plan to be suitable for the students in the classroom which would potentially help them learn better. For example, if a student is confused during class, it is likely that they will not ask for help, leading them to not understand what is going on in the lesson. Having this technology in the classroom, would sense this and modify the lesson so that a student would be able to learn better and understand the topics. ",

                "content": "You've probably seen someone text and drive. In the few seconds they take to glance away from the road and at their phones, a car crash could happen. It only takes one second for your car to swerve into the other lane. Phones should never be used while driving for many reasons, and the main reason being that it is extremely dangerous. Texting and driving makes you 23% more likely to get in an accident. It's so much smarter to wait until you've reached your destination to use your phone. If you can't wait, you can pull over on the side of the road. If not, you could greatly risk your life.  There are plenty of other distractions that go on when driving a motorized vehicle, but the use of phones is most caused. These deaths and accidents from distracted driving with your phones can be very managed. If people were to follow the law of not using them in the car and to be more careful then these outrages percentages will become more and more less. Also, I would like to express the fact that there are many options in vehicles that allow you to use your devices via Bluetooth and voice control. So, if there was an emergency you can answer and talk on the phone without even having to pick up your phone and looking away. This concludes my essay I strongly believe in not using your devices while driving and I hope to have expressed the effect is has.  Devices cause distractions that can put not only the driver of the vehicle at risk but also those inside the vehicles, and the people all around the car. Distracted driving is one of the most dangerous types of driving and according to Edger Snyder & Associates, \"the use of cell phones while driving leads to 1.6 million crashes every year\" (Edgar Snyder & Associates \"Texting and Driving Accident Statistics - Distracted Driving\"). The sheer amount of crashes involving the use of mobile devices is shocking, and this is one of the main reasons that the use of any kind of device should be not allowed while behind the wheel of a vehicle.  Even the act of just dialing a cell phone can be dangerous. This increases the crash risk by 3 times. This is one of the worst distractions drivers can have, Due to the fact that you are not paying attention to the road. The driver's hands are not on the steering wheel which causes you to lose control of your car. This increases the accident risk highly. This is only one reason why cell phone use while driving should be illegal.  Should people use their phones while driving? Well 1 out of every 4 car accidents in the United States is caused by texting and driving. People are so distracted by their phones they forget about their own safety at risk while driving. While you're driving you should be more focused on the road and your surrounds more than a Facebook notification. It's not only teens that do this adults as well use their phones while driving. It is one of the leading reasons of car accidents today. Not only are you putting yourself at risk but you're putting others in risk as well.  You need to keep both hands on the steering wheel to be the most effective driver. But, every time you text, read messages or talk on a cell phone without a hands-free device, not only is your focus compromised, but you can't keep both hands on the wheel. Phone use when you are driving can also affect your alertness of the surroundings, which can make you prone to collisions. Also, distraction and inattention are the number one cause of traffic accidents and it is estimated that nearly every collision involves one of these two related errors. Driving takes all your attention and it is your responsibility to keep your eyes on the road, so put down the phones and pay attention to the road.  In mosts states it is illegal to even have your cell phone in your hand let alone be using it or talking on the phone while driving. If the law is not enough to persuade people to stop using phones while driving, the dangers of killing people should. Close to five thousand people died due to cell phone related crashes in 2018 (Texting and Driving Statistics 2019, thezebra. com). Even if someone is not on the phone themselves, someone else on the road could be  The use of a mobile device should not be allowed while driving a vehicle. Some states are moving to make it illegal. The accidents cause high financial damage which supports the reasoning of the states to make it illegal. The many deaths, physical injuries and emotional strain that if inficts far outweighs any possible need for using a phone. The final reason that states are making it illegal to drive distracted is because of the high amount of crashes that it causes. It is because of all these factors that the use of mobile devices while behind the wheel of any vehicle should be completely and utterly prohibited.  A simple message or text could wait. If people paid as much attention to the roads than their phones there would be less wrecks or car tragedies. Cell phones are huge distractions on drivers. Drivers are put in harm once they pick up their phones to check a text, post on social media, change songs, make videos, and etc. Cell phones while driving is like taking a risk. People are put in life or death situations once being distracted by their phones when operating a vehicle. In conclusion the use of cell phones should be prohibited while driving.     When paying attention to your cell phone it takes away the attention you need to focus on the road and drive safely. In a text on www.wikepedia.com it says \" Using a cell phone while driving increases the driver's risk of causing a crash. Drivers are distracted, decreasing the driver's awareness on the road, leading to more car crashes.\" This simply means that the use of the cell phone while driving can result in a dangerous outcome. It is also said that \"4.6 secondspass when a driver's eyes leave the road to text at 55mph, it's like driving the length of a football field blind.\" When a driver's eye is taken off the road the chance of wrecking another car or even running off the side of the road and harming yourself. The dangerous outcomes could be losing control of the wheel, crashing, running off the side of the road, harming others of all ages, running into objects ( poles, signs,cines,etc.), and the worst of all, death. Cell phone disturbance can be very dangerous when driving which is another cell phone should not be used while driving. ",

From paragraph 6 the author stated, \"A classroom computer could recongnize when a student is becoming confused or bored.\" Ending the conversation with, \"Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instuctor.\" Another point which dosn't relate to the fact of changing around lessons for a student would be also in paragraph 6,\"...if you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be different.\" This technology can overall make a students lesson, web browsing, and understanding of materal a lot easier and it could greatly improve their work.  The information gathered from students could be used for selfish purposes, as explained in the sixth passage of the article, \"if you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be different,\" showing that companies have use for this technology to better their businesses. If ad companies managed to get this emotional information from students all across the country, either from the government itself or through illegal actions, they could use that information to make new products and ads that would try to exploit the emotions of children. Because of this and the added concern of giving the information to the government itself, many parents would oppose a system that tracks and records the emotions of children.  In the passage \" Making Mona Lisa Smile\" the author states in paragraph 6 line 6,\"A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,\"Dr Huang predicts.\"then it could modify the lesson like an effective human instructor.\",this kind of technology can possibly boost testing score and even help children falling behind instead of holding them back another year. The text also states in paragraph 6 line 10 that ;\"Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communcation,\"notes Dr. Huang.\". This example actually explains alot of real world issues in the classroom, such as the fact that some students refuse to even try to communicate their confusion or boredom in the classroom so then they often disengage in the lesson and miss every part that would be essential to reaching standards created by the state.  Electronics as of now are programmed to teach a student however are unable to sense how the student is feeling or how they are actually doing on their assignment. As the author states in the article, \"most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication\" something which computers are unable to detect (para. 6). Not only this, but the author gives an analogy that states \"if you smile when a web ad appears on your screen, a smilar ad might follow\" and explains that in a classroom, similar techniques can be applied to benefit the student (para. 6). Using this program will allow technology to advance and in turn will benefit the student.  This technology could also help both students and teachers in a long-term manner. In paragraph 7 of the article, it is revealed that this new technology could \"even indicate the difference between a genuine smile and a forced one\" (Paragraph 7). Say there is a classroom without an emotion-sensing computer. In the classroom there is a student who, behind the fake smile is dealing with something that they cannot tackle on their own. The teacher never notices, and the child goes on without help. Now imagine if there was a computer in that class  like its says in paragraph 6 \"Imagine a computer that knows when you're happy or sad\". For example if you smile when a web ad appears on your screen a similar ad might follow. But if you frown the next ad will be different \"A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored \"Most human communication is nonverbal including emotional communication\" noted Dr. Huang \"So computers need to understand that too  If implemented in daily computers, this technology will revolutionize the environemnt and usage of the Internet. Because this technology can map emotions, \"if you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be different\" (6). With the implementation of this technology, students will be able to influence which advertisements and pages appear on their screen. This will reduce their impatience on the computer, and actually stay focused on the task at hand, rather than getting frustrated and walking away.  In the sixth paragraph of the article \"Making Mona Lisa Smile,\" the author illuminates the possibilites of success human-emotion-recognizing computer software provides in terms the world of marketing, describing how analyzing the emotional response to a Web ad popping up on one's computer screen can mold the variety of its future ads to a more preferred selection (6).  As mentioned in paragraph 6 in the article, FACS can be used to recognize when a student is confused. Schools could take advantage of this technology to notify teachers when a student is struggling with material, and help them get back on track. This would allow teachers to adapt their teaching style to best suit each student.  As described in paragraph 6, a students facial expression has the power to change a lesson. If this is true, could a student not simply fake an emotion to get out of assignments or slack off by acting confused. The article claims that the software can pick up on fake smiles, but can it detect false expressions for other emotions as well? Another flaw within this system is the emotions the technology is capable of percieving, paragraph 6 disscusses the modification of a lesson based on boredom or confusion detected by the computer, however, neither of these two feelings are listed in the 6 emotions that the software is capable of detecting (paragraph 3). These two major flaws within the software lead to only one conclusion, the technology is simply not advanced enough to take on the role of a teacher. ",

                "content": "The Electoral College is a method of voting for President and Vice President that was produced by our founding fathers in the articles of the Constitution. The Electoral College has been in use for centuries, but it is time that we disregard it.  Source 2 states that if a tie happens, the election would be thrown to the House of Representatives, where state delegations vote on the president. The senate would choose the vice-president. The state delegations may not vote for the president you want and the senate may not vote for the vice-president you want either.  The Electoral College has served us for more than a century in determining our nation's new president. \"The Electoral College process consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for President and Vice President, and the counting of the electoral votes by Congress,\" states the article \"What Is the Electoral College?\" written by the Office of the Federal Register. This means that we do not vote directly vote for our new president, but instead vote for electors that vote for a candidate running for office. Though many individuals are in favor of keeping the Electoral College, if kept, it will continue to cause problems in our nation.  in the case of nationally voting to decide our vital political figures, such as the President and Vice-President, the ballot of the Electoral College is not giving the voters of America a fair result when it comes to the final moments of a presidental election.  If two candidates receive the same number of electoral votes and tie in an election, the House of Representatives then chooses the president, while the Senate choose the vice president, but their votes may not show who voters want as president, seeing that voters often vote one party for president while the other for their representatives (Plumer 12). The vote for president is distributed unevenly, and states with many voters will only be represented by one vote. this could lead to the House of Representatives choosing a president that is only liked by a small population and this cannot easily be undone. Swing states are the only thing that can cause or prevent a tie in elections, and a tie has almost occured in 1976 in Hawaii and in 1968 in Ohio.  Secondly, Plumer claims \"Perhaps most worrying is the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote. In that case, the election would be thrown to the House of Representatives, where state delegations vote on the president. (The senate would choose the vice-president.) Because each state casts only one vote, the single representative from Wyoming, representing 500,000 voters, would have as much say as the 55 representatives from California, who represnt 35million voters.\" This method is rediculous.  In order to understand the flaws in the electoral college, you need to know what the electoral college is, and how it came to be. \"The Electoral College process consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for President and Vice President, and the counting of the electoral votes by Congress.\" (Office of the Federal Register 2). This system was created by the founding fathers as a compromise between the congressional vote and the popular vote. However there was a reason for this new, seperated voting system. During their time the founding fathers where among the most educated men in the country. Back then education was not standard and very few people could read or write. The founding fathers did not want uneducated citizens voting on the individual who would lead the country. So they created a system where the uneducated would vote for a group of educated men, who would in turn vote on a president. Thus the electoral college was born.  It's the Tuesday after the first Monday in November, can you guess what it is? It's election day! Every four years, nearly every person in America will vote to choose a new President, or do we? Yes, we live in a democracy where we can vote for who runs out country, but do we really make the descision? The Electoral College is a phase where electors, of a candidate running for president, come together and decide for who is the President, Vice President, and include the countings of the electoral votes from Congress. The person who runs for President has a select group of people known as electors, which are typically chosen by that person's political party  The Electoral College was established in the Constitution by the founding fathers. \"The Electoral College process consists of the selection of electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for president and Vice President, and the counting of the electoral votes by Congress\" is stated in source 1. This is process has been around for decades, but things have changed.  electors choose the president and the vice president and the counting of the electoral votes by congress. ",

Since each state has only one vote to cast, a vote from a state containing 500,000 people would carry the same weight as a vote representing the opinions of 35 million. Given that many voters vote one party for president and another for Congress, the selection made by the House of Represenatives can hardly be expected to respesent the will of the people.     When people go out of thier way to vote, they vote because they want to have a say in their potentially future. They vote for who they believe would lead our society and modern day world in the right direction. They would like to think that one vote could make a difference in a election, but with the Electoral College voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference rather than vote who they actulally want to be president.  This is due to winning by just enough in certain states that you get their elector votes.\u00a0 If you win by 51% in a state with 4 electoral votes, but someone else wins by 99% in a state with 3 electoral votes, you will have more electoral votes, but less popular votes.\u00a0 In the system that we are set up with, electoral votes is how you will get elected for President.\u00a0 This happened during the Presidental Election in 2000, when Gore won the popular vote, but Busch won the electoral votes and was elected President.\u00a0 It also happened several times before, most recently in 1888.   The winner-takes-all method is as literal as it sounds; the winner takes all. For example if someone was running for president and they got 301 votes and 370 electoral college votes, they would win (you only need a majority of 270 votes to be elected.  When electing the president of the United States, you must vote in favor of the president you want. However, instead of coming down to popular vote, the system uses the Electrolar College to decide. The Electroral Vote works in that the people of a certain states votes for their candidate and the majority of people who vote for a certain president give their votes to a slate of voters. What this means is that the popular vote within a state wins the electoral votes of the electors who then vote for the president.  When chossing a president remember that your one vote will not have a great effect on who is president but the electoral college does. Having both popular vote and electoral college vote will allow all citizen to be involed in the slection of your presient. Getting rid of it my allow more of the non congress citizen to have more of a say. The congress is part of our country to and they should be able to vote the way they want to.    Using the popular vote as the one and only way of electing presidents is needed in this country. The choice of presidents should be soley up to the american people. There should be no electoral college that can totally change the outcome of a election because one candidate doesent have enough electoral votes.  Each state gets one vote and then the electors can choose who they want for president. In source two it states that the electoral college consists of 538 electors and the most amont of elecrtoral votes is 270, in order to pick an president. Also in source two it states that the number of electors we have equals to the amount of members of congress we have. I propose a new system by only letting the American people select our president by votes counted all up by each state, for example if we didn't have have electoral college,\u00a0 then it would be a fair vote because people votes would count the number that adds up with all votes for one candidates that will oppose another candidates and there would be technically no tie it would either ,more or less, but if we still had the electoral college then the vote would not be equally fair becuse if the majority of a state for examlpe\u00a0 chose republican candidate, then that would be vague becuse some people choose democratic and there vote did not really count. but without the electoral collge, than everyones vote counts and each candidates gets vote from every one, not only electoral.  Under the Electoral College, it is entirely possible for a Presidential Candidate to win presidency, even with the majority of voters voting for the oposing candidate. We should discard the Electoral College in favor of the popular vote.   If two candidates receive the same number of electoral votes and tie in an election, the House of Representatives then chooses the president, while the Senate choose the vice president, but their votes may not show who voters want as president, seeing that voters often vote one party for president while the other for their representatives (Plumer 12).

Also in source two it states that the number of electors we have equals to the amount of members of congress we have. I propose a new system by only letting the American people select our president by votes counted all up by each state, for example if we didn't have have electoral college,\u00a0 then it would be a fair vote because people votes would count the number that adds up with all votes for one candidates that will oppose another candidates and there would be technically no tie it would either ,more or less, but if we still had the electoral college then the vote would not be equally fair becuse if the majority of a state for examlpe\u00a0 chose republican candidate, then that would be vague becuse some people choose democratic and there vote did not really count. but without the electoral collge, than everyones vote counts and each candidates gets vote from every one, not only electoral.   The Electoral College is a system that allots a certain amount of electoral votes to each state. Each state is given 2 electoral votes plus another amount of votes which depends on that state's population. The amount of votes ranges from 3 to 55 (source 3). A candidate must recieve 270 out of 538 possible votes. The candidate the electoral votes of a state go to is decided by the majority vote of each individual state. In all states but Maine and Nebraska give a candidate the entirety of their votes if the majority of its citizen votes for them (source 1)  When the Constitution of the United States was written our founding fathers decided on an Electoral College as the way to ellect the president instead of a direct vote. The Electoral College is a process that makes a compromise between the popular vote of the citizens and the Congressional vote. When citizens vote for president they are actually voting for a member of the Electoral College that is going to select their president, rather than the citizens voting for the president themselves. The Electoral College is made of 538 electors, the number of electors from each state varies depending on the states Congressional delegation. Washington D.C. is counted as a state for this process and alloted only three electors.  Most states in the electoral college is based on a \"winner take all\" system; if the candidate gets the majority of votes in that state, that candidate gets the electors (Source 1). This means most candidates focus in on the states they know that they have a chance of winning, and focus on going after \"swing states\" (Source 2).\u00a0 If a candidate was to get the majority in Texas, Florida, and California, the three biggest swing states, the candidate would have 122 electoral votes, almost half of the 270 votes necessary to win (Sources 1 and 3).  Most people dont really understand what the Electoral College is, or what it is about, so let me just inform you about it a little. The Electoral College is a process that was established in the constitution and it is a strategy that we use to elect out presidents. The citizens vote for the president, but so the the electors in the Electoral College. There are over five hundred members of the Electoral College, and if a canadate wants to win presidency, he/she has to gain 270 of the Electoral College's votes. Each person running has a set of their own electors  As said in the article, \"What Is The Electoral College?\", \"The Electoral College process consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for President and Vice President, and the counting of the electoral votes by Congress.\" That is a huge amount of work but that is what keeps the elections well organized. Each candidate running for President in a state has their own group of electors. After each election, the governor of your state prepares a certificate presenting all of the candidates that ran for your state. As stated in the article by the Office of the Federal Register, \"The Certificate of Ascertainment also declares the winning presidential candidate in your state and shows which electors will represent your state at the meeting of the electors in December of the election year.\" The Electoral College is what mantains everything professional.

They have more say and there votes feel more important. This will encourage potential voters to vote and to become more involved with the political events.  and gets them involved in what is happening around them.   Typically, in a learning context, more passion or excitement transfers to more success at whatever it is the students are trying to learn. Being more passionate about something causes people to interact with it much more, and interaction is key to the learning of many students. In addition, students being excited to do something furthers the self-motivation mentioned above. If there is something that a student wants to do, they will do it without needing a teacher to tell them to. Overall, the passion that comes from student-designed summer work makes it a much more fun and more effective experience for students.  To improve student input schools should move towards student designed projects so students will be more intrested and and involved in the project.  it will make the children performing the tasks more responsible.  It would help them become more independent and self reliant. The students already have to do what the teacher says during the school year, so this would make for a great chance for them to do what they need to on their own time. It would also teach them to be responsible for themselves\u00a0and for their own work. For example, if the student understands that they are no longer in a classroom setting where the teacher explains everything to them, they will conclude they must rely on themselves to complete the task at hand. Which would lead to more independence rather than depending on the teacher.  personalize the project to their liking which would make them more eager to complete it,  Requiring participation in extracurricular activities ultimately does more harm than good to students because it disregards that broad range of activities students enjoy and takes valuable time from students who should be free to choose how to spend it. It also detracts from the value of extracurricular activities- which are created by people cooperating and acting on a common interest -by adding people who don't enjoy the activity. Inspiring students to be curious and passionate should be the school's priority, but by requiring students to do an extracurricular club the schools are only boxing students into a mold that ignores the complexity and individuality of each person. Students are required to get an education that will help them survive as adults, but they should be able to decide which hobbies and skills they want to specialize in. In the end, the unique path they decide to carve out for themselves should be of their own making.  parents would be less involved,  This is mostly due to the fact that students can choose the things that better relate to their interests. They become interested in both the project and the relevant part of the curriculum. Applying the information you learned in previous school year is an excellent way to test what you've learned - and applying it to something you genuinely care about is the best test of your understanding. Also, people must be interested in a project before they can be enthusiastic (or willing at the least) to engage with the it, and everyone knows that engagement is a good thing for learning. Students incorporating something into their break makes them even more likely to do it, a fact that has had especially important bearing for me this last year, where it's been challenging to stay on top of the workload. The few times I've taken some days off to relax, I noticed that it was comparatively really difficult to get myself to do stuff when starting again. I feel even more apprehensive if I get out of the habit entirely. It's simple: when you give a student a break, they're more likely to engage in school projects if they feels like a part of their break, so not only does letting students design their own projects provide quality, but quantity. Here's an example which fits perfectly with what I'm saying: I walked into my History of the Americas class at the beginning of the year, and many of my peers who were top students had not finished reading the books they were assigned during the summer and fudged the details on the accompanying paper. When listening to them, the most common remarks were about how dry and uninteresting the prescribed book list was and how having to do it in the summer was an annoyance that they just wanted to put off. Meanwhile, most student-designed projects I know of provide much better learning and motivation. The biggest example I've in my mind when writing this is my experience with the I'm in the IB program, where students are required to complete an  Extended Essay, a 16 - 20 page paper on a subject of your choice. Because I can do mine on the physics and mathematics of a diabolo (similar to a yo-yo), and I spend a lot of my free time invested in this object anyway, I've never looked forwards to a project so much in my life (not to mention I love math and problem solving)! I started last summer by doing some experiments, and have since been leaning towards the math side to discover new math (like the calculus in a Lagrangian) and push myself, actually using what I've learned in school.

With FACS a student could come into class like Charlie and no one knows about his frustrations so they try to do their normal jokes and games with him. If a student ever comes into class not feeling the best or not wanting to be bothered, FACS could sense that and instead of people messing with that kid or having that kid be bothered, that child could have the option of being away from everyone while the child cools down. That could stop the child from being involved in a physical altercation or any altercations at that.  In an argument people tend to be very blindsided and naive, because they always think they are in the right. However there are always two sides to every story, and other people can help you see both. Many times you don't understand what someone else might be going through and it is always good for someone to humble you every now and then to make you understand others. Whenever something is going wrong, it's necessary to understand it ask someone else what they think by viewing all sides or the problem.  Some students may panic because they won't understand the new material or that they will fall behind in the class because they don't remember how solve a simple question, but if teachers design a project based on their class, it gives students an idea of what to expect. For example, a student will be taking Algebra 2 in the upcoming school year, but doesn't know anything about the class. A simple teacher-designed project that could help a student is a packet with math problems from every unit with examples that explains how to do it, so when students go back to school, they aren't completely blindsided by the new concept. Most schools, mainly high school and middle school, have reading assignments that students must complete before the school year. Reading projects could range from reading a certain book and writing an essay about it to completing a reading bingo where students have to complete a series of reading tasks of their choosing. Yes, the word project seem bland and a complete waste of time while students are on their break, but it doesn't have to be boring as long as it serves the purpose of helping students learn.  The saying that other people show the best in you can be used when talking about giving advice, because people can show you new ways to see something or tell you something that you didnt know. Friends can show you the situation you are in from all different angles and not just the one you are stuck in. They can also tell you what they would do in your shoes, or how they would handle your position. Past experiences can change a persons perspective of their life so they don't make the same mistake twice, but they can also help others to not make the mistake at all. In conclusion, there are many ways others can help you for advice like sharing their past, saying what they would do, and showing you all perspectives. Everything talked about in this essay can help you come to your conclusion on what is best for you.  To summarize, because students get to socialize with people they never got the opportunity to talk to before, experience new things and get taught new skills, and impact the community as well as themselves, I believe extracurricular activities should definitely be included at our school. They are a very bright part of anyone's day, something that a kid could look forward to on a boring Monday. Also, they could find out new things they didn't have a clue about. A teen gets to talk to others near their age group who started out just being part of a crowd, but because they met them while playing the part of Juliet, they turned into a best friend. Additionally, we get to help the whole state while having a incredible time. So whether it's the applause of an audience at a play, the encouraging comment of a friend on a picture, or the announcement of a score it took a team effort to achieve, the activity that got someone there made a mark on their heart.  Children were told sometime in their life that everybody was unique and\u00a0different\u00a0in some sort of way, that there were absolutely no two people that looks the same, much less\u00a0think and act the same. This applies in everyday life from then and getting advice is not the exception. Everybody has different beliefs, experience and ways to do things so it's hard to find one person that exactly understand you to the point of giving you advice perfectly.  This is good for the person who is asking advice, because the person can look at the problem in all different ways, and see which solution best fits their personal needs and goals. This is better because what makes sense to one person, might not make sense to another person. As they say, nobody knows someone better than them self, which applies to someones problems. Hearing different points of views will also allow someone to see which point of view is the most popular opinion, and they can make their decision based off of what most people agree on.  Considering others thoughts on a situation is important because it can show you how others handle a situation. Plus, you might change the way you think about things. For example, if you have a friend that is constantly being mean to you, your first thought may be to argue and fight with her. But, if you go to another few people, I'm sure they will most likely tell you that violence isn't the best option, and that you should stay calm and work things out verbally. When you think about and understand others points of view, it can hep you gain knowledge, plus if the advice dosen't\u00a0work you will know not to use again. Everyone learns from their mistakes, just as well as they can learn from bad or non realistic advice. Even just a few people can change they way you would have handled a problem.  If a student wrote a summer assignment paper about what they thoroughly know, it does not teach them anything new. They are not receiving\u00a0any new information, but on the contrary, if they were exposed to a new topic and researched about it, they would be able to retain new information and learn more. It could lead the students to more success to; if they are opened to new ideas and points of views, the student will learn more and be able to grow in knowledge rather than be stuck in the same perspective that they are in. For example, if a student was bias against the creation of country clubs and corporate made communities, but was to read about why those were created due to an assignment, he or she may have a shift in perspective and mind. This does not apply that he or she has changed their mind, but it has opened up their knowledge and gave them a fuller picture rather than it magnified.  Regardless, if students like the subject of research, or not, that practice will help them grow in writing, reading, and critical thinking skills as well. This increase in knowledge applies to when the teacher is designing the assignments.  However, they are incorrect because everyone is unique, has their own way of understanding certain situations, and solves problems in different ways. ",

Dr. Huang predicted that the system would be able to manipulate lessons based on the readings of emotional expressions in the classroom. The use of this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable, because it would benefit the student's learning ability in the classroom.  The Facial Action Coding system could be very valuable in classrooms. It has many benefits to both students and educators. It would allow students to remain engaged, learn better, and it would also help educators, A system like this could really allow all students to reach their full potential.  Using the Facial Action Coding System to read the emtional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable because it allows students to learn better.  Based on the evidence given in the article, the use of Facial Action Coding Stystems in the classroom would be wildly valuable. The computer can detect many levels of emotion to accomodate their program to the students' needs. If a particular lesson bores a student or that student has lack of focus, the computer can adjust and change many aspects of thier layout to catch the student's attention. Also, students can receive the correct level of work- whether that be too easy or too hard. And not only can students benefit, but teachers, as well. They can track student progress to further accomodate their needs. While technology can be used for many unethical things, the Facial Action Coding System would be extremely effective in a school setting.      Educators have a very important job. They are building the future for society, which can be very hard. Teachers have to deal with many students, and every student is different. With the use of the Facial Action Coding System, teachers don't have to worry about a teaching method that will not work with all students. In the article \"Making Mona Lisa Smile\" by Nick D'Alto it says that the system recognizes if a student is confused, and alters the lesson to better fit the student. This allows educators to not worry about finding a teaching method that suites every student. This technology also helps out educators, because it works one on one with students. It's made to help every student individually by reading the student's facial expressions. As student's learning patterns may change, the system changes with the student. The use of this technology will also be helpful for teachers because educators can take a look and see what teaching methods work the best with students overall. In the article it says the system can detect when students are confused and bored, so educators can use this technology to see what doesn't make students feel confused nor bored. This technology could be very valuable and helpful for educators.  The highly inteliigent Facial Action Coding System a valuable asset for students in a classroom, as it fosters an enjoyable and captivating learning environment that will shape the students' commitment to school. This advanced software analyzes the movement of a human's facial muscles, comparing it to an emotionless one, and determines the percent distribution their feelings. This innovative software provides students with the ability to customize the pages and lessons on the computer, giving them control over their method of learning. Students with this ability will feel captivated by their learning, as they are in control and can decide how they learn. The development of a desire to learn is crucial for school-aged children so that in the future, they will continue on to further educate themselves and expand their knowledge. This facial  -analysis technology provides schools with the ability to create a captivating learning environment for students that will motivate them to stay committed to their education and reach their goals. While this new technology provides a bounty of benefits to many, assisting students in the achievement of their hopes and dreams holds the most value.  The quality of learning in a classroom setting could be improved by teachers knowing the emotions of their students, which would make new technology such as the Facial Action Coding System, valuable in a classroom setting. This technololgy would be beneficial because it could identify whether students are confused or bored, which would make class time more productive and interesting, as well as make sure all students understood the material. This would improve their quality of learning, and make school more meaningful.

                "content": "As stated before, the larger the population of a states, the more Electoral College votes that state gets. This leads to a small group of \"big states\" that have such a large amount of votes, they are the target for candidates to try to persuade to vote for them. On the opposite side of the spectrum, most of the other 50 states have a smaller amount of votes and are less of an objective for candidates to acquire.  It also means that larger states have the advantage, because they get more votes, like California (55), Texas (38), and Florida (29), while smaller states get less, such as Alaska (3), Rhode Island (3), and Hawaii (4). Just to add insult to injury, this means that larger states are more fought over by politicians, leaving smaller states practically ignored. This is unfair to people in the Dakotas or Montana have no information to base their votes on, instead just picking a canidate by mainly party affiliation. the biggest political battles are in fact fought over the biggest states, in the forms of advertisements and propaganda. Although the propaganda is truely just that: propaganda, there is some truth in them, and the voters in bigger states are more well versed in the political and practical advantages of one canidate over the other. Article 3, while defending the Electoral College, in fact condems itself, by saying that voters in so called \"swing states,\" where there is no true dominant party, are likely to be given the most information on the canidates as they battle over who will get that state's votes in the college. The same thing can be said for the bigger states, because neither politician can really afford to let the other gain the upper hand in that state. Therefore smaller states, or states that are basicly marooned on one party are ignored or disregarded as worthless and unattainable in any case, so they widthold information from them, forcing them to vote blindly in favor of whichever party they choose, which votes may be discarded anyway. With an uncensored popular vote, the political canidates will be forced to advertise for all of the united states, instead of just the bigger or indevisive states. this will also remove all of the unfair advantages from the larger states, including more information as well as an unfairly weighted voting system.  It only makes sense that the larger states with a larger population should get more of a say in their government, and recieve more electoral votes than a small state with fewer people. With this system political infulence is restored to the larger states making the canidates focuss on the more populous areas. More power to the more populous states also means that run-off elections are avoided. In 1992 and in 1968 run-off elections were avoided due to the use of the Electoral College; \"Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992 both had only a 43 percent plurality of the popular votes, while winning a majority of the Electoral College\" P.22. A run-off election extreamly complicates the election process however the chance of this happening is greatly reduced when using the Electoral College which almost always produces a clear winner.  This would be very unfair to the smaller states for an obvious reason, population. Even though a few states might have a bigger population that doesn't particularly mean that everyone in the state will vote. There are still \"independent voters\". For example, as stated in paragraph twenty-one, the election voting in Florida was very close and relied a lot on popular votes. Florida ended up getting twenty-nine electoral votes, compared to Wyoming who only got three electoral votes. State size does matter because larger states will typically always get more attention from the presidential candidates than smalller ones.  When the US Constitution was first made, the idea of equality between the states was made. This meant that the size or population of a state gave it no disinct advantage over another. They did this through the creation of the House of Representatives and the Senate, yet there was one more issue they had to solve. This issue was how they could count the votes of citizens all aroun the US fairly. They solved it with electoral college, a system in which the voters don't directly vote for the president, but vote for a group, or slate, of people who have sworn to a canidate who vote for you. This system as Source 2 states can easily be broken with a group of swing votes in some states, but because it keeps thing equal, we must see that making popular vote the process isn't a good idea, because larger states will have more power.  Every state gets a minimum of 3 electoral votes, and then more are added depeding on the size of the state's population.\u00a0 WIth 3 votes for a population of 500,000, Wyoming has more votes per citizen than the larger states do.\u00a0 Large states with ten of millions of people may have only a few more votes than Wyoming does, giving it's individual citizens more power in choosing the President.   \"It avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of vote cast.\" as stated in the article by Richard Posner. It balances the votes by a larger state compared to a smaller state. In article \"In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to kep our despised method of choosing the President\", the author states that a larger state has more popular votes rather than a small state. The author says this, \"The popular vote was very close in Florida [in 2012]; nevertheless Obama, who won that vote, got 29 electoral votes. A victory by the same margin in Wyoming would net the winner only 3 electoral votes.\" As that being said, the author is explaining how larger states get more attention from a presidential candidates in a campain than a small state does. This is when the Electoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment.  Each vote counts as one, and there will be more or less votes depending on the state and its size and population.  The number of electors per state under the Electoral College is determined by the number of representatives the state has in congress. \"... one for each member in the House of Representatives plus two for your senators...\" (Office of the Federal Register 3). Since this system is based on population, bigger states get a emense priority over smaller states. \"The popular vote was very close in Florida [in 2012]; nevertheless Obama, who won that vote , got 29 electoral votes. A victory by the same margin in Wyoming would net the winner only 3 electoral votes.\" (Posner 21). This means that presidential candidates are going to focus on appealing to larger swing states that have more electoral votes, rather than smaller ones who only provide a few votes. That is not fair now is it? No matter how small a state may be its population still consists of United States' citizens, and they deserve just as much say as a bigger state. After all, that is the concept our country was founded on, equality and freedom.  If there was a tie in the election, the election would be given to the House of Representatives. In that election, each state has only one vote. So a state with a bigger population has the same say than a state with a smaller population. According to Plumer, because many voters vote one party for president and another party for Congress, the House's selection will not entirely reflect the will of the people. A tie in the electoral college is possible beacause the amount of electoral votes is 538 which is an even number (source 3). ",

                "content": "To begin, by keeping the electoral college we could avoid run off elections.\u00a0 This would help our governmental system  Electoral College has been an efiicient way that has been around for years to select reperesentatives in each state that may have a bigger chance in politics in the future. As the people of one country, we are able to get our voices heard throughtout the world. The Electoral College contains people who you are able to trust, the people who can express their political views very clearly, and that it provides political balance throughout.   To conclude the argument, Electoral College should forsure be removed. Citizens favor popular vote over an electors vote. Candidates and voters enter a whole different threshold to express their political preferance. Why should the government even have voting if there really not truly being seen in the correct way. Citizens want to take a stand and vote in what the mind believes in. Take out Electoral College, and let the voters vote, actually count.  You should keep the Electoral College because the founding fathers of the United States Of America established it when they made the constitiution.  In conclusion, the Electoral College should be kept as a part of the voting system because it gives a more concentrated form of voting, it only needs the same amount of trust betweencitizen and candidate as every other election style, and overall makes the voting system more reliable.  the United States needs to keep the Electoral College instead of the popular vote because you will always have an outcome and one region can't overpower another and make a candidate win the presidental campaign. Yes, as said before many people want to get rid of the Electoral College but it will stay with the United States and move forward with us people.  The question of whether or not to abolish or keep the Electoral College in tact is a heavily debated one, but it is clear that getting rid of the Electoral College will be highly beneficial to the voters of America. The Electoral College was established hundreds of years ago when our Constitution came about and it created a complicated process to elect the President and Vice President of the United States.  In conclusion, the Electoral college is beneficial to the people and a wise idea. The people in the entire country are never going to unanimously agree on anything. Keeping the Electoral college is not only wise, but a safe way to ensure that voting doesn't go wrong, and that the people\u00a0 always get a fair say in government matters.       \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0       \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  Additionally, the Electoral College sould be kept in today's democracy because is allocates power to the larger states  Our Electoral College system should be defended and kept. It has the ability to produce a solid outcome, has flaws but ones that are not more disasterous than other systems, and drives candidates to try and present a national appeal. A single vote does not decide an election, the representation of our people should not be split in half, divided. The Electoral College does its best to give the nation the president it deserves. ",

                "content": "The bottom line and one of the main reasons we should have our phones available for use is the connection.  Firstly, the internet and modern technology's first purpose is to make our lives better.  Back in the 1950's people had to use cars to do eveything. From talking to a friend face to face to going to the nearest resturant. But now you can do all of that in your own living room, due to technology that has advanced us to be able to use Facetime, Skype, or Oovoo to talk to our friends face to face using out phone, tablet, or personal computer. And to drive anywhere we need to we have apps the diliver taxies to our houses for us.\"...the Internet makes telecommuting possible and allows people to feel more connected without driving to meet friends...Likewise the rise in cellphones and car-pooling apps have facilitated more flexiable commuting arrangements, including the evolution of shared can services fro getting to work.\" ( Paragraph 35, Rosenthal)  Working everyday will effect this because no one wants to miss work. Missing work means less money and creates more stress for the person missing work. By saving maybe $10 on gas that day you're missing out on the $125 you could've made by working, but there's another solution to this also. Car-pool! Even if you're driving the car yourself or you're in the car you're saving fule and money.   Technology often has problems and cannot be guaranteed to work and not every student does not has access to internet connection.  hacking is commonly a misunderstood phenonenon. The aboslute requirement for all hacking is access to the device that someone wishes to hack usually through some internet connection on the device linked to other functions. This is easily remedied through the use of local software on the driverless car, cutting it off from the internet as well as making the entertainment and information systems independent of the driving system.  Technology has become almost fully integrated into today's society. Computers, smart phones, and more are used in a positive aspect; the driverless car is no exception.  Imagine the following scenario: you wake up in the morning and there is two feet of snow on the ground. You turn on the television and your local news station reports that your school is closed today, so rather than spending a wasteful snow day doing nothing and having to make up seat time later in the year, you log onto your computer and connect with your teachers and classmates via video chat. In many schools in the United States, this situation is quite common. As technology becomes readily available to more and more people, some schools offer the option for students to learn without being at school by way of the Internet. Those who oppose online school argue that technology is harmful to learning and that the best learning environment is the classroom. While it is ideal that the student be in the classroom, sometimes technology is helpful when the student cannot physically attend class  some students may feel that they can never get a break since they always have access to the internet  If it is not being hacked into, technology and the internet is also known to malfunction often, which could lead to innumerable amounts of incidents.   As modern technology progresses, more and more of our everyday activities are shifting from manual and on-paper activities to automated online functions. A key example of this in modern society is something as normal as email. In the past, people communicated via letters which had to be mailed to each other, taking weeks to deliver;  however, the modern day email technology allows us to deliver messages to others in seconds. As we progress further and further into the future, more and more of these essential daily activities transfers from manual/ in person contact, to automated and online activities. The next major milestone of this online revolution is to make digital and online education and teaching more wide scale\u00a0so that every student and school can benefit. Many schools have began to offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. ",

A family member, close friend, or anyone you trust really would be a good option for this. If they are older than you its likely they had to make some similar decision\u00a0and will relate to you and your situation and try their best to help aid you in making a good choice. These people that have more experience in life and are willing to help you really make the difference and help you make the best choice possible.  Even today many struggle in making decisions of their own; if students are taught to make choose what they want to do, they'll have less difficulty in making good choices for themselves. Sometimes adults do not know what choices to make as some do not choose wisely. Letting students make their decisions through own accord can make it easier for them when they have to make important choices in their life as their brain will be programmed to think about the choice they are making. There are many skills people need to survive in the real world and decision making is one of them. Little things can have a big impact on many; it may not seem like a lot to let students design their projects but it can be a big influence on many.  The decision maker can use all the advise they've gotten from different people to make their own choice, and feel better prepared. They will be more focused as they know what they want to do, and will feel more confident and less overwhelmed. Feeling less overwhelmed can be a big help as the person doesn't have to be so worried, so they won't have any distractions from making the best possible decision. For example, if someone is trying to decide what kind of car they want to get, and they've gotten advise from numerous people, they can make a better choice when picking. They'll know exactly what they want, as they've heard many thoughts from the people around them, and so they can make their final decision.   and we can kind of learn what we want to do when we're older.  If students don't get the opportunity to work with a group, and to work as a team, then they wouldn't be prepared for life when they are older.  Learning to work with people is one of the most important things you need to know how to do.  So the sooner that you start, the better the future that you will have.  If you don't know how to work with people, then the path that is in front of you is rough because nobody will want to hire you, nobody will want to work with you, and nobody will have sympathy for you.  Nobody will hire you because they will look at your back round\u00a0and see nothing in you that will help them in their work space.  Nobody will want to work with you because you will be mean and do little to no work.  Finally, nobody will have sympathy for you because they know that you had every chance to be successful, but you chose not to be.  Most people don't want that, do you?  Think about all the futures you could save by just putting a little discipline. A C isn't very far from an F and that could jeopardize there whole life. If they study hard, they can have fun and live a good life when they get older, but having fun and neglecting studying now isn't going to give them a relaxing and fun future.  Do you want your advice to help you make the best choice? When people ask for advice, they tend to ask more than one person because they want to make the better choice for themselves. People who want to make the best choice look for credibility, different ideas, and different views, and they do this by asking many different kinds of people from young to old, people from different countries, and more. They want as much opinions as possible so they can narrow it down to one idea that will help them make the best choice. For example, a student might be researching about the Civil War for their history paper. They might ask their history teacher for ideas because their teacher happens to be history major. The student decides to ask their parents about their views and ideas and it just so happens that they are both professors with a PhD\u00a0in history. The student gathers all the opinions they got and writes the paper and gets an A. The student knew they were going to pass because they asked people who were experts on history, and listened to their different views and ideas.  It's a rebellious stage of life when they think they can do whatever pleases them. So naturally if someone tells them that they absolutely must do something, they automatically think no way. If they have an attitude like this it will ruin the experience and they won't get the good feeling people do when you serve others. They might dislike it so much that they don't even do service when they're grown up. They resent people that tell them they have to do something, and then they are ornery towards everyone else afterwards.  The first step to make a good decision is to think about your conquences. Some people make a decision and regret it because they did not think about their conquences. For example, when people go to jail, they regret their descision they made because it changed their life in a horrible way. Other peoples opinions can lead you into a bad direction, if you dont think about the possible outcomes. There can be some bad outcomes when you listen to peoples opinions, but if you chose carefully and follow the correct steps it will not be so bad. If someone is per-persuring you, that is never the right way to listen someones advice because they are forcing you. Always listen to yourself when someone is forcing you and not always be a follower, but also listen to other opinons when they are not forcing you.  making a choice is difficult than it already is, and making the best choice does not seem like it is any more luxurious. Some people might be able to decisions\u00a0at the speed of light without getting any opinions, while others might need some more opinions in order to make their decision. Life is all about making choices everyday and people have to accept the results that come out of it. Some people might be more carefree about it, while others might need to think more before they make a choice. Wanting to make the best choice is not selfish at all and is just a part of life. Wanting the credibility, different ideas and views from people is just another way of making the best choice. Therefore, seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice because of credibility, people have different ideas, and people have different views. ",

We need to stand up and allow everyone to be able to have a say in elections. With the popular vote every citizen will have they're own say in what gets made of our beautiful country. We, the people, need to make the change from Electoral College voting to popular vote becauseit gives people a say in who runs our country, an eaier way to elect someone into office, and no one state has more of a say than another.  In conclusion changing the way people vote is easier for everybody. It saves time for electors and it gives people a chance to see who they are really voting for. Presidents would have to go to each state and appeal to them in order to get a vote. I belive that is what we need. They would be required to actually work for a position in office rather than speaking on whjat they are going to do and paying someone else to elect them. We should have faith in our president and know who we are voting for before we cast our vote. This system seems more fair and more modern to the twenty first century. This is a system most Americans would agree with.  In conclusion, the popular voting method should be applied as the designated process of electing the United States President because it guarantees a direct vote towards a desired candidate of your choice. As our country is listed as a democracy, the votes towards the President should lie in the hands of the people. The electoral college is prone to many more problems and is a more complex method of voting. With votes in the hands of the people, voters can get a full \" hands on\" voting experience. As to not repeat myself, in this way voters can really understand the voting system and get the idea in their head their vote is going towards their chosen candidate. Popular voting has not only been proven to be the more preferred method of voting, but in my opinion, shall be the established method of voting to use in the future elections.    In conclusion, I strongly feel that we need to change to an election by popular vote.\u00a0 Above all, it is more fair to the people.\u00a0 Citizens would feel that their votes matter more than they do now.\u00a0 People wouldn't have to be worried about if the electors would flip on what they had voted for.\u00a0 Although some say its is absolutely fair throughout all the states, there are still the set backs that come along with keeping an Electoral College.\u00a0 I agree with former presidents, Nixon and Carter, that we need to abolish the Electoral College.\u00a0 All of these reasons show you the problems there are with the current system of electing our President and I know you will agree  Eeveryone should have a say in what goes on where ever it is that they live. We the people make up the government. Who draws the line that states whether or not you are allowed to vote. We do! Therefore we should be able to decied ourselves who can be our president to the United States of America. It is niot fair that we need to elect others to have our submission be made. Even when we tell our electors who we choose, they might turn arouhd and vote for the other person. In  Source 2 \"The indefensible electorial college : why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong by Bradford Plumer\"  backs up my response when stating,\"In the same vein, 'faithless' electors have ocasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please...\". That to me my friend, is not fair at all.  People should have their right to vote for who they think is best. That is why people are given the right to vote. The Electoral College just takes that right away. Presidents who win because of electoral votes, are not fairly chosen because, not many voters agreed on him, the electors did. The candidate that won popular votes, should be President, because most people agree on him and his choices. Let the people's votes count toward presidency.  If one wanted to, an elector can completely disregard the decision of the voters and choose who they want. Considering the ratio of electors in some states to people, it seems completely non-democratic for the votes of some to be more important than the wants of the common people. Some start to feel that they shouldn't vote because their one vote wouldn't have the power to change anything, and wouldn't even ensure the election of the president they want. Another thing that lowers the morale is the absence of candidates in states that can't be won very easily. If a candidate is pretty sure he can't win over a state, he won't visit it because it wouldn't be worth his time. He also wil prioritize large states over small ones because they have more electoral votes. All of these can make a state or person feel as if the election isn't really in their hands, and when people feel like their vote doesn't matter, they don't vote.  Direct voting would be a better way to vote so that everybody felt like their votes really counted towards who they voted for and that they arent getting cheated because one president has more electors supporting them. The electoral college is not based on equality because everybodys votes count differently due to supporters or electors who are pretty much the ones getting the votes. fixing the way people vote and how they vote can change the way some people feel towards the preident no matter who they are. Let the people vote for who they want and not the electors because it would make more people more open to vote than there are now.       In conclusion, the electoral college needs to be extinguished for many reasons. those reasons are because it doesn't let the people vote for who they want and it over rules a notions votes. And because it doesnt show the number of votes as equall. Some may say that it is good because it prevents a tie but if there is a tie then I'm sure htere are better ways to revote. we need government for the people, by the people and that isn't what the electoral college is.    In conclusion, the Electoral College seems unconstitutional, since a variety of issues can occur due to the many problems that could potentially occur. The United States should shift into a more reasonable and logical means of electing our president in our Republic, where everybody is equal. The Electoral College should no longer decide the president based on the possibility of a tie, the possibility for betrayal of trust and disputes due to how close the votes are. The system should change to where the popular opinion should\u00a0 decide on the president of the United States of America, making people believe that their vote will be fairly counted. ",

I personally think that community service is a volunteer job and that people of the community should do it at their own free will. Depending on what type of services the students would provide would vary the response in enthusiasm. My opinion to community service would be that every one needs to do their share in helping.  I believe that community service should be required because no doubt that every teacher wants a self-controlled person in their class, I am not saying that every person will be made to be caring or controlled, but they will know that doing those things do pay off when you look back and think at them. Some studies have also showed that helping out does build a self-made person with respect for themselves and others. This will also make the school look good with all the students who do help to create the community better.  I believe that community service should be a completely voluntary thing. But i do think that you should initiate a school wide punishment for those caught littering on campus.  but the students should have freedom over what they do. At least, if anything, contact the students' parents and ask them for approval. Don't just force them to, though, because it's not right to force students to participate in any activities that they aren't interested in doing. With this, I believe that the students should have the freedom to choose and not have to participate in any activity if they aren't intrigued.  It's always best to give students options, and letting them enjoy what they do best at, but it's not right\u00a0to force them into doing what they don't want to do; yes I agree that after school activities should be in school, and open to all students.  Don't force students into something they don't feel comfortable\u00a0with, but recommend it to them so they can think about it.  I believe that it is a good idea because everyone should be taking a part in making the world a better place.  Overall, I personally think that considering, understanding and learning multiple points of view is very important. Personally, when I am stuck in a situation I try to ask more than one person for advice, because like I explained it can be very beneficial. Plus, it is very important to have options, and not be forced into a particular way to handle something. So the next time you need advice, hopefully you'll ask more than one person!  but I believe that community service will be a value to our education and should be required by your school ",

                "content": "Listening to different ideas may inspire you to tweak you decision. When I had just moved into a different house, I was presented with an age old teenage dilemma: how to decorate my room? Consulting with my parents, sister, friends, and my wise pet dog, I settled on a blue comforter and yellow walls. However, when sometimes you've strained your brain but no solution has been thought up, the presented advice may end up being the one you pick. In the book  Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,  Harry Potter has no idea how to contact Sirius Black. Luckily for him, his friends do. With their help, a plan was hatched with the involvement of invisible gas and breaking into the headmaster's office, all things he wouldn't have thought of himself. My grandmother's saying, \"Our brains are crazy in different ways,\" in this case, is\u00a0an extremely accurate expression.  because even if they are the most studious person in the world that temptation to become distracted will still always be there. Someone who demonstrates this perfectly is my friend Generic_Name. Generic_Name is probably one of the most hard working people I have ever known, not only does he take high level courses for his age but he also does track all while being home schooled. Not only will he deny every offer of a hangout but he will also stay up way later than he should just to finish his latest assignment, but even though he does all of these things I will occasionally catch him logging into Minecraft\u00a0when I know he shouldnt be, and because of this he usually has awful time management skills. This just goes to show how distance learning not only makes it easier to become distracted because of how convenient\u00a0it is but also how it enforces bad study habits because of the lack of a classroom.   seeking multiple opinions before making a hard decision can be beneficial because of the reasons stated above. When I was in second grade, I passed the test to be admitted into the AAP (Advanced Academics Program) in my school. My best friend was also accepted, and wanted me to go to AAP with her, but I didnt really want to go into AAP. I told my parents this, and they agreed it would be best for me to stay in the normal class for on more year. Since I got my parents' opinions, I also felt more secure staying out of the advanced program even though my friend wanted me to do the opposite and go into the program. And so in third grade, I was not in AAP with my best friend, but nonetheless, I was happy and met many new friends in the normal class, some of whom are still my friends today. When I went into fourth grade, however, I decided that I wanted to go into the AAP program. Since I had already gotten in a year\u00a0before, I was not required to retake the test and went in smoothly to the advanced program. In this example, I sought three opinions (my parents and my best friend) in order to make a decision,\u00a0but if I had taken my friend's advice alone, I would have gone into AAP in third grade and not have been as happy as I was in the regular class.\u00a0This shows clearly that  While understandable, this is inaccurate because students already have a lot of responsibilities. For instance, my friend Generic_Name, has a part time job, plays baskeball, and tutors her younger siblings. It would be difficult for her to create a summer project because she has so many other responsbilities. If she would have to design a summer project she wouldn't be able to give her time to her other priorities. Furthermore, making a summer project would result in her being stressed out.  If a student were to work from home, they would choose when they want to work and if they even feel like doing assignments that day. Having this schedule\u00a0teaches them time management which helps them develop the technique for the future when planning out different things. My friend, Generic_Name, has a very hard time planning things such as hanging out with friends, when to complete assignments, etc. She learned how to manage a schedule that incorporates all of her needs and wants into her day. She is able to attend school, go to soccer practice, and still have time for her friends and family. This is one of many life lessons that attending school can give you. When people think of school they think of all the work they have to complete with no time in the day to do it. By developing this schedule it helps them manage their priorities first and helps them incorporate their wants as well.  Students in America struggle throughout their life attending school while accepting the burden of friendships, family and other stresses and anxieties. Summer becomes that safe haven for them, to completely decompress from their issues and take a break from the mental strain of schools, with all the tests, exams and projects that're encompassed\u00a0within it. Students who are allowed the opportunity to design their own project become eager to create a product which displays their learning over the summer. Once in my freshman year, I was given an option to complete a teacher-assigned book report, or to construct an independent book report. Being allowed this opportunity made me eager to chose a book that satisfied my interests, and not be punished to endure reading a four hundred page book about trivial history. This point illustrates the impact that student-designed summer projects can instill, without the students feeling punished by the school. Learning should be a process of critical thinking and analysis, however when this process is interrupted by an external predetermined body it is detrimental to one's education.  For example, my friend lives in her apartment with her older sister who is diagnosed with cancer but still works almost everyday to provide for her family, her cousin who is mentally disabled and cannot work, and her mom who has a medical condition where she has trouble walking. My friend sometimes has to leave school early just to go to her job and works eight hour shifts, five days a week and stays up to do her homework or sometimes isn't able to complete it. Online school or video conferencing would save drastic amounts of time in order for her to be able to work more to provide for her family and be able to pay for online school and make meals for her family, while still getting her education. Overall, online school would be a better option for some students whose family situations may need a little more attention than others  In conclusion, students will not benefit from attending online classes at home as they will get easily distracted and be less motivated to learn. If students are to properly balance their home life and their studies, a more reasonable approach that doesn't compromise their relaxation or student life needs to be found. Also, students who attempt to take an online class at home are more likely to be distracted by the comforts that are at their reach. The inability to forge relationships and connect with peers is another drawback of taking an online class at home. Likewise, the lack of opportunities to partake in in-class discussions creates barriers for students to succeed as active learners. Nobel Peace Prize winner and educational activist Malala Yousafzai once said,\"a paper and pen can change the world.\" Yousafzai overcame many hindrances before she could provide education to the girls in her village, so why do we undermine its importance? Education is a powerful tool that we must use to guide the future, it is not something that we can compromise on for comfort.  Friends are an ideal part of everyone's lives and online course do not provide that, but schools do. My friend, who i just recently met and has been home schooled his whole life until his senior year, found it hard to have friends because he did not know anybody. He is a shy person and does not like interacting with any out-going activities because he did not know how to engage with other people. Because of this, people who go to public schools at a young age are more likely to make friends there and have even more friends the more they grow up and as they enter high school. All in all, online courses do not provide people like friends that are a key part of our lives and help us build our character and self-esteem about each other.  My cousin is home schooled. Her only friends are her neighbors and her teammates on her fencing team. She is a very shy girl and hates talking to people. If she were put into a school with kids her own age she might be different in the way she talks to people. This is going to effect her future in a way that might be difficult for her to get a job, buy a house, etc. Having relationships like those, with other students and teachers, makes getting through school a whole lot easier. These teachers push their students for success and online catting with teachers just doesn't form that close relationship like a teacher you see in person everyday does. I know going to school is hard and annoying, but it's those teachers and my friends that motivate me to go to school and get those positive grades. ",

                "content": "The new \"hands free\" law is a law where no one can hold their phone while driving. This has effected people with older cars and even newer cars to this day. As this law is in set, people have to connect their phone to Bluetooth to be able to talk on the phone. For example, if you're driving and someone calls, you have to have your phone connected to Bluetooth to be able to talk. In some cases this can be bad for the driver and other people driving on the road also. If your phone isn't connected to Bluetooth while you're driving, there can be a high risk of a crash when you're connecting your phone to Bluetooth. In some cases, there could also be an emergency call you have to answer, and people that don't have Bluetooth in their car can be effected by this law  One example of a state that has made using a mobile device while behind the wheel of a vehicle is Georgia. The hands-free law states that \"A driver cannot have a phone in their hand or use any part of their body to support their phone...A driver may not write, send or read any text messages, e-mails, social media or internet data content\"(\"Hands-Free Law\"). The states understand that the use of mobile devices while operating a vehicle is dangerous, and they are starting to enforce that they need to get it under control.  In mosts states it is illegal to even have your cell phone in your hand let alone be using it or talking on the phone while driving. If the law is not enough to persuade people to stop using phones while driving, the dangers of killing people should. Close to five thousand people died due to cell phone related crashes in 2018 (Texting and Driving Statistics 2019, thezebra. com). Even if someone is not on the phone themselves, someone else on the road could be  For instance, Georgia enacted Joshua's Law in 2007 requiring 16 year old drivers to complete driver's ed. The state also recently approved the Hands-Free law, which in essence eliminated any and all distracted driving practices. States recognize the problems that come with cell phone use while driving and have taken steps to fix them. This is evidence enough that in no way, shape, or form should drivers be allowed to use cell phones while operating a vehicle. For further support, there are about 9 people killed and 1,000 injured daily in the United States because of distracted driving (\"The Dangers of Distracted Driving\"), thus the popularity of cell phone use while driving is a damaging practice in the U.S. and should be ended immediately.  Thousands of deaths could be prevented each year if everyone were to simply put their phone down while driving. No notification, song, or post is worth compromising the safety of the general public. Ensuring others' security should be a priority for all americans. When one fourth of car accidents involve cell phones, there is a serious problem. Complete focus and concentration on the road while driving should just be common sense. Keep the phone down.   Police officers have the ability to give a driver a citation/ticket for texting while driving. However, a significantly large number of drivers have found a loophole to evade getting a ticket and/or citation. They would not text and drive but instead they would have their cell phones in their hand but not actually text and drive. In order to counteract this loophole, some states have enforced a policy which states that a driver can be penalized for being in possession of a cell phone/mobile device when the vehicle is in motion. These policies are implemented so that no harm can occur due to cell phone usage while driving.  Using a phone while driving, or being distracted by any piece of technology for that matter, is not acceptable. Lives have been lost, many have been injured, and vehicles have been totaled, all because of a call or text message. Laws must be put in place, and knowledge must be spread to end this practice. When driving, please put your phone down, and instead focus your attention to the task at hand.    You need to keep both hands on the steering wheel to be the most effective driver. But, every time you text, read messages or talk on a cell phone without a hands-free device, not only is your focus compromised, but you can't keep both hands on the wheel. Phone use when you are driving can also affect your alertness of the surroundings, which can make you prone to collisions. Also, distraction and inattention are the number one cause of traffic accidents and it is estimated that nearly every collision involves one of these two related errors. Driving takes all your attention and it is your responsibility to keep your eyes on the road, so put down the phones and pay attention to the road.  The use of mobile devices while on the road leads to distracted driving which means that the driver is less likely to notice road and safety signals, Pedestrians and the signals coming from other vehicles. Failure to heed these signals has led to injuries and death that could have been prevented had the driver not been using a mobile device while on the wheel. In the U.S., there are laws banning the use of mobile devices or the act of texting while someone is on the wheel.  The National Safety Council reports that cell phone use while driving leads to 1.6 million crashes each year. Nearly 390,000 injuries occur each year from accidents caused by texting while driving. 1 out of every 4 car accidents in the U.S. is caused by texting and driving (\"Texting and Driving Accident Statistics\"). Cell phone distraction rates are alarmingly high and can pose serious safety risks. You can be charged with murder for texting and driving. Texting is the most alarming distraction sending or reading a text takes your eyes off the road for a couple of seconds. Using a cellphone while driving creates enormous potential for deaths and injuries on  U.S. roads. In 2017 alone 3,166 people were killed in motor vehicle crashes including distracted drivers. Texting and driving is against the law (\"The Dangers of Distracted Driving\").  There are plenty of other distractions that go on when driving a motorized vehicle, but the use of phones is most caused. These deaths and accidents from distracted driving with your phones can be very managed. If people were to follow the law of not using them in the car and to be more careful then these outrages percentages will become more and more less. Also, I would like to express the fact that there are many options in vehicles that allow you to use your devices via Bluetooth and voice control. So, if there was an emergency you can answer and talk on the phone without even having to pick up your phone and looking away. This concludes my essay I strongly believe in not using your devices while driving and I hope to have expressed the effect is has. ",

                "content": "The implications of technology that can detect emotions simply by reading the muscles in the face sound truly remarkable. The thought that one can tell what another is thinking simply by plugging data or maybe even a picture into an algorithm sounds like fiction, but may soon be a reality. The article, \"Making Mona Lisa Smile\" by Nick D'Alto briefly discusses the possible use of such technology in a classroom. The system could examine student's faces, and if they read to be unengaged or uninterested, could adjust the lesson to make learning more interesting to that group of students. That type of technology could revolutionize learning, and customly tailor lesson plans to the feelings of students on any given day.  New technology is being introduced to mankind almost every second in this world, and now, the latest techonology is a computer program called the Facial Action Coding System which can identify a person's emotions. The question is whether this technology is actually valuable and for what it could be used for. Experts suggest this technology could be used in a classroom to identify the state of mind of a student to adjust the lesson they are trying to comprehend. But, even though this technology may be helpful to teachers trying to keep students active and engrossed in their lessons, the question arises of whether this techonlogy is actually worth the recources or whether what experts think is a great idea is actually an invasion of privacy.  Dr. Huang is talking about the device using video images to pick up the emotions of each person. Dr. H states \"using video imagery, The new emotion recognition software tracks these facial movments in a real face or on a painted face.\" This quote brings to light that the machine can read emotions but one could say since it is still in new development that not all of the bugs or glitches have been worked out not only that but you also have to devote more resources to keep the machine working which can average to be a heafty hit to your wallet.  The article states that the technology associates each emotion with \"characteristic movements of the facial muscles\" and then uses those movements to calculate the spectrum of emotions based on their facial display. But some people show emotions in various ways, and the technology most likely cannot accomodate for the many different ways people express the same emotion. For example, if a student has a resting face that seems generally happy, the system might confuse this dazed face as a satisfied face and think that the student is happy with their lessons when they are actually confused or not paying attention. In the same way, if a student has a resting face that looks naturally sad, the system may think they are unhappy with their lessons, even if the student feels they are learning a lot. A lot of students also try to hide their emotions, like frusteration or sadness, with a happier look on their face, and even though the article states that the system can detect a \"false smile\", it cannot always be accurate as a person may be good at hiding their emotions and displaying a genuine smile. Therefore, since technology is not always accurate and because human beings are so various in the way they behave, the technology would not be useful in a classroom where it may misread a student's state of mind and lead them in the wrong path of education.  New software has been created to determine the facial expressions of students. It uses technology to give data as to what emotions someone is feeling such as happiness, sadness, and boredom. These technologies are possibly going to be used in classrooms to help students learn better based on their emotions towards the lesson that they are learning.  The Facial Action Coding System is an unnecesscary piece of equipment. The software that would be able to detect the emotions of an individual would have several negative affects on society. The reading of emotions is a useful tool when it is detected by someone's natural instinct, but it would not be helpful to only have an understanding on someone's emotions due to the results given on a screen.  Every living thing on planet earth has emotions. These emotions have been used since the beginning of time to express the feelings of the people around you. However, these emotions can be decieving. Someone could say they are happy, when really they are angry or upset. This is where the Facial Action Coding System comes into play. The FACS is a software that detects human emotion by tracking muscles in the face. For example, when you are happy, muscles in your face move up, and when you are sad, they move down, FACS tracks this and calculates your emotions. The creators of this software, Prof. Thomas Huang and Prof. Nicu Sebe are the leading experts of developing better ways for humans and computers to communicate. There are still some questions surrounding the usefulness of FACS, like what could this software actually be used for? One of the ways FACS may be used is in classrooms.  The technology is able to identfy a human's true emotions, but that will not alter the way that person feels.  According to the article \"Making Mona Lisa Smile,\" there is a new technology called the Facial Action Coding System (FACS) that enables computers to identify human emotions. This technology is relatively brand new. It creates a 3-D computer model of all fourty-four major muscles in the face that move like human muscles as well. Then, psychologists have classified six basic emotions that are associated with different movements in the facial mucles. This new technology could result in many benefits in our community as well as all around the world  There's a new kind of technology called Facial Action Coding System, or FACS, which enables computers to identify human emotions. The use of this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is very valuable ",

                "content": "This is why swing states are so important to the canditates, they know that the chances of them winning the votes in the other party's states are almost impossible, so they must gather all of the votes they can from the states that are known for their swing-like tendencies. It also goes the other way, each candidate trusts that their own party's states will vote for them, so there is no need to waste the money and campaign. Unless its the primary elections, candidates don't typically campaign where they know that the votes are all but set in stone. It's like going grocery shopping, if you know that you are allergic to peanut butter and you already have all the jam you need, you will only go for the special bread that everybody fights for right? The candidates are the same, they don't go after what they already have and what they can't have, only what they might earn, or else it's just a waste of money, so nobody should be able to complain about a candidates campaigning.  Since most of the big states already have their votes planned out on who is going to win them over, president-to-be's don't try to persuade them because they know they have those votes. Mostly they try to change the swing states, or the smaller states because they could change from Democratic to Republican during anytime in the election. If everyone had a say in the election, more people would be inclined to vote and there would be more input into who became the next 4 year leader of this nation.  This might lead the small states to not vote because they feeel that they would not make a difference. Source #3 claim the following, \" So, other things being equal, a large state gets more attention from presidential candidates in a campaign than a small state does....\" When bigger states have more electoral votes, the candidates will be lead to thinking that if they get the bigger states, for example California who gets 55 electoral votes, to be in their favor then they might have a bigger chance at winning which will have the small states, like Hawaii who only gets 3 electoral votes, thinking that they have no say as to who gets to be their president. This claim is supported by source #3 when it is stated, \"\u00a0 Knowing their vote will have no effect, they have less incentive to pay attention to the campaign than they would have if the president were picked by popular vote\".  Most states in the electoral college is based on a \"winner take all\" system; if the candidate gets the majority of votes in that state, that candidate gets the electors (Source 1). This means most candidates focus in on the states they know that they have a chance of winning, and focus on going after \"swing states\" (Source 2).\u00a0 If a candidate was to get the majority in Texas, Florida, and California, the three biggest swing states, the candidate would have 122 electoral votes, almost half of the 270 votes necessary to win (Sources 1 and 3).  For instance, the states of california has many electoral points for candidate to win an election. I believe there are fifty-three for that states because they have many representatives. If the majority of the people in the state vote for a democrat or a republicin the electoral points goes to either one of them. Giving that candidate big points to even take a lead in the election  In Source 2, paragraph 12 it states, \"Perhaps most worrying is the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote.\" This is a big worry because the electoral college holds a total of 538 votes which is definetely possible to cause a tie. If this were to happen, then the vote would be thrown to the House of Representatives where state delegations would vote on the president. Then the concept of the presidential campaigns would become pointless because the point of campaining is to try to win over large, swing states to ensure more votes. Because the bigger the states population, the more votes they hold in the electoral college. But that would only work if it was in the Senates hands because the amount of representatives in the Senate for each state is based off of population, whereas the amount of representatives in the House of Representatives is always two for each state. So if the vote was thrown into the House of Representatives hands, then whichever candidate who holds claim over the most states, regardless of size, would almost automatically win the election because each state holds equal say in their vote.  In an election their really is a process of voting and voting again. Instead of couting the number of people who want a certain president and so on. We are viewed as a state and some states having more say than other even if the votes are in the same margin. This is the reason why some states are focused on more by the candidates and are heavily educated on the topic and given more attention than smaller states whose votes wont change much. an even bigger problem is te fact that most states operate on a winner-take-all basis so even a slight majority vote one way will give that person all of the votes. A very worrying prospect as expressed in source two is the possibility of a tie. in which the election would be given to the house of representatives. Each state only gets on vote so a representative representing 500,000 people would have as much say as representatives representing 35 million people.  I can see how this could support changing to election by popular vote, and how it could be reasonable. If our president was chosen by popular vote, then he would visit all of the states, trying to win them over. However, there are some strong arguments against this. To begin with, one man would have to visit 50 states, and even if he only visited the majority, there is still a posibility that the state will not vote for him anyways, in the end. If we keep the Electoral College, then the majority of votes in a state would count, not his popularity. As a fourteen year old, I can relate this to highschool. A student can be the most popular student in the school, but they can also be the most rude and mean. And while another student may not be popular, they can be the nicest in the school. If the president was chosen by a popular vote, he might just end up being the worst thing that could happen to the country.  Source 3 brings up the fact that no region in the United States has enough electoral votes to elect a president. The \"winner-take-all\" system further benefits this, because in order to win, candidates have to focus their attention on states where their majority vote is insecure. They will not focus on regions where they have essentially secured the majority rule and therefore secured all the electoral votes. In popular vote, they would have to focus extensively on those regions, as the few that are not in the majority would need convincing. Source 3 goes into detail as to why a regionally picked candidate is not a proper show of the will of the people. It states that \"The residents of other regions are likely to feel disenfranchised - to feel that thier votes do not count, that their new preident will have no regard for their interests...\", and so having a trans-regional appeal is essential to properly representing the will of United States citizens  but consider this: a swing state such as Florida with over 20 electoral votes could go to a candidate who could have won by a 51 to 49 percent margin. This means that all the voters who voted for the other candidate no longer count, making the electoral college ineffective at voicing the opinions of the populous. ",

                "content": "Overall, Policy 1 is a better policy because it still allows students to sometimes contact others with their cell phones. Today, cell phones are used by the majority of Americans multiple times. To take away their cell phones wouldn't be right. In some situations, students need them to call or text others to help them for whatever. Policy 1 works best because they have the chance to contact parents or friends when they need to, but they won't get distracted during class when they are turned off. This policy allows them to take care of anything they may need to, yet still be able to focus in class.  As you can see, their are many more cons then there are pros for cell phones allowed during class. Policy 2 is the right choice because it allows students to get in touch with whoever they need to contact, It can keep a student from cheating and save them the trouble that comes along with it, and it is also a way to slow down rumors, and a save a child's reputation. All just by removing cell phones from school.  . Lets say that students are in class and they feel the urge to text because they have not used the phone that day. They will want to use it in class but they will do it secretly so the teacher wont take it away. For example there was this kid in my class and while we were in the middle of the lesson he would take out the phone while the teacher had her back to us and start using it. If you put the policy that will let us use our cell phones in school during lunch periods and free time then we will have enough texting done so that we will not need to text anymore until school is finished or until their next free time.  Although I understand why you would reconsider the policy I believe it could go either way.  Some students may take advantage of the policy and secretly use it in class.  Others might take embarrassing photos of somebody else and ruin their life.  The only way to stop this from happening is to ban cell phones for good, however that can also take away the privileges that some students deserve, so what should happen to the policy?  Here is my answer.  First of all, if students have cell phones then they will be tempted to use it and might get in trouble if they use it in class secretly because they are not allowed to use them in school  This could improve their studies if they stay more focused in class because they feel well respected. This could also help they pay attention more in class if they are not texting during the teachers lesson. The teacher can not always see if a student is texting, so the pupil could easily get away with it. During a free time, students would be able to get all of their important texts to their contacts, and be able to focus more in class. This will improve the grades of students, and help prevent students from being held back or failing a class. It could even keep kids out of trouble.  Of course they would be turned off in class as they should. There are so many reasons that we use phones as much as we do and taking them away will cause a tension like no other. The good outweighs the bad in this situation for many reasons and I am prepared to prove that.  As a current student in middle school, I have learned how children use cell phones. If you are reconsidering the cell phone policy, I believe the second one is the only way to go. Children in this school may sneak their cell phones into class without the teacher ever knowing if they are not banned. This will also lead to students doing poorly in class because they won't be paying attention to the teacher. Also, the use of cell phones in a wrong way can cause a student to get hurt. Overall, I believe your second policy to ban cell phones in class is the best choice because after being a student in school, I know what will happen if they are allowed in school.  In U.S. History, for instance, my teacher Generic_Name would talk through the notes very quickly, so it was difficult for me to keep up, especially since I am a slow writer. Fortunately, Generic_Name makes the powerpoints available on blackboard, so I use that during class, but I am so invested in trying to write down all the notes that I miss the important information that he was explaining. In this situation, it would have been beneficial to attend that class from home because I could listen to his lecture intently and then take the notes afterward, which I would not have been able to do in class because Generic_Name disapproves of people not taking notes.  They could take out and use their phones when teachers are not watching, and use them without being noticed. And when somebody gets caught, they just get angry at the school and have their parents come up to the school to get back the confiscated phone. This will give you no progress, as students would still use their phones in class and just get them taken away. Even if they have the chance of getting caught, they would still text or call somebody if they felt that it was something important. ",

The idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers is supported through Venus' vast similarites to Earth, which is why humans have such interest in this particular planet. The idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the presented dangers is conveyed through Venus' proximity. The idea that Venus is a worthy pursuit despite its hostile environment is supported through the innovation in machines that could make the close-up exploration of Venus possible. The author believes that sometimes humans cannot let curiosity, imagination, and innovation be trampled by the dangers and doubts. Humans cannot live in fear all the time. The human spirit always demands that humans continue striving towards knowing more.    In \"The Challenge of Exploring Venus\" the author supports Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presnts through his analysis of hovering, silicon carbide, and mechanical computers. He supports his ideas with evidence and also the analysis he has with his knowledge by research. He uses facts, and not a lot of opinions to express his ideas and belief that Venus is a worthy pursuit. He colcudes his argument that humanity's travels on Earth and beyond should never even be limited by threats of dangers or doubts. Without that, knowledge will be expanded and fuel the innovation of the human world and beyond.  Venus having an average of 800 degrees fahrenheit on its surface, make's it virtually inhabitable to humans. These conditons are so extreme the author explains that \"such an environment would crush even a submarine accustomed too diving to the deepest parts of our oceans.\" Venus has very harsh conditions and it make's it virtually impossible to explore it from the surface and proposes a tough challenge on finding alternatives ways to explore it. Although, NASA has proposed an idea to explore the harsh planet. NASA believes we can explore the planet from a distance approximately 30 miles away. The author explains that the pressure would be comparable to sea level on earth, tempature would be around 170 degrees. The author states that \"Not easy conditions but survivable for humans.\" The mission would propose great danger and it would be a expontential battle, but with the right people and technology it could be done and accomplished. The benefit is the knowledge gained from this great planet that has had the world beat for a long time, it is time to step up to the challenge and explore Venus for the people of this world.  People are facinated with the Man on the Moon and the idea of Martians, but most people do not think about life on Venus. Venus is the second planet from the sun and shares many geographical features with Earth. However, studying this planet is made difficult by the dense and toxic atmosphere, high temperatures, and violent weather. Despite this, some people think that Venus should still be explored, and the author of \"The Challenge of Exploring Venus\" is of this opinion.  In \"The Challenge of Exploring Venus\", the author argues the point that exploring Venus is worth the effort and risks exhibited. The author claims that, despite the harsh conditions and deadly atmosphere, this planet is worth travelling to and observing, due to its being the \"nearest option for a planetary visit\".  In the text it says, \" Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere. On the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet.\" In addition, the article also states, \"Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system, even though Mercury is closer to our sun.\" The conditions on that planet Venus are much worse than on Eath, the planet contains such heat that it is over 800 degrees Fahrenheit.   In \"The Challenge of Exploring Venus,\" the author describes why putting a man on the moon seems like a walk in the park compared to the horrendous obstacles preventing humans from pushing the frontier with visiting one of Earth's neighbors, Venus. The thick atmosphere is toxic to us. The clouds of sulfuric acid, the incredibly high temperatures on the planet's surface, and pressure would present challenges to mankind and its technology.  Paragraph 4 states, \"Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system. Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth\" (The Challenge of Exploring Venus). If Venus could've supported human life long ago, it is likely the planet still can. The scientific facts throughout this statement support the author's claim by having a reliable source of information, supporting the idea. Paragraph 4 reads, \"Today, Venus still has some features that are analogous to those on Earth. The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters\" (The Challenge of Exploring Venus). Venus already has Earth-like landscapes and other similar formations. This supports the author's idea of exploring Venus because it is so similar to Earth, the chances of survival are higher than any other planet.  He states that Venus is often referred to as Earth's \"twin\". This is because Venus and Earth are close in size, density, and at some points in orbit are the closest planets in the solar system. It is also believed that at one point, Venus was a lot like Earth is now. \"The Challenge of Exploring Venus\" states, \"Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our soloar system.\". The article goes on to say Venus most likely had large oceans that supported life, and the planet has things like craters, valleys, and mountains that we also have here on Earth. The author including these details helps get the point across that Venus is a lot like Earth, and with the little research been done already, we've found so much. This helps readers understand that the longer Venus is studied, the more we will learn about it.  Venus is a challenge to get to with its hot surface, with its thick atmosphere, and atmospheric pressure. But scientists and astronomers are facinated by Venus, because they believe it had oceans and could have supported various forms of life. ",

                "content": "Your on a trip to california from indiana and your afraid to fly so you drive with the new driverless car. You get bored because you dont have to do anything,and your getting tired. So you fall asleep in the car; up ahead there is a broken bridge and your car couldnt wake you up and you missed the detour because your car was incapable of doing its job. Fortunatly your car has a sensor to that aplies the brakes when the driver does not wake up and take the wheel.  The only major issue that could arise is the problematic moment in which a \"driverless\" car's system would break. This would leave not only the passenger in the car in danger depending on the severity of the car failure, but it would also leave the other communters on the road in danger as well.  there aren't as many traffic jams.  But it may also put them in danger without them knowing. Another example, if you are a handicap, legally blind, or deaf, you may be in grave danger. The car again is on autopilot and is driving through a neighborhood and there are signs everywhere to when and where to stop, if there is construction, or there are people crossing the streets. You come to a stop at a stop sign, you are not paying attention, you are oblivious to your surroundings when doing other things. The car will go head but there is a car coming from the other side of the street where there is no stop sign. You and the other person collide.  if we were to just not use vehicles a few days out of every month, then these recouces may slowly start to build back up.  they are hazardous and in some cases deadly when a vehicle is involved.  There are situations there a person is the best option. Unless the car can think for it self. The drivrless car is too unpredicatable and can put peoples lives in danger. Accidents occur all the time, i don't believe a driverless car can avoid an ongoing accident. Then there are situations with police, or stolen cars. Would the car give away its owner if they were on the run from the police? How would traffic stops work, would the car be so perfect to not break the law? The car could be harboring fugitives or runways or even kidnapped victims. The car wouldnt be smart enought to know, its going to do what its told and drive.  If an area with all driverless cars is made, what happens when the self driving cars do finally mess up and crash into another driverless car? Who should be blamed?  but the car may have a flaw. This again will bring conflict and debate. This can lead people to believe that driverless cars are unsafe and unproductive and is a liabilty. But say you were paying attention to your surroundings, instictively, you would look left and right. The car will go foward but, there is a car coming from the other side (remember there is no stop sign for the other car to stop at) you and that person collide. Again, the car is to have warned you but if you were alert, you would have taken control of the car when driving through a neighborhood.  It could end up causing you to end up in a wreck, or maybe it won't slow down and the brakes won't work. Even though you are alert, what can you do if something goes wrong? Nothing. If the car can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves there is not a whole lot you can do to stop it. You just never know with a driverless car. You are putting yourself ar risk while you are in the car because you are not 100% in control of the car and that is not safe. ",

                "content": "Although many arguments cannot be proven until they are out and on the road in regularity, driverless cars should not be created for normal use. They can cause many problems on the road. They are unsafe and unentertaining to the occupants. They may have navigation issues when faced with and accident or a work zone or some form of traffic diversion. If driverless cars are produced, they may not stay popular for any long period of time.  Driveless cars are not perfectly save and can cause major problems when driving in places with construction or complicated traffics or complicated driving routes and if the driver does not take control of the car, the driver and the passengers in the cars and other people can get seriously injured. Driveless cars are so doubted for their safety that certain states have limited the use or banned them from being driven or tested in their state roads, a few states who have done this is Calforina, Nevada, Florida, and the District of Columbia. Driveless cars who notify people when to take over if the emergency are still not that safe as they have no effective to notify the driver that he should take over, many companies have tried different techniques but none of them have found an effective way to get the drivers attention in case the drivers needs to take over because the car cant handle the roads or sencario it is in. Without an effective way to get the drivers attention, to take over if the time is needed, the car can have an major accident because the driver attention was caught to take over the car and the car couldn't handle the situation, leading to an accident. Even with accidents the problems do not end their, many people and car manducatures and companies do not know if you blame the driver or the manfucaturing. With this not settled out, you getting in an accident because techonolgy an compnay has put in a car was incapable of handling safe driving could make you be blamed for the accident and making you pay alot of money to fix your car and damages while the company who put this faulty techonolgy in the car, walk away with no problems.  The biggest problem with driverless cars is that it is difficult to enable them to manuever around unexpected problems like car accidents or construction areas.  A myriad of problems could arise pertaining to driverless cars  Every year hundreds of thousands of people are killed in car accidents.  Many of those accidents are a result of neglegence on the fault of the driver.  Driving while under the influence, driving and texting, driving and making calls, driving and eating, driving and putting make-up on; all are things that cause car accidents that could be avoided with driverless cars. With driverless cars, passengers would be able to go on the road and not have to deal with the stress that comes with driving around on busy roads, or the stress that comes with taking into consideration bad drivers, other people driving under the influence, or just other drivers in general.  In my opinion, driverless cars do not need to be developed. The science and technology involved is susceptible to malfunction and could result in many problems. There is a lack of safety when it comes to these cars and various states agree. Also, a driver could be clueless and not listen to the alerts given be the car when it was trying to gain their attention. This could lead to an accident or something even worse. For these reasons, I oppose the development of driverless cars.  No one is perfect and accidents do happen but in a driverless car who is to blame? This issue could cause serious law cases and court battles over injuries or damages indured in a crash with a driverless car.  Younger generations of people in our modern world are becoming increasingly attuned to smart technology,with developments such as the smartphone, smart watch, etc. spreading throughout the nation. The introduction of a driverless car would further stimulate this already existing dependency, which could lead to problems down the road.  I honestly think driverless cars are an unproductable invention and can cause danger.  Driverless technology has to be understood by the consumer. If the consumer does not know how this technology works, it could cause some serious damage.  ",

This means that we do not vote directly vote for our new president, but instead vote for electors that vote for a candidate running for office. Though many individuals are in favor of keeping the Electoral College, if kept, it will continue to cause problems in our nation.  The Electoral College was established in the Constitution by the founding fathers. \"The Electoral College process consists of the selection of electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for president and Vice President, and the counting of the electoral votes by Congress\" is stated in source 1. This is process has been around for decades, but things have changed.  In order to understand the flaws in the electoral college, you need to know what the electoral college is, and how it came to be. \"The Electoral College process consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for President and Vice President, and the counting of the electoral votes by Congress.\" (Office of the Federal Register 2). This system was created by the founding fathers as a compromise between the congressional vote and the popular vote. However there was a reason for this new, seperated voting system. During their time the founding fathers where among the most educated men in the country. Back then education was not standard and very few people could read or write. The founding fathers did not want uneducated citizens voting on the individual who would lead the country. So they created a system where the uneducated would vote for a group of educated men, who would in turn vote on a president. Thus the electoral college was born.  What is the electoral college?\u00a0 The electoral college is a process which consists of the selection of the electors, meeting where they vote for president, and the counting of the votes.\u00a0 The real question is, is the electoral college helping us or is it just bringing our government farther towards disaster?  Having electoral voters instead of having the popular vote system is unfair to all. Basically the electoral college process consists of only a selection of the senators. The founding father have established this messed\u00a0 up system in which it compromise between the election of the president by a vote in congress. It is highly unfair because of the winner-take-all system in each state.  It's the Tuesday after the first Monday in November, can you guess what it is? It's election day! Every four years, nearly every person in America will vote to choose a new President, or do we? Yes, we live in a democracy where we can vote for who runs out country, but do we really make the descision? The Electoral College is a phase where electors, of a candidate running for president, come together and decide for who is the President, Vice President, and include the countings of the electoral votes from Congress. The person who runs for President has a select group of people known as electors, which are typically chosen by that person's political party  The Electoral College is a method of voting for President and Vice President that was produced by our founding fathers in the articles of the Constitution. The Electoral College has been in use for centuries, but it is time that we disregard it.  When the Constitution of the United States was written our founding fathers decided on an Electoral College as the way to ellect the president instead of a direct vote. The Electoral College is a process that makes a compromise between the popular vote of the citizens and the Congressional vote. When citizens vote for president they are actually voting for a member of the Electoral College that is going to select their president, rather than the citizens voting for the president themselves. The Electoral College is made of 538 electors, the number of electors from each state varies depending on the states Congressional delegation. Washington D.C. is counted as a state for this process and alloted only three electors.  Every four years, citizens of the United States ages eighteen and up, gather at local voting locations to elect the President, our government leader. From Washington to Obama we have always elected our leaders as such. The Constitution has given us our way to vote- the Electoral College. This process, of course, consists of our 538 electors, the place where they meet to vote, and the counting of said votes. But how effective is this process? ",

Overall Mr. Senator, I believe that the Electoral College should not be used to determine who becomes the President of the United States instead they should use popular vote. This being because the people are not directly voting, the candidates are just focusing on getting the votes and not on the people. And lastly because it can be considered unpredictable with the \"faithless electors\" and bais state legislatures.  To conclude I belive that my state senator should remove the electoral colleges. To change the election by popular vote for the president of the United States. For the fact that voters vote not for the president but for a slate of electors. Who can always defy the will of the people. It should also be removed because its simply unfair to the voters. There votes may or may not be counted or may vote for the wrong person or oppsite party. The Electoral College is unfair, outdated, and irrational.     I believe that there should be no more Electoral College because it doesn't give people much of a say in who becomes President because there is just a commitee of people that are voting for the President.  After reviewing information about the Electoral College, I believe that the Electoral College should not be used in deciding or electing the president of the United States.  I think that it is criticall that we change the idea of an Electoral College to the idea that all of the people in the United States are able to contribute equally to who should be the next president based on what they believe is right  You should keep the Electoral College because the founding fathers of the United States Of America established it when they made the constitiution.

The article \"The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong\" written by Bradford Plumer states, \"The single best argument against the electoral college is what we might call the disaster factor. The American people should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century; the sytem allows for much worse. Consider that state legislators are technically responsible for picking electors, and that those electors could always defy the will of the people\". This means that the people never know if their electors are going to go back on their word and vote for another candidate.  Referencing to Par. 11 Source 2 Bradford Plumer describes on how \"The American People should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election in a century; the system allows for much worse.\" and \"that those elctors could always defy the will of the people.\" in Par. 9 \"according to a Gallup poll in 2000, taken shortly after Al-Gore-Thanks to the quirks of the electoral college-won the popular vote but lost the presidency.\" Many problems that would not ocurr if our way of voting were to be simplified into popular vote.  from the article \"The indefensible electoral colllege\" it says it was the biggest election crisis in the century\". Consider that state legislatures are technically responsible for\u00a0 picking electors, and that those electors wioll always defy the will of the people. If we the people vote for our choice to run this country their should not be any of these fiascos.  Lets talk about abolishin the electoral college. When you vote, do you think you vote for the president? No. When you vote u dont vote for the president you vote for the slate of electors, who in turn elect the president. The people of America should consider themselfs lucky that the 2000 fiasco election was the biggest election crisis in a century, says the article in setion 2. Honestly if the article syas that Bob Dole was right why even have the electoral college!  For example, evidence in the article \" The Indefensible Electoral College: why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong\" by Bradford Plumer, in 1960\u00a0 there was an indicident pertaining to the election of John F. Kennedy. In his case, segregationists from Louisiana were planning to (and just about succeeded) in replacing the Democratic electors with electors to whom opposed JFK.\u00a0 This article also brings up another problem with the elctoral college votes in the year of 2000 listing it as the \"2000 fiasco\" and \"biggest crisis of the century.\"  Richard Nixon, Jimmy carter, Bob Dole, and plenty of oothers think that it should change because according to a gallup poll in 2000 taken shortlyafer Al Gore he wonn the popular vote but lost the presidency dur to the quirks of the electoral college. in the Electoral College system people vote not for the prresident but for a slate of electors as i had said in the last pargrraph who in turn elect or the president. electors could be anyon not holding public office. voters sometimes control who there electors vote for. wich makes the voters sometimes get confsed about the electors wich makes them vote for the wrong candidate. In the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in the centery. in 1960 segegaters in Louisiana legslater nearly suceeddin replacing Democratic electora with new electors. So that the popular vote for Kennedy woulld not have actually gone to Kennedy. So them electors in the same vein they qould have to occasionally refuse to vote for the partys cannidate and cast a decideiing vote to who ever they please.  Just look at what happened in 1960, when racist legislators tried to replace the democtratic electors\u00a0 chosen by popular vote in order to sabotage John F. Kennedy's chances. Then yet another electoral disaster occured in 2000. Both of these events could very easily happen again and the consequences of such mistakes are unfathomable. History has been proven to repeat itself, and this is no exeption. Who's to say that electors won't just ignore the wishes of voters or that legislators won't manipulate the system? When it comes to choosing our leade, whose actions will ultimately decide whether or not America will continue to survive and thrive, it would be a huge mistake to leave this resposibility to one group of individuals. After all, nobody is perfect.  Many people remember the problem of the 2000 presidential election. The Electoral College had very effectively exemplified its flaws and unefficient ways of opperating. Al Gore and George Bush were running apposed, and despite winning the overall popular vote in the country, Gore lost the election to Bush. Bush had received the most electoral votes, therefore winning him the presidency. Basically, despite the fact that more citizens chose Gore to be president, Bush won out. In our constitution it is written that citizens of the United States have an unwavering right to vote and select who gets put into office. In this case, it sounds more like the number of electoral votes has an unwavering right to select who gets put into office.  As you probably already know, each state's \"...entitled allotment of electors equals the number of memebers in its Congressional delegation...\" (Source One, paragraph 3). Most represntatives spend most of their time campaining in places like New York and California that the small states such as Rhode Island arent even visited. \"In the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see candidates at all...\" and that campaign was refered to as a \"fiasco\" in which the Electoral College caused a dispute (Selection 2, paragraph 13).\u00a0 ",

This evidence is only given in the last paragraph of the article and is not mentioned anywhere else. Also, the author lists many of the dangers of traveling to Venus, but does not dictate why it is worth the risk of exploring the planet.  In Paragraph 8, the author claims, \"Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiousity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors.\" The author brought up the word \"challenge\" again,  The author supports their claim by giving numerous details and supporting his ideas.\"Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endbeavors.\" A big issue that is brought up are the harsh conditions Venus brings. \"On the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Farenheight, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet.\" Knowing this, you might think that they must stop there with their research because there's no way they can discover Venus now because it's to dangerous and harsh. That is false, \"NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray.\" Their solution is to have a vehicle hovering over Venus that would avoid the unfriendly ground conditions by staying up and out of their way. It would still be toasty but not deathly. The author claims, \" Not easy conditions, but survivable for humans.\" The author supports his claim by saying yes, the temperature is a challenge they will face, but NASA has one particular compelling idea for sending humans to study Venus, and they will continue to challenge themselves and find solutions to these conflicts they face.  To illistrate, \"...human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors\" (8). The author explains how humans are naturally curious, and how this curiosity often times leads them to dangerous situations. Studying Venus has its dangers, but it is no different. Also stated, \"Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation\" (8). The author is promoting curiosity because it leads us to new things. Curiosity can overcome the fear of danger when exploring Venus to help us learn new things about the planet. To summarize, the power of curiosity in people is something the author uses to support their opinion of Venus being worth it to explore.  In conclusion, it is important Venus is continued to be studied and researched. The author of \"The Challenge of Exploring Venus\" does a great job of conveying to his audience why studying Venus is important even though it is dangerous. In the last paragraph, the author says, \"Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value...\". Studying Venus can help advance many things, and our knowledge of other planets could grow from this as well. There have been many safe ways found to study Venus, so it should be done. The author also states that, \"Our travels on Earth should not be limited by dangers and doubts...\". This quote also shows that the author believes the study of Venus should continue even though it can be dangerous. If we didn't study things just because they're dangerous, then we would have nothing dicovered. The author of this article believes the study of Venus should continue, and does very well at conveying that by telling the audience Earth and Venus are a lot alike, gives new, safer ways to study Venus, and gives examples of technology that could also make the study of Venus a lot safer and easier.  In \"The Challenge of Exploring Venus,\" the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents is supported through Venus' vast similarities to Earth, Venus' proximity to Earth, and the innovation in machines by researchers that could make them work long enough to expand mankind's knowledge on Venus. The idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers is supported through Venus' vast similarites to Earth, which is why humans have such interest in this particular planet. The idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the presented dangers is conveyed through Venus' proximity. The idea that Venus is a worthy pursuit despite its hostile environment is supported through the innovation in machines that could make the close-up exploration of Venus possible. The author believes that sometimes humans cannot let curiosity, imagination, and innovation be trampled by the dangers and doubts. Humans cannot live in fear all the time. The human spirit always demands that humans continue striving towards knowing more.    In \"The Challenge of Exploring Venus,\" the author describes why putting a man on the moon seems like a walk in the park compared to the horrendous obstacles preventing humans from pushing the frontier with visiting one of Earth's neighbors, Venus. The thick atmosphere is toxic to us. The clouds of sulfuric acid, the incredibly high temperatures on the planet's surface, and pressure would present challenges to mankind and its technology.  Yet, the author sees that mankind cannot be afraid of the risks when the rewards are so great. In \"The Challenge of Exploring Venus,\" the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents  In \"The Challenge of Exploring Venus\" the author supports Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presnts through his analysis of hovering, silicon carbide, and mechanical computers. He supports his ideas with evidence and also the analysis he has with his knowledge by research. He uses facts, and not a lot of opinions to express his ideas and belief that Venus is a worthy pursuit. He colcudes his argument that humanity's travels on Earth and beyond should never even be limited by threats of dangers or doubts. Without that, knowledge will be expanded and fuel the innovation of the human world and beyond.

                "content": "New technology is being introduced to mankind almost every second in this world, and now, the latest techonology is a computer program called the Facial Action Coding System which can identify a person's emotions. The question is whether this technology is actually valuable and for what it could be used for. Experts suggest this technology could be used in a classroom to identify the state of mind of a student to adjust the lesson they are trying to comprehend. But, even though this technology may be helpful to teachers trying to keep students active and engrossed in their lessons, the question arises of whether this techonlogy is actually worth the recources or whether what experts think is a great idea is actually an invasion of privacy.  The article states that the technology associates each emotion with \"characteristic movements of the facial muscles\" and then uses those movements to calculate the spectrum of emotions based on their facial display. But some people show emotions in various ways, and the technology most likely cannot accomodate for the many different ways people express the same emotion. For example, if a student has a resting face that seems generally happy, the system might confuse this dazed face as a satisfied face and think that the student is happy with their lessons when they are actually confused or not paying attention. In the same way, if a student has a resting face that looks naturally sad, the system may think they are unhappy with their lessons, even if the student feels they are learning a lot. A lot of students also try to hide their emotions, like frusteration or sadness, with a happier look on their face, and even though the article states that the system can detect a \"false smile\", it cannot always be accurate as a person may be good at hiding their emotions and displaying a genuine smile. Therefore, since technology is not always accurate and because human beings are so various in the way they behave, the technology would not be useful in a classroom where it may misread a student's state of mind and lead them in the wrong path of education.  The age of computers is inescapable, but it doesn't have to be. Instead of computer analyzed emotional connection, people should put their phones down and ask each other how they are. Not every person wants their emotions analyzed, especially in schools. Students bonds with teachers are simply student to teacher; a child must trust an adult before they talk about their feelings. Computer facial technology might be helpful, but not in schools. This technology falls flat in the category of connection. Don't take the easy way out, instead of analyzing emotions with a computer, ask someone how they are. If a student looks upset, sit down and talk with them. Show someone they are valuable and deserve one on one human interaction  The implications of technology that can detect emotions simply by reading the muscles in the face sound truly remarkable. The thought that one can tell what another is thinking simply by plugging data or maybe even a picture into an algorithm sounds like fiction, but may soon be a reality. The article, \"Making Mona Lisa Smile\" by Nick D'Alto briefly discusses the possible use of such technology in a classroom. The system could examine student's faces, and if they read to be unengaged or uninterested, could adjust the lesson to make learning more interesting to that group of students. That type of technology could revolutionize learning, and customly tailor lesson plans to the feelings of students on any given day.  The human body has way more than just six emotions so getting a high accuracy reading on how you are really feeling is out of the question because FACS uses the a process of a 3-D model Dr. Huang states \"The process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D model of the face; all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles.\" This quote explains that it has to use a way of making a model which can sometimes take some time depending on the processing power of the computer not only that but human emotions can change quite quickly and if the pc doesnt make the model fast enough the computer can easly fail at getting and accuarate reading.  Computers don't have emotions, but you do! Imagine technology that seriously works for you, not only at home but also in the classroom! If technology could accurately read human facial expressions the learning possibilities could be endless. For example, think about that one story that you're forced to read that you just can't understand and brings out all your frustrations, with facial expression recognition you probably will never be so frustated again.  As stated in by Nick D'Alto, most human communication is not verbal. Meaning that people express their emotions by their looks or their actions, but they chose when to do this. The Facial Action Coding System takes away this freedom from students, they do not have the choice when to express what they are feeling if anyone can just use a face scanning system on them. \" Imagine being able to detect exaclty how other people are feeling, even when they are trying to hide their emotions (D'Alto 1),\" this first sentence perfectly shows how it takes away peoples freedom of when they want to express certian emotions tocertian people.  Every living thing on planet earth has emotions. These emotions have been used since the beginning of time to express the feelings of the people around you. However, these emotions can be decieving. Someone could say they are happy, when really they are angry or upset. This is where the Facial Action Coding System comes into play. The FACS is a software that detects human emotion by tracking muscles in the face. For example, when you are happy, muscles in your face move up, and when you are sad, they move down, FACS tracks this and calculates your emotions. The creators of this software, Prof. Thomas Huang and Prof. Nicu Sebe are the leading experts of developing better ways for humans and computers to communicate. There are still some questions surrounding the usefulness of FACS, like what could this software actually be used for? One of the ways FACS may be used is in classrooms.  Emotion is in the brain, not the heart. The way the FACS understands emoion is simple. It maps out a 3-D model of the face, looks at the shape and positoin of all the muscles, then it associates the different facial movements with differet emotion. For example, your orbicularis oris (muscles around your mouth) tighten your lips to show when you are angry. It even works when a person it trying to mask emotions. During a fake smile, the zygomatic major stretches the mouth sidways, while in a real smile the zygomatic major lifts the corners of the mouth. These examples can show how science IS able to understand emotoin, probaly better than most humans. Arguments that use that falshood, that science is unable to understand emotion, is completly false.  Nick D' Alto says \"Imagine a computer that knows when you're happy or sad.\" The author of this article talks of how it will improve ad placements by whether you smile or frown, however I know for a fact social medias, especially Facebook, are already basing information on preferable ads by just what material you look at. Why is it necessary for a program to constantly scan our face just to see if we like something or not? This gives the computer so much power of constantly knowing what your exact emotions are on everything. It is just so unnecessary that it causes one to question why in the world would we risk giving computers that kind of power. Also, is it appropiate to constantly scan childrens' faces as they are trying to learn? Would there be a security system in place or parental agreement necessary that would allow the permission of constant invasion of privacy in the name of education? There are many ethical questions and unknown future outlooks that one would not want to subject children to that sort of test of safety and security. ",

The fact that they feel their vote has no effect, they pay less attention to the campaign than they would have if the president were picked by popular vote.  The subject of the Electoral Coolege's method of selecting a president is controversial in the sense that it may turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state, such as Democrats in Texas, or Republicans in California,when they know their vote will have no effect, their incentive is much less than if it were picked by popular vote  Another argument, according to source 3, paragraph 23, is that the Electoral College method of choosing the president, \"may turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state.  For example the winner takes all system in each state. Candidates don't spend times in the states they know they have no chance winning. \"It can be argued that the Electoral college method of selecting the president may turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state.\" (qoute from source 3).  The popular voting method is directly controlled by the people and their vote is sent directly to their desired candidate. On the other side, by using the electoral college method voters vote for a select member of the state's electoral college votes and that member is\u00a0 elgible to vote for any presidential candidate of their choice. According to the article \"In Defense of the Electoral College: Five Reasons to keep our Despised Method of Choosing the President\" by Richard A. Posner, \" when you vote for a presidential candidate you are actually voting for a slate of electors.\" Further evidence from this article (quote on quote) claims there is a \" lack of democratic pedigree.\" Electoral voting also only benefits the larger states because of there is a\u00a0 larger amount of members of the electoral college for the\u00a0 larger states.  Under the Electoral College, voters do not vote directly for who they want as president, but instead for a slate of electors, who in turn select the president. Although these electors may pledge themselves to a particular candidate, there is no way to determine whether or not they end up casting their vote according to the will of the people who put them in charge. Such an unpredictable turn of events could be avoided if only the outcomes of presidential elections were determined by popular vote, not through an Electoral College.  Electoral College has been around for centuries, but now people feel as if the way presidents are being chose to run our country is unfair. The Electoral College is an unfair way of choosing presidents, by it being known as a winner-take-all system. Stated in the passage, \"Candidates don't spend time in the states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the swing states.\" The candidates in the \"lame\" states did not even see a single campaign ad. The swing states have a higher chance and more likely to see their campaign ads, because they are the more popular states. The more popular states are \"the most thoughtful votes, and should be the ones to decided the election.\" Swing states get campaign ads, they are the ones who are being favored, while there are other states just trying to get a campaign sign, and get their votes recognized.  In conclusion, the popular voting method should be applied as the designated process of electing the United States President because it guarantees a direct vote towards a desired candidate of your choice. As our country is listed as a democracy, the votes towards the President should lie in the hands of the people. The electoral college is prone to many more problems and is a more complex method of voting. With votes in the hands of the people, voters can get a full \" hands on\" voting experience. As to not repeat myself, in this way voters can really understand the voting system and get the idea in their head their vote is going towards their chosen candidate. Popular voting has not only been proven to be the more preferred method of voting, but in my opinion, shall be the established method of voting to use in the future elections.    According to source one, \"What Is The Electoral College?\", each political party has it's own set of electors that equal the amount of congressional delegates per state. Usually each state has a \"winner-take-all\" method, so the presidential candidate that gets majority in your state will get all of the electors that represent their party, not just most of them. This is beneficicial to the outcome of the election becuase it makes the ability for a candiate to get majority vote much simpler. There is less of a possibility of a tie, or an outcome where no candidate wins. Source 3, \"In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep out despised method of choosing president\", states that \"even a very slight plurality in a state creates a landslide electoral-vote victory in that state...\" , therefore allowing the candidate to secure all votes to their side, instead of having the votes divided on the line of majority rule, and causing rifts between Electoral College voters.   The Electoral College also aviods the problem of election in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast. Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992 are good examples, they both only a had 43 percent plurality of the popular votes. Some potential voters who have no hope have less in centive to pay attention to the campaign than they would have if the president were picked by popular votes. ",

It is even more obvious that it is a landform because ones just like it exist on Earth! Even though it would've been very interesting for it to have been actually created by aliens, it was just a natural landform in the end.  So in conclusion it is not a alien made face it simply in a mesa or a landmark on Mars. The proof is in the article when you see the 3 picutes that were taken to prove it wasn't a alien made artifact. No matter how cool it would be if it was not to mention that it could make NASA famous or rich it just doesn't have the proof you need to be a alien artifact. If you look more into the passage it even says it was not a alien made artiffact. Yes this face was very famous it even says \"The \"Face\" on Mars has since been a pop icon. It has starred in a Hollywood film, apperered in books, magazines, and even radio shows.\" (5). See how famous that face was 25 years ago is amazing but it still doesn't mean it was a alien made artiffact. So in final say it is not a alien made face and nor will there be enough proof its just a landmark on Mars that was very popular to people everywhere!            I find it highly unrealistic that NASA would even have been able to determine what the Face was forty years ago, much less hiding a discovery of extra-terrestrial life that could make a huge profit for the space program. And, had NASA really claimed that the Face was an object built by otherworldly life, surely someone would let the cat out of the bag. Not to mention that, if the vast majority of NASA believed it was an alien monument, do you really think that they would wait eighteen years to investigate the subject again? On top of all of this, it's simply illogical that aliens would create such a thing. As far as we all know, the supposed \"aliens\" on Mars have never come in contact with a human, much less seen one. That only leaves possible explanation; aliens created a monument that of which coincedentally resembles a human head. An absolute coincedence.  Even if the cameras used to take these pictures weren't of the highest quality, said cameras would have been able to at least catch some photos of further signs of life. Things such as houses or buildings, for example. Now, if some one would like to argue that the aliens lived in caves or other natural formations of the sort, how would those people like to argue the fact that there are no visible creatures in any photos? Do they expect people to believe that every living thing on Mars decided to hide from a satelite they would not even be able to see from the surface?  In conclusion, some people may think there is alien life on Mars because of past picture or conspiracy theories. No one can denty however, that NASA has proven the Face to be nothing but a natural landform on the Red Planet Mars. NASA has proven this by recent pictures, scientific evidence, and real-life examples and measurements. Over the years, NASA has worked hard to figure out the mystery of the face, and just recently they have discovered, with pictyures, evidence, and measruements, that the Face is just a natural landform with unusual shadowing formed on the Red Planet Mars.  So, while some conspiracy theorists would like to think that aliens created this well-known face on Mars, they are incorrect. The face on Mars is just a natural landform that was wrongly perceived by the public. By advancing in digital technology, understanding the effect of shadows, and realizing that there is no evidence to support aliens on Mars, it can be concluded that the face on Mars is just another peculiar natural landform.

                "content": "For example, look at this study that the Social Interaction and Communication Association took at a local middle school. When Students were pushed, or put out of their comfort zone to more things with others, they talked around 30% more than they use to, and had 45% easier time making friends with others. This shows that pushing these kids to talk to others more, or easing them out of their comfort zone, can really help them find people they can depend on. Showing that doing something like this can really be good for them. There isn't just that, there is also more evidence that proves this point! Generic_Name, A Counselor at Generic_School, Had this to say about pushing kids to do activities to meet new people \"There is usually a reason kids can be like this, it's because they haven't found the group of people that understand them, when pushed though, they can find those people, and feel like they belong,\". This shows that, from what Generic_Name observed, the students can find their people if they have someone help them try something new, and that they just need that little push to find them.  Kids need to be connected and be able to interact with each other. It is simply part of being a growing person. We need that constant interaction to settle our nerves and keep us up on our friends lives. Obviously the class room is not the appropriate place or time for that. However, kids texting and talking in their own free time is completely acceptable. Connection is important to kids. Take it away and all is lost for us all.  Bullying would be reduced for students since they're not forced to sit next to or even see a rude kid every day. Kids could only hang out and surround themselves with who they want to be around and don't have random seats or random partners and table mates. Having students not go into a classroom and all come together would also stop the spread of diseases and colds. Several schools have began online learning since the corona outbreak started to try and reduce the spread of that highly infectious disease. Another big social benefit, would be that kids can't be disruptive during classes and talk when the teacher is talking or talking to other kids and disrupt their learning envierment.\u00a0Online learning would fix many have the social problems we have at school today.  In the real world, future adults will have contact with a lot of people and students who had an interaction with other students will have an easier time doing so in their adult life. Unlike kids who spent their time in a room all by themselves learning, they will have to adapt to having interactions with other people. For example if a student who took the online classes in a future job had to present something for his boss, the student would have a difficult time getting his point across to other people because of the missing interaction with other people during their developmental years. Now if a student who attended school with other people did this it would be much easier for them because they would know how to talk to others and get their point across.  but forcing kids to branch out and do extracurricular activities will bring them out of their shell and mold them into a better person.  However, in high school, it is better to give students more freedom because in their careers they will not always have someone telling them what to do every step of the way and they will have to think for themselves  Students make life long friends from school: college roommates, kindergarten\u00a0best friend, or high school\u00a0sweethearts. Taking away the random dice roll of interactions by lowering the rate at which kids interact would create students with minimal social lives and students more likely to become sad or depressed. Students taking classes from home would loose touch with societal standards and become worse adults by not respecting things like: dress codes, rules of the office, or authority figures. This would be because of the lowered interaction with these rules and could lead to people who aren't mentally tough. Students without friends would become lost in society and could be unable to speak about their situation because of their lack of original social interaction.   On the other side of the fence there are some people that believe that they are very studious and would never have a problem like this.  In a student's home they have access to toys and electronics such as phones, televisions, and computers that can take their attention away from learning. However if students took classes in a school building they would not have access to as many of these distracting things, and they would also have a teacher that would be able to take any distractions they find away from them. Another way that distance learning would allow students to become easily distracted is because their is no other students around to keep them on task. By taking their classes inside of a school building students would be surrounded by other students who are also doing work. Being surrounded by other students who are also doing their work will help motivate students to continue to focus on their own assignments. Personally, I prefer to do my homework at school, in my study hall period, as opposed to completing it at home. I would rather do my work at school because I am surrounded by other students that motivate me to finish my work, and also their is less distractions around me. One specific example of how doing my work in school benefits me is when I had to complete my history project on Andrew Jackson. Instead of working on my project during my study hall period, I decided to take a nap and told myself that I would be able to finish the project at home. However, when I got home, instead of working on my project, I was immediately distracted by the television and ended up watching a six episodes of one television show instead of finishing my project. When I received my grade back on the project I saw that I had received a C+ instead of my usual A. If I would have completed my project in study hall I would have been more focused on doing the project, due to the other students also working on assignments around me, and I would have received a better grade.   What is truly important about getting up in the morning and going to a gigantic building filled with hundreds of people is that it is filled with family, friends, neighbors, and even strangers. Meeting all of these people and learning new things about them can really strengthen the school-wide community connections. Advancements with technology also help us by letting students connect with other people in their community, but technology also doesnt help us if we are letting students attend classes online through video conferences. Doing so would cause a major lack of enthusiasm and relationships within a community. Going home independently and working on classwork without getting the chance to learn about your teacher or other classmates through this safe environment at school, causes a total downfall on community awareness.

                "content": "Contrary to popular belief, there is nothing unatural about the supposed \"Face on Mars\". Though many would like to believe in the supernatural, this oddity is nothing but a rock formation. There are several reasons as to why the theory of aliens making this formation is preposterous, each reason stronger than the previous.  So, while some conspiracy theorists would like to think that aliens created this well-known face on Mars, they are incorrect. The face on Mars is just a natural landform that was wrongly perceived by the public. By advancing in digital technology, understanding the effect of shadows, and realizing that there is no evidence to support aliens on Mars, it can be concluded that the face on Mars is just another peculiar natural landform.  So in conclusion it is not a alien made face it simply in a mesa or a landmark on Mars. The proof is in the article when you see the 3 picutes that were taken to prove it wasn't a alien made artifact. No matter how cool it would be if it was not to mention that it could make NASA famous or rich it just doesn't have the proof you need to be a alien artifact. If you look more into the passage it even says it was not a alien made artiffact. Yes this face was very famous it even says \"The \"Face\" on Mars has since been a pop icon. It has starred in a Hollywood film, apperered in books, magazines, and even radio shows.\" (5). See how famous that face was 25 years ago is amazing but it still doesn't mean it was a alien made artiffact. So in final say it is not a alien made face and nor will there be enough proof its just a landmark on Mars that was very popular to people everywhere!            In 1976, Viking 1 took photos of Mars and found a huge rock formation that remebled a human head with shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth.  This was soon to be known as the \"Face on Mars\".   The face has been a pop icon ever since the discovery of the formation. the face will always be a piece of history and will always been known to man. If there was an actual face on Mars then that would be a sign of life. The face ended up eing a mesa and nothing else besides that. Although it would have been an exciting discovery for NASA, we still have much more of space that is unknown and unexplored. NASA is bound to find some kind of incredible object. We will have to wait until that day comes and find something incredible and will be part of the incredible true story of space.              Mars has been a planet that we have been exploring for many years. We have discovered many abnormal objects on the planet. In 1976, we took a picture of the region Cydonia, and we found something that seemed to look like a human face. Our eyes are adapted to recognizing faces and that is why we recognized the face on Mars more easily. Higher quality images that were taken in 2001 show that the face on Mars is no sign of ancient civilization on Mars but in fact a mesa.  In 1976 the face looked like a face. In 1998 it started to not look like a face at all. In 2001 it just looked like a rock. So i believe that it was not created by aliens but that it was just something the olanet had made itself. This has certainly got the attention of the people.  The \"Face on Mars\" is not a face. If you look at the pictures from 1976, and 1998, and 2001 and in the text it says that the photo from 2001 is the most recent photo that NASA has. It still looks nothing like a face so since the 2001 picture is the most recent it shows that it is just a natural landform. It is just a natural landform. On Mars there are natural landforms everywhere and the fade away. Here on earth natural landforms are created everyday.  The curiousity about Mars has been going on for centuries.  People say that there is or once was life on Mars, and now they are saying that there is a face on Mars.  Humans all around the world have questioned whether the \"Face\" was created by aliens or just a natural landform.  In recent years many citicens have stated that the so called \"face on mars\" is a martion monument. Well I have but one question for those few citicens. Do you have any proof?  When the face on Mars was originally captured, there was no such thing. The article explains that when the picture was originally captured in 1976, the camera quality was not great. For example the text states, \"Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo.\" So, when given a better camera quality than in 1976, the face on mars no longer looks like a defined face. Although the quality of the camera is a great support, there are many other explanations that put an end to conspiracy theorists. ",

                "content": "In paragraph 7, it says, \"some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface and have lasted for three weeks in such conditions.\" This shows that they are already testing new methods that could possibly survive on Venus. In paragraph 7, it says, \"Another project is looking back to an old technology called mechanical computers...system that use mechanical parts can be made more resistant to pressure, heat, and other forces.\" This proves that they are using all resources that even date back to the 1800s.  Lastly, modern day technology is known for its speed and cinvenience to access information. In paragraph 7, the author discussed how electronics we simplified to last at least three weeks in simulating conditions to Venus. He explained, \"modern computers...tend to be more delicate when it comes to extreme physicakl conditions.\" He supported this claim by informing readers that older technology, mechanical computers, have been re-evaluated and seem to have better calculations but involve levers and such.  While talking about different approaches to studying Venus the author states, \"...simplified electronics...have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface and have lasted for three weeks...\". This quote also helps the reader understand that studying Venus can be done in a safe and harmless way. Using this new technology could help research on Venus advance, and keep those doing the research out of harm's way. The author then goes on to talk about a different technology that was used in World War 2 that can also be used as a new method to study Venus. These are called mechanical computers, and they use gears and levers rather than the electronics that actual computers use. The mechanical computers are made of mechanical parts which are stronger, so they shouldn't be damaged as easily. These are just a few of the ways technology can help safely advance the study of Venus.   The author also states, \"Some simplified electronics... have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface and have lasted for three weeks in such conditions\" (7). The author backs up her idea by using these electronics, that can survive three weeks on venus, to once again show that we can get through to venus. Science and technology being able to help us properly function on Venus shows that the planet is a worthy pursuit. Ultimately, the author backs up her idea by giving evidence on the different ways landing on Venus is possible.  NASA's advancements for Venus exploration are promising, \"For example, some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface and have lasted for three weeks in such chaos,\" (7). Humans would not be able to use the most advanced technology, but durability is the goal, \"By comparison, systems (mechanical computers that use gears and levers to calculate) that use mechanical parts can be made more resistant to pressure, heat, and other forces,\" (7). If humans were to only hover over Venus, the possibilites are limited. Humans and technology have to be as close as possible. Technology that could last for a few weeks is enough to vastly expand our knowledge. Mechanical computers are now obsolete, but in Venus would be a valuable tool, just like the other electonics being made. Researchers have worked tirelessly to continue making Venus exploration a reasonable reality.  Some issues still remain for the exploration, however NASA has already started preparing solutions. The heated state of the planet may be an issue, but NASA is studying a resolution. Paragraph 7 reads, \"For example, some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface and have lasted for three weeks in such conditions\" (The Challenge of Exploring Venus). This new technology created could lead to a long-lasting basis for human life, yet another reason exploring Venus is a brilliant idea. Modern technology is too fragile for the harsh heat of the planet, but with some older computers, that as well could survive on Venus. Paragraph 7 reads, \"The thought of (mechanical) computers existing in those days may sound shocking, but these devices make calculations by using gears and levers and do not require electronics at all. Modern computers are enormously powerful, flexible, and quick, but tend to be more delicate when it comes to extreme physical conditions\" (The Challenge of Exploring Venus). This is yet another piece of technology on Earth and prepared for Venus  They explain that NASA has a theory that sending anything electronic to it will die off within hours, where as sending parts from the 1800's - 1940's won't. I know this becaues in the text it states that, \"NASA is studying other approches to studying Venus. For example, some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface and have lested about three weeks...These devices were first envisiond in the 1800's and played an important role in the 1940's during the war...but, these devices made calculations by using gears and levers without electricity...By comparison, systems that use mechanical pats can be made more resistant to pressure, heat, and other forces\"(paragraph 7). This means that hypothetically NASA could send older tech and find a way to uncover more information.  In the article, the author continously offers alternatives for exploration. He does this is paragraphs' 5,6, and 7 where he gives examples of organizations that are working towards this exploration. However in all of the paragraphs, the author seems to only be giving \"what if\" scenarios or in some cases just simple ideas that have been thought about and are possibly being examined. He fails to provide any real data or statistics for these things, except when he mentions the simplified electronics in paragraph 7. Even then, those devices are only able to survive for 3 weeks, so it would still take many years to just improve those devices. Also, in paragraph 6 the author states, \"Many researchers are working on innovations that would allow our machines to last long enough to contribute meaningfully to our knowledge of Venus\". This statement is very broad, and it does not key in on any form of information that should lead us to believe that to be true. These details from the passage prove my point on the amount of years it would take, as well as the fact that nobody has any idea how long. The question to be asked here is, \"Is it worth the wait?\". For these reaons I stand behind my claim that the author supported the idea of exploring venus very poorly.   Although the author describes how Venus could be studied from the air, scientists still desire to learn about Venus from the planet's surface. One of their solutions to the problem of getting equipment to last on the surface of Venus is to expirement with new materials. \"Simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the choas of Venus's surface and have lasted of three weeks in such conditions\" (7). Research and experimentation taking place on Earth is giving scientists and astronauts more options for studying Venus. Although conditions on Venus are not hospitable to life, these new scientific advances are making it possible for data-gathering equipment to be sent to the surface of Venus and last long enough to gather data. Other scientists are moving away from traditional electronics and looking into purely mechanical systems. \"Systems that use mechanical parts can be made more resistant to pressure, heat, and other forces\" (7). The alternative that has presented itself to would-be explorers of Venus is older technology, like that found in the earliest computers. Scientists have realized that modern technology is too fragile and that more durable technologies are needed. By turning to other forms of technology, scientists are widening their options for ways to study Venus. The author mentions three different ways that scientists are making progress towards being able to study Venus - from the air, using new materials, and using old technologies. The author's postion that Venus should continue to be studied is supported by the scientific advancements that are serving to make studying Venus a reality.  When discussing the potential plans to explore the planet, the author states \"Many researches are working on innovations that would allow our machines to last long enough to contribute meaningfully to our knowledge of Venus.\" This quote makes it clear to the audience that scientists are doing whatever it takes to develop multiple, efficient plans for space travel. The author also goes onto provide different examples to further convey how close scientists are to developing the safest plan possible. They specifically mention the use of simplified electronics made of silicon carbide and explain how they've already been tested in a chamber that simulate the conditions of Venus's surfaces, yet how they're still being improved upon. They also describe an old technology called mechanical computer, noting how this technology has already been used frequently in the 1940's and how it can be incorporated into space travel now. The author has given detailed descriptions of the efforts made and the options available to provide a safe embarkment for humans to support the ideas that Venus is a worthy pursit. ",

Doing an extracurricular gives kids a chance to branch out in their community, and make great friends along the way, that'll possibly stick beside them for a lifetime. Then, since an activity gives students a chance to branch out, they could learn very important life skills.  Despite a student not having a hobby that is provided through an extracurricular activity, by joining a club they may discover a new passion. For example, the Fiber Arts club I had joined also included knitting and felting activities. While at first I was only focused on doing what I was comfortable with, I soon got interested in the other activities that were available. Through this, I discovered new hobbies I still enjoy to this day which other students may also experience.  I think you should join the sea cowboy program because it would be a learning experience for all. The sea cowboy programis a life changing expirence that i think you would enjoy!  If a student has had a passion ever since they were a little kid and know that they would like to join a club that builds on that, this policy would help do that. For example, if a student knew they wanted to be part of a club that helps them build on an interest of computer science they would be given the chance to join a club such as the Robotics team. They would be able to use their previous knowledge and joy for their topic, to elevate the team to greater success. If the school was able to bring a high number of dedicated students together to join clubs they would see vast improvements in the success of their activities. These students would be given even more motivation to join the club they love, bringing the best out of them and allow them to join clubs that they know they have interest in. Even though there are some students that know exactly what they want to do and want to dedicate all their time to one club, some students are not like that. Many students would like to explore various clubs and see which one is best for them, creating another reason to enact this policy.  If you ask someone for advice, they may be able to take something they learned from a choice they had to make. You can apply that to the decision that you need to make. When I was in fifth grade, I was in my last year of Cub Scouts and I was getting ready to cross over into Boy Scouts. I had to choose what Boy Scout troop I wanted to cross over to. I couldn't decide on which one I wanted to go to, so I asked my great uncle, who was a very successful scout, how he decided which troop he wanted to join. He told me to \"find a group of scouts that I would enjoy sharing a meal or a tent with, because if you have that, your time in scouting will be much more enjoyable.\" That advice led me to Generic_Name, they were all really nice people, so I ended up joining their troop. Four years later I'm still enjoying Boy Scouts, I've gone on dozens of camping trips, and made some of my best friends. Asking my great uncle for advice was really helpful in that situation.  Volunteering in community service looks really good on a record, and usually when you apply for a job there is a section that ask for volunteer work, so it could also help some kids get better jobs.  Students have their interests, they either like something, or they don't. Something might not come off as interesting to them at first glance. They might only start to realize something is interesting to them when they take another look. If schools do an event that shows off each different club, students will get that \"second glance\" that they need. For example, my older brother wanted to join a club in high school. He looked through the website and found that nothing sounded interesting to him. He decided to look again, this time actually reading the descriptions of each club. He eventually found the art club. He read the description, thought it sounded interesting and signed up.  If its about what you want to wear today and you ask someone they have given you their viewpoint and their constructive critisim about it. If you are asking people to give you advice about what type of people you should be around with then your getting more viewpoints on the matter. It could even be a viewpoint that saves you from a deathly mistake like if you were thinking about joining the army and you friend says, \"I dont think your ready for the army maybe somethig that could help but less physical like the airforce\". Then you sign up for the air force and in two weeks you hear on a sad gloomy day that the whole troop you were about to join was sent to the dark jungles of vietnam and now was all killed in action. That tiny viewpoint and good advice just saved your life.  When I was a Seagoing Cowboy, it opened up the world to me. I saw that the world wasn't all sunshine and rainbows, like the little me thought. The world was full of unfairness and was my job, everybody's job, to help stop it. I stepped up to do my part by joining the Seagoing Cowboys. Do your part. Join the Seagoing Cowboys program today. Make the world a better place, one cow at a time.  As a shy person, when I first came to my school I was struggling to find some good friends that I could trust. Later on I decided to join a chess club and a drawing club and I made great friends. Joining a extracurricular activity can give shy students a way to to train on socializing, meaning that they could practice how to socialize and even overcome their fear of socializing by talking to people in their extracurricular activity. At school, some students who are not shy can be very loud and disruptive during class. If these students join a extracurricular activity, they will not want to socialize as much during class because they will have a extracurricular activity that they could join and talk and share their opinions there. Extracurricular activities are very helpful towards students who want to make some friends and socialize, so therefore making students participate in at least one is necessary. ",

If they were to hang out more, then they could start to find out that they have a lot more in common. Making new friends at that activity will make the students want to go back to that activity so they can see their friends again. This would go perfectly with the idea that the principal had. The student wants to go to something that the principal is telling them that they have to go to. This gives the principal what they want, and it gives the students what they want.  Socializing and making friends is important for anyone's mental health. Friends can be supporting and a helping hand at any time. The friends you make can also build a strong character in you. If you join an extracurricular activity that you really like, it can be easier to make friends because they will have the same interest as you. Because of the similar interests, the friends you make through an activity can be more closer than the friends you make in class. Making friends gets you to know other people in your school, and it's better to know more people so you can feel more comfortable at school.  Having something in common helps people socialize and discuss that topic. Then, children can make friends over things they both like to do and discuss, plus they'll be able to work together on the topic. If the topic they made friends over was a sport, they can become better friends because teammates have to rely on each other\u00a0during games. Having a sport as an extracurricular activity also gets kids exercising and it's not always a bad thing.  Making friends while on a team or a club will be much easier, the students will have connections with others, and everyone will have something to talk about. Some students may find it hard to make friends, but by being in an extracurricular activity, there are many chances to find a long lasting\u00a0pal.   They will not constantly have to talk to teachers or other classmates about work, or have to work on a project in a group, which can help them tremendously with people skills. They generally will not make friends or see any of their friends because of them being at home while their friends are at school, which can cause anti-socialism. They will not be in class interacting with other teachers and students, which can lead to them not having confidence in talking or not wanting to talk to other people or students.  The Department of Youth Statistics stated that one of the best ways for students to make friends is by letting students choose what activities to do and pairing those with similar interests together. That is exactly what clubs do. Furthermore, it is proven by the University of Psychology that when students have a healthy amount of friends, they are less likely to fail their classes and more likely to succeed. Based on that, extracurricular activities can cause students to be more successful than their peers who do not partake in those activities.   They'll become happier and less stressed out from other things going on, like problems with family or schoolwork, which will have a positive affect on their grades, family life, and social life. This, can lead to even more success in the future. Lastly, they can create lifelong friends, and meet more people which can help them get how used to introducing themselves to other people, and get used to the situation. This is another important skill for the future that is taught by an extracurricular.  If you join any sports or clubs, you are definitely going to meet new people to make your friends, which is a great thing because it gives you people to talk to and get along with so you won't be by yourself in any activities you would do after school.  it will provide them an opportunity to make life-long friends  People, in general, need other people in their lives. Friends can help people find who they truly are on the inside. The easiest way to make friends as a kid is going to a public school. Not only does school help kids get friends, but it also teaches them how to interact with people in the real world. When a student is put through an online course at home, the easiness to make friends and interact with people goes away. In fact, home schooled\u00a0kids have shown a lack of social skills, and are generally more shy than those who go to public school. Many have even developed psychological disorders such as depression, anxiety, and even a slightly warped perception of reality. Students would be much better off going to a public school and learning from there.  ",

                "content": "It's no surprise to anyone that bullying and harrassment goes on, not only in adolescence, but all throughout life for some people. If a child was facing this type of harrassment in school, the ability to take classes from home would eliminate that stressor for them. They wouldn't have to worry about coming into class every day and having to confront their bullies. This would be beneficial for a multitude of reasons, and it can also be a preventative measure to ensure the safety of students as well. Peers have an enormous amount of influence and power over the actions of certain individuals, and being forced to interact with that kind of behavior all the time could potentially pose as a threat. Being taught at home gives students the ability to control who they get to see and when, and for some people, it is absolutely necessary for them to have this option.  Just because they didn't take part in the chess\u00a0club, or the yearbook committee doesn't mean that they should be held back. Someone could be the next Albert Einstein and focus on school so much that he didn't have time for extracurricular activities, but you decide to hold him back because of a silly little thing he didn't do. Whether students do extracurricular activities or not shouldn't determine if they proceed to learn new things. The administrators should look at their grades and their work habits. It does not make a valid reason for them to be robbed of their opportunity to be smarter, if they just didn't participate in an extracurricular activity.  Having a low grade in a subject that we aren't specifically doing well in, shouldn't prevent us from playing a sport that we excel in. We try our best in everything we do and it wouldn't be right to punish us by taking away an activity that we can excel in. To most of the students, sports mean everything to them and taking it away because of one bad grade will make them feel like their best didn't work so why should I keep trying. It defeats their self-confidence and willpower. This will make them slack off in class and therefore, decrease their knowledge.  We as humans can not let fear stand in our way and give up on our evolutionary duty because we are afraid that someone else will hurt us for it.  If you let a student's grade decide if a student can or can't compete in sports, you can be holding them back from healthy exercise and keep them from building confidence. Exercise keeps students healthy and when a student competes in sports, they are exercising. Every gym teacher I've ever had has always told us how daily exercise is important and I've seen many commercials that say growing kids and teens need at least one hour of exercise each day to keep physically fit and healthy. Sports also build confidence. When a team wins, it boosts a person's confidence. When you are confident, you feel that you can do anything and succeed. Sports provide healthy exercise and confidence to students, but if you keep this rule, you'll be depriving it from us.  If you are talking to family member they may not care about your problems or say something along the lines of \"oh honey it's ok you will be fine\" and them saying that is not fine and you should never be satisfied with that answer from anyone. Your friend or close peer, like a teacher or coach will want to understand your issue and they want to help you at all costs because they know that your a good kid and they never want to see you down,moody or upset ever. Your coaches put you through struggle and so do you teachers so they know you can handle the hard moments in life and want to always help you, so you can make the right decision. whenever you hear a question in class you want to seek understanding about the question so you can answer it the next time someone asks. The issue hear is very similar to that and when you have a problem or issue that you believe needs a second opinion they will always be willing to listen. That way they can ultimately impact your decision for the better and you will be so relieved and you will ask yourself why you didn't go to them earlier  by listening to just one person, you may only get that one person's opinion about what he or she believes is right. It is important to listen to what many others have to say in order to make the best decision for yourself. Recently, I got a bad grade on a math test. My grade hadn't gone below a 98% in Algebra so far. This test brought me down a whole letter grade. I didn't know if I should retake it or not. I knew it probably wouldn't bring my grade up much. However, I still didn't know what to do. I asked my Math teacher, my parents, and a few of my friends. Each looked at the situation differently. After listening to all of these perspectives, I put them together and formed my own decision. As long as I did my homework and got a good grade on the next test, I would be back up to an A and not have to retake it. I was helped a lot by getting different\u00a0opinions of people with different backgrounds.  \"Don't exclude, you should always include.\" This is what teachers have told my fellow students and I for years. I think it is unfair to not let everyone compete in sports. These students that didn't get A' s or B' s may be the people who always wanted to compete in sports, but never had thought to join or never had the guts to stand up and join the teams, but if you introduce this new rule, then they don't even get a chance to try. I think this new rule is unfair and it shouldn't be kept.  Some students may be very good in a certain thing, such as writing stories, or sculpting, or some other talent that isn't very popular. This then leads to them having nowhere to go, leaving them with something they don't enjoy. If the school doesn't have a club or activity that suits them, then they shouldn't have to participate in one. If they do, it's just extra work that'll bore them. Clubs are supposed to be enjoyable, and help students find others that have the same interests as them, but if participating in a club or activity is mandatory, students may feel left out, and not included. They may be excluded and picked on for having a talent that others can't relate to,or be picked on for not being good at something.  Many students would say that they would never do such a thing, that they must honor their integrity, but they're lying. Teenagers are impulsive, and if there is an easy road out, we are going to take it, simple as that. For example, if a teacher gives an assignment and they say the answer key is on schoology to check our work, we're going to maybe attempt it. When we don't succeed, guess where we're going: Schoology. I'm saying that I don't trust teenagers to be able to honestly do every single assignment on their own especially if there are no eyes watching. Another example of this would be in a scenario of this said online school. Imagine that there's a big test due on the 18th in math that you haven't studied for. Today is the 17th. Everyone else has done the test and taken pictures of it in case their computers shut down, while others had malicious intent. You haven't studied at all. Your failure is imminent as you already have a C in the class and you need a C to graduate. Your heart is thumping, you don't want to seem a failure to your parents. So what do you do? Ask the teacher for an extension? No, he's too strict and he's going to say no. So you think your only option is to cheat. So you text a student who took picures for the wrong reason. You get the answers you so desperately wanted. But at what cost? You take the test and get a 70. You nearly failed, but you didn't. You find out a few days later that several students have asked for an extension and received one. That is the mindset a lot of students go through when they cheat on a test or assignment. ",

                "content": "The human body has way more than just six emotions so getting a high accuracy reading on how you are really feeling is out of the question because FACS uses the a process of a 3-D model Dr. Huang states \"The process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D model of the face; all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles.\" This quote explains that it has to use a way of making a model which can sometimes take some time depending on the processing power of the computer not only that but human emotions can change quite quickly and if the pc doesnt make the model fast enough the computer can easly fail at getting and accuarate reading.  If they try to take a step in your shoes, and feel how your feeling about the situation then they can process and understand exactly whats happening and what they have to say about it. For example, if you are really sad about something and you talk to your friends about it, it allows them to feel empathy, and try to understand why you are sad, and what they can do to help you. Them seeing things through your point of view allowed them to feel what you are feeling which is why its easy and beneficial to get advice from multiple people. Especially people you trust.  Without needing to have face- to- face human interactions to see how people are feeling, it could result in a decline of being able to recognize emotions in facial expressions.  I learned a few chords on the ukulele this summer. I could piece together a song or two. Now after a few months, I can't remember the first thing about playing those chords. This example shows that if you learn something then don't do it for an extended period of time, it will take a while to relearn how to do it. Although reading emotions is nothing like playing ukulele, the same holds true; if you learn something, and rely on something else to help you do it, it is going to be hard for you to re-learn how to do it again.  When you just ask one person for their opinion on your situation, they might agree with you. But, you know what happens when you just ask one person and they agree with you; you go with your \"gut feeling\" and if you do that then there was no point in asking for an opinion in the first place. However, if you ask multiple people for their opinions then you get many different perspectives, so you can see the situation through the eyes of the person you're fighting with, or running a business with, or having a baby with, etc. That way you can make the better choice because you can now see from the other person's view and understand why they are arguing against you.  If a student is feeling sad or feeling stressed about home problems which they are trying to conceal, then the technology detects this and displays it for the teacher and the electronic lesson to see. This is an invasion of privacy, as the teacher does not need to know about a student's homelife or about their feelings outside the classroom. A teachers job should be to monitor how their students are feeling about their lessons, not about how their students are feeling about their life outside of school, and since this technology could pick up on digressing feelings, it should not be used in a classroom where a student's internal feelings are revealed to a teacher. Therefore, using Facial Action Coding could end up being an invasion of privacy that should not be introduced to the classroom.  As stated in by Nick D'Alto, most human communication is not verbal. Meaning that people express their emotions by their looks or their actions, but they chose when to do this. The Facial Action Coding System takes away this freedom from students, they do not have the choice when to express what they are feeling if anyone can just use a face scanning system on them. \" Imagine being able to detect exaclty how other people are feeling, even when they are trying to hide their emotions (D'Alto 1),\" this first sentence perfectly shows how it takes away peoples freedom of when they want to express certian emotions tocertian people.  For example, everyone knows that feeling of coming home after a long day of work or school. That imaginary switch that immediately turns on in ones brain once they finally step into their home, telling them they can now relax, take off their shoes and do what they want at their own desired pace. Now, imagine if people of all ages, still attending school today could feel completely at ease even while they learn in class, but this time through video conferences.  Humans can often acknowledge how they are feeling, but the acknowledgement itself does not allow them to feel better. As stated in the article, \"They even indicate the difference between a genuine smile and a forced one\" (D'Alto 7). This line states that the lab partner will be able to tell a difference netween a genuine and meaningful smile from a harshly forced smile. There is a difference between the two because smiling will not make you happy although it is a happy gesture. The machine informing someone that they need to smile will not actually change the emotions of that person. Politicians and celebrities are major culprits of this action. They often smile as they are told to do, but they are not always genuine. They are typically hiding something from their spectators such as when they are not being truthful (D'Alto 8). Just because famous people smile when talking or looking at their audience does not change whether or not they are happy individuals. If humans themselves are unable to change their emotions when they can detect that something is wrong, then machines will be unable to do that also. Although it can give people a precise measurement of their emotions, it will not change how they feel. Therefore, investing in this system would be extremely useless and wasteful.  Going out of your comfort zone can really help you feel better about yourself, and not just keeping to yourself. Some Evidence for this is that, in a study taken by the Social Interaction and Communication Association, 60% of students that keep to themselves have lower than average self esteem. This would make sense seeing how if they always keep to themselves, they don't really have anyone to comfort them in their darker times, which this rule could help prevent. More Evidence that highlights this point is when Zachary Andrews, A College student from Colombia, had this to say, \"I honestly never really talked to that many people when I was younger, I didn't really like myself, and didn't think I deserved friends, but when my parents made me join the basketball team, I met and found people that I got along with really well,\". This would show that their is still hope for people that have low self esteem, that just have to have help taking the big step.  The FACS will pick up emotions that a student is feeling and teachers, parents, and or consoulers will be able to get the help that that particular student aqquires. \"To an expert, faces don't lie; these muscle clues are sometimes used to spot when a \"smiling\" politicain or celebrity isn't being truthful.\" This same concept can work with students too. If a student is giving off a false emotion than that student really feels; the FACS can determine the actual emotion the student is feeling. If teachers and parents realize the actual feelings and emotions someone feels, he or she will be able to provide more comfort in the act of helping towards that individual. ",

                "content": "In conclusion the reasons for exploring Venus include how close it is to the sun, how similar it is to Earth, and how it could have supported life forms long ago. Yes, it is very dangerest because of high temperature and pressure. But if we come up with a way to lower the temperature and pressure it will be surely worth the work put in. These reason are way we should try to visit Venus in the future.  The author of this article supports the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers by stating the insight to be gained from further exploring Venus and by presenting new methods that are making new insights possible. The danger of Venus is extensive due to the high temperatures, extreme atmospheric pressure, and wild weather patterns. These obstacles are being dealt with though by new ideas from scientists at NASA. One big idea from NASA is the idea to use a blimp to observe Venus from above the surface. Another idea of theirs is to use materials that would be able to withstand the extreme conditions of the Venusian environment. All this is in the hopes that futher insight will be made on the planet that once was the most Earth-like planet in the solar system.  In \" The Challenge of Exploring Venus\", the author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit because Venus is interesting, helpful, and it is safe  Studying Venus seems almost impossible with all the risks, but the author of \"The Challenge of Exploring Venus\" suggests that Venus is a worthy pursuit despite all the dangers it presents.  The author states, \"NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray.\". Stating ways that Venus can be studied with people not being put in danger helps get the authors point across. The article also touches on how floating above the surface could keep those studying the planet safe. Temperatures would still be high, but nothing the spacecraft couldn't handle, the air pressure would be like how it is on Earth at sea level, soloar power would be bountiful, and radiation would be no higher than the levels on Earth. The text then states, \"Not easy conditions, but survivable for humans.\". Although this would not be an easy job, it is possible to study Venus safely. The details used in this paragraph help convey the authors point that studying Venus can be done safely and that it should continue to happen.  Ultimatley, it is understandable why one would believe that it isn't smart to look into studying and experimenting with Venus; however, the examples of the researched facts and past experiences help to support the authors idea that despite the dangers, Venus is worthy of studying. There may be many dangers that come along with studying different planets, but based off the evidence the author provided, Venus has avoidable ways to make it safe to study.  The idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers is supported through Venus' vast similarites to Earth, which is why humans have such interest in this particular planet.  Venus is one of the most challenging planets to examine due to its very extreme environment  In summary, we should continue studying the planet Venus despite the dangers because if anything were to happen to our planet, Earth, Venus would be the closest planet we could go to, we could learn more about Venus and the planet's harsh conditions, and because Venus is most like Earth and had the ability to support life. Furthering our research on Venus can only benefit us, so lets stop worrying about the dangers and get out and explore our planetary neighbor.  In conclusion, the author's opinon that Venus should continue to be studied despite the dangers is well supported by the rewards of studying another Earth-like planet and the advancements that have been made towards being able to effectively study Venus. Scientists have strong motivation for studying Venus, and new technologies are making it possible for them to overcome the challenges presented by Venus's harsh terrain. Although scientists studying Venus are unlikely to encounter any life forms, what they do discover will help them to understand Earth's past and shape our future. ",

                "content": "For example,\" a classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,\" Dr. huang predicts. \" Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instrucuture.\" This is really helpful to some students because when taking an online lesson some of them might be comfused and the teacher is no there to help. So the computer can take these facial expresions and modify the lesson so you could undestand it better. This also follows along if a student needs help with the lesson, the computer could see you are having a hard time and t to help you by changing the lesson  As stated in by Nick D'Alto, most human communication is not verbal. Meaning that people express their emotions by their looks or their actions, but they chose when to do this. The Facial Action Coding System takes away this freedom from students, they do not have the choice when to express what they are feeling if anyone can just use a face scanning system on them. \" Imagine being able to detect exaclty how other people are feeling, even when they are trying to hide their emotions (D'Alto 1),\" this first sentence perfectly shows how it takes away peoples freedom of when they want to express certian emotions tocertian people.  Based on the evidence given in the article, the use of Facial Action Coding Stystems in the classroom would be wildly valuable. The computer can detect many levels of emotion to accomodate their program to the students' needs. If a particular lesson bores a student or that student has lack of focus, the computer can adjust and change many aspects of thier layout to catch the student's attention. Also, students can receive the correct level of work- whether that be too easy or too hard. And not only can students benefit, but teachers, as well. They can track student progress to further accomodate their needs. While technology can be used for many unethical things, the Facial Action Coding System would be extremely effective in a school setting.      Your actions are never really forgotten. They can be forgiven, or almost forgotten, but they will always be tucked in your mind or somebody else's mind. Sometimes people aren't very cautious about what they say or do, and they don't think about how others might get affected by their actions. Asking multiple people for advice is greatly rewarding because it gives you a sense of many opinions and feelings on a certain subject. Having good and varying advice can help stop you from doing something you might regret later on. Instead of jumping to conclusions and caving in to your impulse, you should ask as many people as you can for advice. That way, you can have time to think about what to do in a bad situation.  The implications of technology that can detect emotions simply by reading the muscles in the face sound truly remarkable. The thought that one can tell what another is thinking simply by plugging data or maybe even a picture into an algorithm sounds like fiction, but may soon be a reality. The article, \"Making Mona Lisa Smile\" by Nick D'Alto briefly discusses the possible use of such technology in a classroom. The system could examine student's faces, and if they read to be unengaged or uninterested, could adjust the lesson to make learning more interesting to that group of students. That type of technology could revolutionize learning, and customly tailor lesson plans to the feelings of students on any given day.  For example, everyone knows that feeling of coming home after a long day of work or school. That imaginary switch that immediately turns on in ones brain once they finally step into their home, telling them they can now relax, take off their shoes and do what they want at their own desired pace. Now, imagine if people of all ages, still attending school today could feel completely at ease even while they learn in class, but this time through video conferences.  Emotion is in the brain, not the heart. The way the FACS understands emoion is simple. It maps out a 3-D model of the face, looks at the shape and positoin of all the muscles, then it associates the different facial movements with differet emotion. For example, your orbicularis oris (muscles around your mouth) tighten your lips to show when you are angry. It even works when a person it trying to mask emotions. During a fake smile, the zygomatic major stretches the mouth sidways, while in a real smile the zygomatic major lifts the corners of the mouth. These examples can show how science IS able to understand emotoin, probaly better than most humans. Arguments that use that falshood, that science is unable to understand emotion, is completly false.  They may lie about not doing their homework or be untruthful about whether they were involved in a fight. The FACS machine could solve that issue as it is able to determine whether someone is lying or not based on their expression which is stated in the quote,\" To an expert, faces don't lie; these muscle clues are sometimes used to spot when a \"smiling\" politician or celebrity isn't being truthful.\" This machine is able to examine the details of one's face to find out if they are lying or not. It examines the key traits of each specific emotion and if they are not meant, that is how it knows whther the truth has been told or not. Students will no longer bee able to weasel their way out of punishment due to their superior lying skills as the FACS machine is able to see through the lies. This is not the only thing this machine can do though for schools.  It is no secret that many students dread coming to school, whether it be from stress, bullying, or simply not understanding the subjects. This system can pick up on a fake emotion, the author explains how it can read a \"fake smile\" and that to them \"faces don't lie\" (para. 8). If this system is able to sense when a student is unhappy or angry, this could be used as an advantage in helping the student. Not only this, but the author explains that \"moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions, but may even help produce them\" (para. 9). Taking both of these statements into account, and allowing them to be incorporated into the classroom, students may enjoy attending school and learning new things.  In the third passage of the artice, the author states, \"Eckman has classified six basic emotions-happiness ... and then associated each with charactersitic movements of the facial muscles,\" meaning that the software associated voluntary or involuntary movements of the face with emotions. The problem with this system is that students can change the look of their face quite easily, and can thus convince the computer to produce desired results, making the system disfunctional. There are quite a few reasons children, especially young ones, would want to make the software not work, including tricking the computer into moving from the original learning program into a more desired one and them simply wanting to see the program fail through their abilities.

                "content": "Sports and activities are a passion for people that runs through their veins like nobody's business. So, what would be the benefit of the school taking that away? Nothing. Children get involved in activities because they love it and they would rather do nothing else. If we strip them from that then what else do they have to cause them to be ambitious in life? It's hard to tell but we know they wont have a passion.  People are becoming homeless, going days without eating, nearly starving, wearing the same clothes everyday and they cant do nothing about it because there are no jobs that they can take. People are being laid-off from their jobs which are leading to those events. If we have community service we will be able to make sure they don't go to bed with their bellies empty, we could make sure that they have a roof over their heads at night, and give them clean clothes to keep. This can really touch peoples hearts and if you were in the same position you would want somebody to do the same thing.  Your on a trip to california from indiana and your afraid to fly so you drive with the new driverless car. You get bored because you dont have to do anything,and your getting tired. So you fall asleep in the car; up ahead there is a broken bridge and your car couldnt wake you up and you missed the detour because your car was incapable of doing its job. Fortunatly your car has a sensor to that aplies the brakes when the driver does not wake up and take the wheel.  Not everyone knows how to do it or what to do. If you ask your dad and he knows nothing about it you cant just give up. you have to ask multiple people someone will give an answer. However you cant stop there you need something that works for you and some body who might have more experience in that area of life and give something that works better for you.  think that if you didn't have the students at our school do community service you would be doing them a great injustice. When we are so privileged to have a nice home, clean water, and a meal on the table every night we should at least be able to go out for an our or two and help someone else who isn't as privileged. Its hardly a great burden to get up from the computer or desk you are at, put on a pair of old jeans and a t-shirt, and go out and help. So I ask only one thing of you; please set aside one day, one measly day, to have all of the students in our school wander out into the community and help someone.  You are sitting in your chair. The plastic hurts your legs and back as it curves in an uncomfortable position, ill-adapted to your person. The intolerable buzz of the air conditioning\u00a0that does nothing to cool the over-heated room drones at your ears, making it impossible to focus. The dull, artificial bulbs that in no way compensate for natural sunlight burn away at your eyes, giving you headache after headache. The other kids are yelling and blasting music, talking instead of doing the work you have been told to complete in an unreasonable, almost impossible time. The work you are doing makes no sense to you and you feel incompetent as those around you breeze by effortlessly. You need to ask the teacher about your work but shes busy grading papers, paying no attention to the class you have been forced into. You can not focus on a single word of your assignment, and even if you could understand it, you would not be able to complete it, because that same day youve already had three tests and two quizzes and all you want is to go home and take a short nap to recharge your brain. You long for some solution to your endless problems in the classroom, and you realize there is another way.  When you might not have classes with a certain friend, it is always a good thing to see them if you have an after school activity with them. The friendship won't fade if you still get to talk to them for even just an hour a day. Sharing what you do after school makes you feel like you are apart of something. I always like sharing my stories about my track meets, practices, and pretty much everything. It's exciting to share stories to your friends instead of saying, \"oh, I don't do anything after school.\" You should be happy about seeing the process you made for the school environment. If you end up in the gardening club or even a Junior Honors Society type club, you help make the front of your schools plants look pretty. People will most likely compliment you daily about how it looks and it'll make you very happy. Don't you want people complimenting your work? Lastly, not being in clubs wont make you happy going to school because you have nothing to look forward too. You could've chose between 100 or more clubs to join, but you didn't so you regret it.  If you ask for help, you might not have so much stress, therefore you might make the decision faster. Making it faster will mean you will have less stress, you wont have to worry about it so much, and you can just move on and enjoy it. When something goes by faster you can just think about the furture and not worry so much on the present. You can make other decisions too, do fun stuff with friends, instead of thinking and worrying about one thing. School might be less stressful because you will not be carring so much weight on your shoulders and you will focus more. Everyone already knows school is so stressful, so making one little thing less stressful can help you focus a lot more. This will make your teachers very proud because they will see you focus more on your work and not be so worked up. You might even do better on test and your grades will be better because you are actually focused instead of worrying about everything.  Its give's you more option's, people who have already been their can be the most helpful, and overall having a second opinion can be more helpful than you know. And having more option's than you need can help you weather it's a big decision or a little one. And having more can help you pick out the one's you dont need and help you find the one's you do need. And you may find out that what someone said really helped you and you may go back to the for more advice and it's just a never ending loop to help you everyday.\u00a0 \u00a0  maybe you don't even know if it is bad advice that is why always get more than one person to get advice from. Now for an example: You just turned twenty and you're still living with your parents so you go to your bad friend house because you think he has cool job probably. So you get to his house then ask him and he says you could join my gang we do cool things and get a lot\u00a0a money you think about talking to your other friend but then you say yes anyway. The next day you go to jail for murder because your friend comited murder to rob a bank. You were sitting in a car waiting\u00a0for your friend to get out of the bank you didn't think that he hurt or robed anyone. Now you in prison for forty years and your friend for life. When you were about to get your good friends advice you didn't but if you did you would realize how bad of an idea that is and would of been fine, so never be to careful. ",

It's just a natural landform by having the shadows covering up most of the landform making it appear as a face. For the conclusion, Cydonia has a natural landform on it that appears itself as a face using the shadows to make the illusion.  The author shows that the huge rock formation, which resembles a human head, is formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and a mouth. The author also states that Garvin said, \"as a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger that the pixel size, so if there were objects in this picture like, airplaines on the ground, or Egytian-style pyramids, or even small shacks, you could see what they were!\"   Some of the biggest tricks played are constructed by the eyes. When the first image of the face on Mars was revealed, the features such as the eyes and nose were most likely created by shadows. In the article it explains, \"A few days later NASA unveiled the image for all to see. The caption noted a 'huge rock formation...which resembles a human head...formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth.\"  The Face, however, is an illusion using the shadows as the eyes, mouth, and the nose.  The first picture that was taken of the face on Mars was taken in 1976 and the quality back then was not as good as it is now. The picture that was taken in 2001 was a higher quality picture and scientists figured out that is was just a mesa and not a sign of any ancient civilization on Mars. For example the camera used in 1976, spanned 43 meters compared to the camera NASA used in 2001 spanned 1.56 meters. In the picture of 1976, the shadows that were present that day formed an illusion that made it seem like there was a face. In paragraph two of the article \"Unmasking the Face on Mars\" it says that, \"Scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia, only this one had unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh.\"  It does look like it could be from another living organism, but it's just a rock on the planet. In our newest image of the rock, it turns out that the face has dissapered. There is no evidence of this being created by aliens, rather it was created by wind and water that has been found on Mars. The reason you might believe that this was indeed aliens, might be the fact that the news has blown it out of poportion. It's just the rock that had some interesting shadows and holes that made it look like a human face.  In 1976 the face looked like a face. In 1998 it started to not look like a face at all. In 2001 it just looked like a rock. So i believe that it was not created by aliens but that it was just something the olanet had made itself. This has certainly got the attention of the people.  The \"Face on Mars\" is not a face. If you look at the pictures from 1976, and 1998, and 2001 and in the text it says that the photo from 2001 is the most recent photo that NASA has. It still looks nothing like a face so since the 2001 picture is the most recent it shows that it is just a natural landform. It is just a natural landform. On Mars there are natural landforms everywhere and the fade away. Here on earth natural landforms are created everyday.  I believe the image of the Viking is just a landform and it wasn't created by aliens. I will explain to you why i think it's a landform.  There you have it. The Face sadly wasn't built by aliens, it was just a natural landform that happened to have some pretty neat features to it due to shadows. There is no way around it, because the pictures don't lie. It is even more obvious that it is a landform because ones just like it exist on Earth! Even though it would've been very interesting for it to have been actually created by aliens, it was just a natural landform in the end.  I know what you might be thinking. How could it only be a natural landform? It looks exactly like a face, so it must have been created by something or someone. ",

                "content": "People say not everyone can do what some people can do. A person can be good at something while someone else is terrible at it.  Not every person has the same lifestyle as the next, everyone has their own differing personalities and character traits that may or may not clash with others  In an argument people tend to be very blindsided and naive, because they always think they are in the right. However there are always two sides to every story, and other people can help you see both. Many times you don't understand what someone else might be going through and it is always good for someone to humble you every now and then to make you understand others. Whenever something is going wrong, it's necessary to understand it ask someone else what they think by viewing all sides or the problem.  When receiving advice, the response you get will be different from everyone. This is because everyone views things from a different standpoint. Some people think it's best to keep their not so positive opinions to themselves, while other are going to share everything with you. It's important to have both these kinds of people in your life, because they're both needed in different situations. Let's say, for instance, you get a new shirt that you absolutely love. You probably want to hear from your peers that it looks great on you. Now, let's say you are shopping and find shoes that you aren't too sure about. In this situation, you're probably wanting to hear from your more honest friend, who will truthfully tell you how they look  People feel differently about lots of different things, whether they are small issues like shoes being ugly, or big issues like political opinions and whether schools should have dress code. What if someone wants to buy a Cadillac. Obviously, Cadillacs\u00a0are expensive and the person would ask somebody before spending their hard earned money on a Cadillac. If the person asks their best friend who thinks they are ugly if they should get a Cadillac, they would obviously say no. The best friend has an opinion on Cadillacs. If the person had asked somebody who thinks Cadillacs are amazing, they would say to buy it. This is an example of why asking multiple people before making a choice is good because they might have different opinions. If someone wants to open a donut\u00a0shop, but their uncle hates donuts. When they ask their uncle if they should open a donut shop, he will say no. He has an opinion of thinking donuts taste gross. But when they ask their sister who loves all desserts and will always support her sibling. She will say yes because she has an opinion of loving sweet foods and her siblings. This is an example of why people should ask more than one person before they do something. The student president might want to start a book club. A lot of students a do not like books because their teacher made them read a boring book three years ago and they have not liked books since then, they have an opinion on books from a long time ago. The teachers, on the other hand, love this idea because they think that students these days do not get enough reading time in and a book club would be a good idea. If the student president would not have asked the teachers if they liked the idea there would be no book club  Children were told sometime in their life that everybody was unique and\u00a0different\u00a0in some sort of way, that there were absolutely no two people that looks the same, much less\u00a0think and act the same. This applies in everyday life from then and getting advice is not the exception. Everybody has different beliefs, experience and ways to do things so it's hard to find one person that exactly understand you to the point of giving you advice perfectly.  Many people like to see what others think about them, rather it be a new look, or needing guidance in a difficult situation.  It's a rebellious stage of life when they think they can do whatever pleases them. So naturally if someone tells them that they absolutely must do something, they automatically think no way. If they have an attitude like this it will ruin the experience and they won't get the good feeling people do when you serve others. They might dislike it so much that they don't even do service when they're grown up. They resent people that tell them they have to do something, and then they are ornery towards everyone else afterwards.  The first step to make a good decision is to think about your conquences. Some people make a decision and regret it because they did not think about their conquences. For example, when people go to jail, they regret their descision they made because it changed their life in a horrible way. Other peoples opinions can lead you into a bad direction, if you dont think about the possible outcomes. There can be some bad outcomes when you listen to peoples opinions, but if you chose carefully and follow the correct steps it will not be so bad. If someone is per-persuring you, that is never the right way to listen someones advice because they are forcing you. Always listen to yourself when someone is forcing you and not always be a follower, but also listen to other opinons when they are not forcing you.  For example, there might be\u00a0some ignorant people who know next to nothing about the other side's situation. When people dont know much about another side's struggles or even their side of the story, they may place too much of their biases onto you or your situation. Another thing, some people have more experience with giving advice. Some people are just more fit to give you advice. For example, who would you be more comfortable taking an opinion from, a friend or a therapist? You may know where to look, but its probably safer to simply get more people's opinions. Even so, sometimes people who aren't in those particular fields tend to think more simply, which might be what you need along with that professional opinion to form a bigger, clearer\u00a0picture. If you're having trouble picturing what I mean, think of it like a doctor. If you get back your diagnosis and it seems wrong or misinformed, you'll probably end up asking for a second opinion. That way you get a more clear and sensible diagnosis that goes with your symptoms. Furthermore, asking different people for their opinions may just bring in some more qualified ideas into your argument.  ",

The electoral college imposes on the American freedom and right to choose their president. The United States of America is a representative democracy. The citizens choose who they want to lead but those votes aren't truly their own votes. According to Richard A. Posner of source 3, \"...the Electoral College method is not democratic in a modern sense...it is the electors who elect the president, not the people. When you vote for a presidental candidate, you're actually voting for a slate of electors.\" American citizen votes do not matter as much as we think they should. The founding fathers built this country for the people. The people should have an actual voice in who they want to lead this great nation. In addition, Americans should have a direct say. Votes should go straight to the president and not the party's electors. This is not only fair to citizens but also a more relible plan. Bradford Plumer of source 2 explains to us that \"\"faithless\" electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please...\" We can't depend on these electors to determine one of the most important things of this country. We can't depend on these \"faithless\" electors to vote who we want when they might do the opposite. Voting by popular vote prevents these mishaps and restores our democracy.  Also, many states may not even see the future president at all, like in the 2000 election where the candidates did not even go once and talk in seventeen states. This leads to a poor democracy because voters in these states will surmise that if the president will not bother to visit their state, they shouldn't bother on making an educated decision when voting, or may choose to not vote at all. In a election by popular vote, presidents will have to make greater strides in getting the people's votes and citizens will then have more of an impetus in learning more about their country's government and politics.  If the people who are on the electoral college are biased then, they might not take people's votes into account to their electoral vote. I know no one would want their vote to be ignored so this is another reason why the electoral college should be abolished. If a democracy means the people decide who their leaders are, then why are there other people who might not represent the people chosing our president. Quite obviously, the electoral college is biased and might not care about the popular vote.   In his article, \"The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong,\" Bradford Plumer specifically states that the people themselves do not vote for their desired candidate, but instead, they vote for electors who then vote for the more popular presidential candidate. The people should be the ones who vote for the president because they will be the ones who are governed by the president. The Electoral College gives no voice to the people and is considered by many to be a non-democratic way of voting and is often referred to anachronism. Today, it is a struggle to encourage people to vote and be present on election day because no one feels like their vote matters. People say that one vote doesn't make a difference and that there is no point in filling out a ballot if it has no real affect on which candidate is chosen. The Electoral College and the process it established is really just confirming these opinions. People do not feel like they are contributing because when it comes down to it, the electoral votes are the deciding votes. The Electoral College only has a little over five hundred electors that are representing the millions of regular people who show up at the polls on election day. In order to make the people feel like their opinions are being voiced and their voice is being heard, and to increase voter turnout on election day, it is imperative that the country switches over to election by popular vote.   By , not making their vote count some people can feel that their voices are not being heard which can lead to in some cases riots and rebellions etc. Voting happens for a reason if gives the world a chance to pick whom they want to see lead them and who they feel like is the right person but in the end if there votes cant count and actually go to the electors limits their power and freedom to speak. '' Voters in presidential elections ae people who want to express a political prefeence rather than people ho think that a single vote may decide an election''.(source 3 , p.23). The Electoral College may have worked in the past but now its not working as well.  The United States is a democratic country where the people decide on a leader through voting, or so it's supposed to be. We Americans use something called the Electoral College, where a state is worth a certain amount of points, and when you win that state for your party, you gain those points. I find this to be unfair, because you could win by popular vote, but lose because the opposing party won the states with the biggest number of points.  With over 300 million people now in the United States, under a unified country that promotes and exemplifies democracy, we have not been democratic in the sense that peoples vote doesnt even go to their president, only to another mind that can cast you away as if you were not important. As stated in Par. 7 Source 1 an article by the Office of the Federal Register \"Most states have a winner-take-all system that awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate.\" These are the minds that are sometimes chosen at random, or by other factors to represent you, a choice you werent allowed to make. The winner takes all method only takes away from states like Texas and California who know their vote doesnt matter because these people will always agree on democratic or republican, and what is currently used in our society. This damages thousands of voices, thousands of votes that could have matter, but seemingly don't. Just like\u00a0 how schools have implemented the 'No Child Left Behind' policy, we should transcribe this to leaving no american citizen without a voice, only dependant on what state their in.  Source 3, \"In Defense to the Electoral College\", even admits that the electoral college is a non-democratic method of selecting a president (lines 15-17). Liars, we are liars then. Americans project an image of America to the world that we are a peacful democracy. However, if the way that we select our leaders isn't even democratic, why are we portraying this false mirage. The electoral college is an anachronism (lines 15- 16). We are a stage four country on the demographic treansitions model. Therefore, our aspirations should be looking forward and not rooted in the past.  If one wanted to, an elector can completely disregard the decision of the voters and choose who they want. Considering the ratio of electors in some states to people, it seems completely non-democratic for the votes of some to be more important than the wants of the common people. Some start to feel that they shouldn't vote because their one vote wouldn't have the power to change anything, and wouldn't even ensure the election of the president they want. Another thing that lowers the morale is the absence of candidates in states that can't be won very easily. If a candidate is pretty sure he can't win over a state, he won't visit it because it wouldn't be worth his time. He also wil prioritize large states over small ones because they have more electoral votes. All of these can make a state or person feel as if the election isn't really in their hands, and when people feel like their vote doesn't matter, they don't vote. ",

These differences in speed mean that sometimes we are closer to Mars and other times to Venus,\" (2). This could be extremely beneficial to both the inhabitants of earth and for future space travel because Venus will sometimes be our \"nearest option for a planetary visit, a crucial consideration given the long time frames of space travel,\" (4). All of these statements and claims that the author make support his/her claim that the exploration of Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it entails as they are quite literally explaining to their readers why exploration is as important as it is. This tactic has the ability to make audiences aware of the importance of such a mission, and hopefully persuade them to agree.  \"Because Venus is sometimes right around the corner-in space terms-humans have sent numerous spacecraft to land on this cloud-draped world,\" (2). Time and distance can be very influential in making groundbreaking decisions, like pursuing the exploration of Venus, as can be seen through, \"...Venus can be sometimes be our nearest option for a planetary visit, a crucial consideration given the long time frames of space travel,\" (4). Humans love to have everything near by, like schools, work, and more, because of the convenience; the same benefit is seen with Venus. When the planet is close, the fuel needed would not be the same if humans were trying to get to Jupiter. There would be less of a chance of losing them. Time is essential in space, given humans' limited control out there, so proximity makes it that much easier for us to make the bold move. Venus's proximity gives reason to continue working towards exploring Venus, just as the innovations in machines have.  The article says, \u00a8... humans have sent numerous spacecraft to land on this cloud-draped world,\u00a8 and then says \u00a8... since no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours.\u00a8 If a spacecraft made by people can not survive the landing on Venus numerous times, how can we even come close to surviving the trip? Venus is too dangerous to explore and it is a waste to even send a spacecraft. The spacecrafts cost a good amount of money to make and for them to be wasted on a inhospitable planet is not worth the information we would achieve.   Venus has great potential for exploration, but with that great potential comes great risk. The author of the article talks about the problems with exploring Venus, but he also talks about how exploring Venus is something that is a possibilty for the future. Venus is very similar to Earth in the terrain that they both have, but the surface conditions of Venus are deadly to humans. There is the possibilty of hovering above Venus to be closer to the surface without having to experince the extreme conditions. With the advancements in technology and new innovations scientists are hoping that there is a way for them to get closer to the surface without endangering their lives.  Venus, otherwise known as the \"Evening Star,\" is one of the more challenging planets to examine closely in our solar system. While this plant is often called Earth's twin, it is vastly different in terms of environment and hospitability. Despite being the closest planet to Earth at times, no spaceship has touched down on Venus in over thirty years. The dangers presented by Venus are many, but the author greatly supports the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite these dangers.  but in reality, Earth and Venus are very differnet. Earth is much safer in terms of temperature, pressure, and gas compaired to Venus. Venus has a blanket of gas that covers it that is, \"almost 97 percent carbon dioxide.\" Plus, on its surface, \"temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit.\" with the level of carbon dioxide and the ragging heat that it has, nothing is safe for long on Venus, especially humans. He does state that several spacecrafts have attempted to land on Venus, and only lasted a few hours, but he doesnt state what happened to them. most people would guess that they just melted entirely because of the extreme heat, which is most likely what happened, but we don't know for sure.  The second issue, according to the people who want to stay grounded on Earth, is important for both sides to recognize. The people in the second perspective say it is not safe to go to Venus. We have tried it unmanned, and the unmanned spaceship counldn't live there for longer than a few hours, so it is too dangerous. \"On the planet\u0092s surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet. These conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth...\" (Paragraph 3). This quote helps support the second perspective for wanting NASA to kept its space ships from going to Venus. As the quote says, Venus is a very dangerous planet.  A planet that has enough heat and pressure to melt most metals and crush any submarine may not sound like an ideal location to visit, but scientists at NASA are determined on researching it because even though it has horribly immense climate, it may be the closest planet in our solar system to Earth. The article \"The Challenge of Exploring Venus,\" the author speaks of how scientists strongly believe that learning more about Venus can lead to answers about the creation of Earth. It is an extremely difficult task to accomplish, as most rovers NASA has sent there have not lasted more than a mere few hours. In order to research the planet in depth, NASA would need to send living humans to Venus, however, this will be rediculously challenging and even more so dangerous.  In summary, we should continue studying the planet Venus despite the dangers because if anything were to happen to our planet, Earth, Venus would be the closest planet we could go to, we could learn more about Venus and the planet's harsh conditions, and because Venus is most like Earth and had the ability to support life. Furthering our research on Venus can only benefit us, so lets stop worrying about the dangers and get out and explore our planetary neighbor.  Scientists and more specifically astronomers are extremley fascinated in Earth's sister planet, Venus, as it is similar to Earth in certain ways, and is a close enough distance for travel. Venus was believed to once be very similar to Earth in terms of its geology, so therefore scientists are interested in discovering how the features have changed. However, the author of \"The Challenge Exploring Venus,\" explains the great dangers that the planet offers for both humans and technology to explore the planet. The act of returning to Venus seems impossible due to the risks, although the insight that is wanted to be gained on the planet could lead to \"intimidating endeavors.\" ",

                "content": "With popular vote though, candidates should be more inclined to visit as many states as possible and get their message out there. Because a 51% vote in a state no longer means a 100% victory. With the new influx of political campaigns, perhaps more people are swayed from their usual path of voting. While yes, there are neutral states that need a push either way, you're not going to increase your votes ten-fold by pushing past that 50% barrier. You actually have to earn every vote you get.  It only makes sense that the larger states with a larger population should get more of a say in their government, and recieve more electoral votes than a small state with fewer people. With this system political infulence is restored to the larger states making the canidates focuss on the more populous areas. More power to the more populous states also means that run-off elections are avoided. In 1992 and in 1968 run-off elections were avoided due to the use of the Electoral College; \"Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992 both had only a 43 percent plurality of the popular votes, while winning a majority of the Electoral College\" P.22. A run-off election extreamly complicates the election process however the chance of this happening is greatly reduced when using the Electoral College which almost always produces a clear winner.  This is due to winning by just enough in certain states that you get their elector votes.\u00a0 If you win by 51% in a state with 4 electoral votes, but someone else wins by 99% in a state with 3 electoral votes, you will have more electoral votes, but less popular votes.\u00a0 In the system that we are set up with, electoral votes is how you will get elected for President.\u00a0 This happened during the Presidental Election in 2000, when Gore won the popular vote, but Busch won the electoral votes and was elected President.\u00a0 It also happened several times before, most recently in 1888.   Having popular votes system will be arguably the best system to use for the election and towards the voting process. Using electoral votes will be unfair to voters when they are voting because of the simply winner-take-all basis of each and every one of the fifty states. Not only that it's unfair, it also causes many crisis in the United States dealing with this system alone and then eventually lead to dramatic chaos across the nation. Also, having the amount of electoral votes doesn't compare to the population of the actual state. Remember it is still one representative for the 500,000 people in Wyoming. Popular votes should be used in every political system no matter what situation it is. As the passage says, the argument against direct elections are spuriors at the best.  With our current system, hundreds of thousands of Americans votes don't matter. This mass of people is citizens of eligibility to vote. Where are there rights? What does this say about our system? The \"winner takes all theory\" ignores voters. If a state leans 51% democrat, then the entire state is accounted for the democratic party. What about those 49% of republicans. Where does their vote go? - down the toliet along with the credibility and accuracy of the electoral college.  If the United States went to a population voting system the percentage of votes would increase dramaticly to cause a honest election.  If the people are barely being represented, and a state with less than a million voters has as much say as a state with 35 million voters, then it doesn't matter if the process gives a clear winner.  What i mean is \"Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but the slate of electors, who in turn elect the president.\" Americans have always wanted to be in power and have a say in what we do but in the case of voting we do not. By doing this we are allowing the government to make all of the decisions for us, as if we were children. When you turn to the legal age for vothing your vote should count. With this majority does not rule, for instance say our votes of 46 percent and 54 percent were to come in. The man of the 46 percent still has a chance of winning when the people had already voted. The problem with that is at that point the peoples word goes out the window, and the government once again jumps in demanding that they choose.  The Electoral College should be rid of. The process is not democratic and misrepresents voting citizens in more ways than one. If voters were able to directly vote for canidates then more states would actively engage in the campaign and all people would be represented equally. It would lower the chance for downfall, and the chance for incidents to occur. I propose that the next presidential election should use the process of popular vote to choose the next president for the United States.  In essence, the Electoral College is necessary for the balance and order in the United States to remain. It provides a fair representation and campaign for all regions, allows votes from states with fewer population numbers to have significance, and avoids the issue of trying to determine the president when neither receives the majority vote. This all shows that fewer problems arise when using this procedure, rather than if they use majority vote. \"You help choose your state's electors when you vote for President because when you vote for your candidate you are actually voting for your candidate's electors.\" This shows that the citizens still have power in choosing their candidate and it creates a balance with other parties. In conclusion, the Electoral College should be kept to preserve the integrity and equality the United States is all about.    ",

Sadly, another team beat them, but my mom learned something very important that day. She learned that it was okay to loose, and how to accept that it will happen again in the future. Ever since then, when she lost something, she accepted it, and wasn't upset. My friend Generic_Name, from elementary school used to do track with me, but moved onto another sport. She was unbareably talented, and was as fast as a cheetah. When she won her first championship, she learned how to be humble, and learned not to think that she was better than anyone else on our team just because she won the championship. She didn't just do that though, she was able to encourage other people on the team to be humble as well, and not to brag if you did really good on something. In later situations, she knew not to brag or boast about the fact that she did better than someone else. Doing an activity helps people be better, and could help the students of the school be better as well.  Most of the advice that you will need it things like school or ideas.  You can even get advice on which classes to take next year or what sports you want to do or how you can convince your parents to let you do the sport that you want to do.  The best way to get better at sports is to seek advice from people who have played it for a long time.  Most sports like basketball or wrestling are just experience dominates.  In basketball if you are guarding someone with a lot of experience then it is going to be a lot harder because they already know the sport like the back of their hand.  It is always the best to seek advice from older players.  Because they have played the sport longer than you have and know how most people play.  The more advice that you seek from them the more answers you will get to your questions.  Obesity and depression can both be linked to overworking students and not giving them enough time to go do something else. This is why schools need extracurricular activities. Sports and music are both helpful in this way. At a young age, many children are encouraged to go outside and participate in their local sports team by their parents. The parents do this so the children can get exercise and grow up leading a healthier lifestyle which combines academics and physical activity. Team sports, like soccer, football, or basketball, also teach students about teamwork and build up their self-confidence, which benefits their mental health as well. Team members meet each other just about every week, and over time, this relationship builds into a friendship. Individuals can feel that they belong in the team and treat almost like a second family. This sense of belonging benefits their mental health, which in turn benefits their performance in the classroom, which benefits their life overall.  On the other hand their will be many mad students and parents because that student is not able to play the sport that he or she may love. and also the coaches may get mad too because one of his or her best plays may not be making the grades that he or she needs to make to play this sport.  make them believe they wont be successful without playing the sport they love.  If you are involved in sports there are many expenses that come with the honor. You have to buy the right shoes and clothes to practice in, but that's not all. Getting training lessons for the activity can be very expensive and a hard task to achieve. Also, their parents might want to use the money for other things that are important to them like a family vacation, or eating out. Lastly, they may be participating in an activity out of school that is expensive, and having to pay for both a school activity, and after school activity can be difficult.  Students are in school receiving teacher-designed projects all year. On a students summer break, they should at least be able to create a project that interest them. Many young kids, between 3-7, try many different sports like; soccer, basketball, dance, gymnastics, baseball, cheer leading, flag football, etc. parents enroll their kids in different things so they can discover their interest young and stick to what does interest them to improve.\u00a0Many high schools have electives to chose from as an extra class for students to find their interest. If teachers picked the elective classes for the students there is a good chance the student would not enjoy the class, destroying the point of an elective. By letting students branch out and selecting things that they enjoy could create an amazing project.  It is very important to have good friends throughout middle school and high school because you will need people to talk to about things, support you in situations. and even just to share laughter and spend time with that aren't your family. For example, when i started middle school my parents made me try out for track, which i really didn't want to do. After a few days, i had made so many great friends that i could not only hang out with at practice, but i also then knew them at school. To this day, i am even better friends with those people, therefore, i can't imagine what my life would be like if i hadn't tried out for track. Another example is my older brother made his closest friends, Generic_Name and Generic_Name, in football when he first started high school. Before that, he didn't have many good friends; football really changed his life in that way, for i never see him happier than when he is with them.  when I asked my friends for their opinion on the sport of basketball it not only made me contact them and talk to them but now they know that I am working on a report for school. This helps all of us out because know they know i'm working on my report which means I can't hang out right now and I reminded them about it and made them do it. In addition, this happens a lot when my mom asks one of our neighbors for their opinion on a certain product, but it ends up turning into them catching up and talking for the first time in a while. This helps my mom and our neighbors to stay in touch and get better opinions on products or services.  sometimes being in a sport helps students to have better concentration and energy, which will cause them to be better in school.

The Electoral College is used in the United States to elect a president, yet it is higly debated over whether it is needed or not. The Electoral College was founded to compromise the election of a president between the people and Congress, to try to avoid problems between both parties. Many people allign themselves with one side to argue that it is needed to eliminate unfair advantages, or that it is not needed because it doesn't give the people the power to elect their president. This brings up disputes and controversy especially in situations that give evidence to support both cases, such as the 2000 presidential election between Al Gore and George Bush.  It has come to my attention the many problems that the Electoral College has. I would like to ask that we change to election by popular vote for the President of the United States.  Arguements on whether the state senator should favor in keeping the Electoral College or change to election by popular vote for the president of the United States are occuring today.  i think that the Electoral College should not be able to elect the president.

                "content": "When given the option to to stay at home to complete school, in opposition to going to school to complete school, nine out of ten students would agree in an instant to stay home. When further asking them their reasoning, the responses your most likely to receive consists of this : \"Im\u00a0going to go out and chill with my friends\", \"Im going to sleep in everyday\", \"im going to\u00a0go out shopping\", or flat out \"Im not going to do any work.\" The distance aspect of distance learning, when in the hands of people who initially didn't chose to go to school, will be full of procrastination and laziness. There can be measures applied to attempt to weed out the students that are straggling and try to help them develop better work habits, such as retake policies and extra help, but if a student doesn't care for what he or she is being told to work on, inevitably they will figure out a way around that work.  Allow studnets to have freedom in their life without having to be forced to do things,Students will have a wide variety of options and their limits are know through their experiences.     While school is a vaulable place to learn new information and facts, it is really a place for children to grow and become more independent and better human beings. While grades matter, the emotional and pyschological health of a student is far more valuable. The FACS technology could act as an army of school counselers. High School and Middle School students tend not to share their emotions, even with their parents. FACS could idntify students that are emotionally troubled, have depression, contemplate self harm or even have mental illness. Once students like these are identified then counselers and social workers could step in, allowing for students to be helped. Right now students that struggle with these issues do not share their feelings. They do not get help and carry on like they are fine. While many may turn out to be okay, even one taking their own life or somebody's else, is too much. While FACS may not be able to help or eliminate all signs of emotional distress, it can surely make a difference. Another benfit of using FACS is that it reads emotoins silently. Students don't have to potray a certain emotion for the technology to understand what they are really feeling. If a studnet is asked how they are, they probably give a surface level, I am fine, answer. The technology reads through that completely, eliminating awkard one on one conversatoins with conselers, and allowing for all students to be reached.  Do you want to stay at home? There's a lot of countries around the world where schools offer distance learning. Distance learning is where students can stay at home and be home schooled. It can either be online courses or video conferencing. Some people may say that students won't benefit from being able to attend classes from home because they won't be able to meet new people and experience the real world. However, they are incorrect because some students get frustrated around others or even gets bullied which can cause them to not focus and do well  Adding onto getting work done, many students prefer working in an environment special or more comfortable to them. One major reasoning for that is one's medical conditions. Nowadays, many public schools offer a special education program, but to many, the system might not exactly meet their requirements. Many handicap students need special transportation, seating, and feeding, which schools may not be able to provide. They also require alert attention at all times because anything could happen to cause them discomfort, pain, or even to fall down. Other students going through a health issue may find schooling at home to be rather more comfortable due to the same reasons. At home, the students will have their family members to look and care for them. Besides the staff not being able to properly handle students in need of\u00a0altunitive care, the, \"regular,\" students attending the school can also be an issue. Kids of today are not the nicest and love tearing others down on their insecurities. Bullying could be a serious concern to many special education students.  The biggest reason why students shouldn't take at-home courses is because it's more affordable to go to public school.  At-home schooling is not beneficial for students, because they wont receive proper socialization, proper education, and it's generally less affordable. As controversial as this issue is, it's important to note that public schooling is the best option for everyone. Many leaders in the public school system work hard to make sure that a good learning environment is put in place for the youth of the county. A majority of a students best memories take place in public school. Parents need to make sure that their kids are receiving proper education in the right place: public school.  It would take time for parents to be taught how to properly teach to their children, and even if they can, they may not have the time to. Further more, most parents work at the same time school is in session; parents should not be depended on to home school\u00a0every day and every week. Even if a parent can stay at home, they would most likely have the more important matters of completing chores, such as cleaning and cooking, for the family.  some students don't enjoy public school so taking courses at home is more comfortable\u00a0for those,  If a student wishes to be home schooled, participate in at-home courses, or attend an online school, they will need to pay for the following: textbooks, the tuition to the online course, a computer, a calculator, certain teaching software, and possibly more. If a student wishes to go to public school, they will need to pay for: supplies. It's definitely more affordable to attend a public school rather than participate in at-home schooling. Many low income families can't afford it, and even some high income families aren't interested in wasting so much money when they can just put their kid through free public education. Putting a student through public school makes it easy and affordable for everyone. ",

                "content": "By this the number is much smaller since each country is weighed and is worth certain points and decided by electors you choosed to trust to vote for the same president you did. You still are in control just that you choose somebody he/her is not likely to change his or her mind and vote for the exact person you want he or she to vote for. It stated in the article that \"Each candidate running for president in your state has his or her own group of electors. The electors are generally chosen by the candiate's politcal party.\" I say that if the candidate political party chooses the electors then they must be good and the party must be sure the elector won't change his mind out of no where.  As said in the article, \"What Is The Electoral College?\", \"The Electoral College process consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for President and Vice President, and the counting of the electoral votes by Congress.\" That is a huge amount of work but that is what keeps the elections well organized. Each candidate running for President in a state has their own group of electors. After each election, the governor of your state prepares a certificate presenting all of the candidates that ran for your state. As stated in the article by the Office of the Federal Register, \"The Certificate of Ascertainment also declares the winning presidential candidate in your state and shows which electors will represent your state at the meeting of the electors in December of the election year.\" The Electoral College is what mantains everything professional.  If i was to be voted for president i would like to be voted by Electoral College because , electoral college is not voted for the presidents it is voted for the electors , who in turn elect the president . In conclusion , each candidate running for president in your state has thier own group of electors.  In the first article \"What Is the Electoral College?\" by the Office of the Federal Register, the author asserts, \"Most states have a 'winner-take-all' system that awards all the electors to the winning presidential candidate.\" If a presidential candidate spends alot of time, effort, and money in a campaign for a \"swing\" state; he should be awarded all the votes for winning that state. It is a high risk but high reward to spend all that time and money to only earn sixty percent of the votes. That is why a \"winner-take-all\" is crucial. To add on, the author of the first article mentions, \"Each candidate running for President in your state has his or her own group of electors. The electors are generally chosen by the candidate's political party, but state laws vary on how the electors are selected and what their responsibilities are...\" This is saying that a candidate chooses his or her electors, and you vote for the electors to then choose the candidate you voted for  According to source one, \"What Is The Electoral College?\", each political party has it's own set of electors that equal the amount of congressional delegates per state. Usually each state has a \"winner-take-all\" method, so the presidential candidate that gets majority in your state will get all of the electors that represent their party, not just most of them. This is beneficicial to the outcome of the election becuase it makes the ability for a candiate to get majority vote much simpler. There is less of a possibility of a tie, or an outcome where no candidate wins. Source 3, \"In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep out despised method of choosing president\", states that \"even a very slight plurality in a state creates a landslide electoral-vote victory in that state...\" , therefore allowing the candidate to secure all votes to their side, instead of having the votes divided on the line of majority rule, and causing rifts between Electoral College voters.   According to Source 2, the voters--the ones supposedly voting for our new president--vote for a group of electors instead. Due to the power of the Electoral Colleg, electors can vote for any candidate. This process we have every 4 years is truly un-democratic. For example, during the 2000 election, Al Gore was the candidate with the most popular votes--this meant that the majority of the citizens of the U.S. wants him to be president. However, Al Gore lost since the majority of electors from the Electoral College voted him. Lastly, in the case of a time, the lection will truly be un-democratic; the House of Representatives will have to choose the new president.  It's the Tuesday after the first Monday in November, can you guess what it is? It's election day! Every four years, nearly every person in America will vote to choose a new President, or do we? Yes, we live in a democracy where we can vote for who runs out country, but do we really make the descision? The Electoral College is a phase where electors, of a candidate running for president, come together and decide for who is the President, Vice President, and include the countings of the electoral votes from Congress. The person who runs for President has a select group of people known as electors, which are typically chosen by that person's political party  In the electoral college voters aren't essentially voting for a president but they are voting for a group of electors who will then elect a president. The electors can be picked in many different ways. Sometimes they are they are picked at state conventions, they can be picked at state party's central committe, or sometimes the presidental canidate picks them themselves according to Bradford Plumer (source 2).  By using the Electoral College, we don't directly vote for our own President. We vote for his/her's electors. It's them who really choose who leads us, not us  In the Electoral College, \"voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president\" (Bradford 10). These electors may not necessarily vote for what candidate voters want most as president, and could do what they might feel is the best decision; however, this is not always what the majority of voters want in a president and could end up with a poor president. In addition, most voters know very little about how these electors are chosen and are not in control of who their state's electors are. In a way this system is a bit corrupt, because the voters don't have the final say of the president. ",

So, if these things can be hacked then what makes one think that this driverless car can't be hacked. And, if hacked there would be no telling what the hacker could do to the car. For example, cause it to crash or lead the car into an area the driver in unfamiliar with because they're not paying attention. These examples could all cause harm to more than just the driver and that shows why this car should not be implemented into society, because it has various accounts on how it can misfunction.  The author stated that NASA is working on an approach to studying Venus that involves mechanical computers. He then said, \"The thought of computers existing in those days may sound shocking, but these devices make calculations by using gears and levers...\" It is irrelevant to the message when the mechanical computers were envisioned or the fact that it is shocking to hear that computers existed in 1940. It was hard to understand why computers were important to the article at all. The author made it difficult to focus on the message when he was stating random facts that were not important to the idea he was trying to support.  Not every school has computers and not every class uses them. If we were to implement this software, it could be giving an unfair advantage to the students who had acsess to it. There are still plenty of schools that may not have a computer in every classroom. Similarly, not all students and parents can afford this kind of technology. Because of how new and high-tech this software is it most likely will cost more money to be put into effect. This would cause the schools with more money to be able to get it while the schools with less funding and less money to be pushed aside and not get it. This causes the students at the schools that cannnot afford it to have a disadvantage.  Combining the evidence presented by the author would point to the conclusion that astronomers would need to be using vehicles and photography equipment that currently don't exist and, even with unavailable technology, they must be willing to die to travel to Venus for study.  This creates the idea in the reader's head that studying Venus is impossible, which greatly weakens the author's claim.  All in all, impossibilities, conflicting ideas, and a lack of explanation of evidence crontribute to a weak argument in favor of the idea that studing Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents.  NASA's advancements for Venus exploration are promising, \"For example, some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface and have lasted for three weeks in such chaos,\" (7). Humans would not be able to use the most advanced technology, but durability is the goal, \"By comparison, systems (mechanical computers that use gears and levers to calculate) that use mechanical parts can be made more resistant to pressure, heat, and other forces,\" (7). If humans were to only hover over Venus, the possibilites are limited. Humans and technology have to be as close as possible. Technology that could last for a few weeks is enough to vastly expand our knowledge. Mechanical computers are now obsolete, but in Venus would be a valuable tool, just like the other electonics being made. Researchers have worked tirelessly to continue making Venus exploration a reasonable reality.  Technology, in some areas, does not work every day and sometimes cannot be used at all.  At Generic_School, there are countless days when the the internet is completely down and no electronic devices can be used.  Teachers who have planned to use technology for their lesson have to come up with something different to do, with no preparation time, which leads to misusing class time at the fault of the technology errors.  If a teacher assigns work over a weekend, while the school can provide a laptop, they cannot provide wifi and internet connection in the homes of their students.  Many students do not have the funds to pay for wifi and are not able to drive to a library to connect to the internet.  Even if a student has technology, there is always a large chance their technology might not work.  This is not the fault of the student and they should not be penalized for it.  Technology caused student to be more stressed and worried bout whether or not their assignment will upload on time, or if a lesson will load and play, and it is not necessary.  Technology is not practical or easily accessible for many students.   A project called mechanical computers was first evisioned in the 1800s. The author further supports how its worthy by stating, \"...these devices make calculations by using gears and levers and do not require electronics at all\" (Paragraph 7). He describes it as safer, since gear usually ensures that someone will not be exposed to a certain conditon in a inhabitable environment for humans. He further argues that modern computers are more fragile in extreme conditions, and are not as strong as mechanical computers. He strongly supports it by comparing it to other popular technologies, \"...imagine exposing a cell phone or tablet to acid or heat capable of melting tin\" (Paragraph 7). He explains in comparison, that systems using mechanical parts are far more resistant to pressure, heat, and other forces, unlike modern technology. He uses well thought out support and evidence, to argue that Venus is actually a worthy pursuit even with the dangers it gives. He believe that studing Venus will lead to challenges that will further evolve humanity and help it prosper.   Let's say someone is in a wreck and later come to find the car had failed them, who is responsible now? The manufacturer. The car could fail out of nowhere with no warning signs and even cost someone their life. Though there have been studies, a driverless car could have a potential downfall affect on drivers. Some could feel like they can be lazy and not have to worry about their surroundings and cause an accident that way; A person could even fall asleep at the wheel and do more damage than good. Some states make it illegal to even drive computer-type cars because of a law they have.  At the seventh passage, the author states that, \"Your home PC can't handle the complex algorithms used to decode Mona Lisa's smile,\" suggesting that the majority of modern computers do not have the power to actually run the software. The PCs that schools buy are almost never more powerful than the ones bought by consumers for household use, and would thus also not be able to process the data, making the technology rather useless in an educational setting.  These basic forms of work require no fragile electronics at all. Using gears, levers, pulleys, and ramrods, corporations have been able to create many devices. When made out of an acid-resistent substance that can withstand high pressure, a mechanical machine may work. The only problem with a mechanical machine is that once on the planet, sure it can do work, but it would be unable to transmit and data findings back to a receiver on a ship or earth. There would be a point where some sort of electronics would be needed. And as of right now, there is not an effective enough invention that could put humans on Venus to live and research. ",

Cars and their manufacurers must be very reliable when it comes to bringing up new models of vehicles. Imagine if you could cut the number of car wrecks in half. Technology is fast pacing and is advancing every day. What if we could have driverless cars, cars that could not only make the world a better place, but also prove how amazing our technology is.  Let's say someone is in a wreck and later come to find the car had failed them, who is responsible now? The manufacturer. The car could fail out of nowhere with no warning signs and even cost someone their life. Though there have been studies, a driverless car could have a potential downfall affect on drivers.

Some states make it illegal to even drive computer-type cars because of a law they have.  The driverless cars that Google cofounder Sergey Brin foresees would use half the fuel we use today. Fossil fuels are becoming an issue, but what if we had one less use for them? Without the need for so much fuel that wouldn't be so much of an issue anymore, and we would have more time to plan for whenever the time may be that we run out of fossil fuels. Also, if we perfected the driverless car there will be a lot less crashes. Without so many crashes we wouldn't be paying for repairs as often. We also wouldn't pay for the medical bills and such associated with an automobile accident.  Driverless cars come with baggage on both sides of good and bad, but with a little more knowledge and research it could change someone's opinion overtime. They could potentially save someone's life and other people surrounding them. They could save a new driver's life and could even help them learn all of the skills of the road. With the new techonology we have in this new future, we could cut the wreck numbers in half to seventy five percent. Driverless cars are not a bad idea and they could possibly save this world.  Texting while driving can lead to the quality of the vehicle declining due to any damage it may face such as a wreck. On the financial side, the vehicle's interest rate will most likely increase because texting while driving can lead to receiving tickets and/or citations that a driver potentially may receive.  The vehicle itself is something that the driver should bring into consideration and not use their cell phone/device while driving so that no harm comes to the vehicle.  Driverless cars are coming, and they are going to be dangerous. Driverless cars are coming and they stilll have a lot of issues to work through that could be dangerous. Driverless cars are going to reward the lazy for being lazy, and make them have to do even less work. Taking away the need for human drivers in vehicles will take away great memories, fun adventures, and many valuable skills that peple can gain while driving a car. These cars also can cause many safety issues including accidents from the lack od the cars ability to handle certain situations and could also cause issues if the drivers of these cars fall alseep when there is a sitiuation where there is a need for a human driver. RIght now these cars do not have enough safety features and they do not have enough driving capability to be safe for public use. If the manufactoring companies continue to work on these cars and make improvements, then these cars might not be completely bad, but as of right now they are not safe enough or skillled enought to be sent out to the pubic.  All throughout the article the accidents in the future were expected. which is why the companies wish for the human assistance to be alert to \"take over\". However, when observing that statement closely the accident would be caused by the car itself due to the fact that it drove in such way. The weather could be an out of control factor involved and if the car does not drive in a way that considers that, then the fault is on the car. The same can be said for a car collision. If all of the vehicles in the world are driven by themselves, then it would be the cars that caused the collision. Paragraph 7 touches on the liability issues of situations similar to those mentioned. The issues surrounding the driverless cars are preventable by not producing them at all. That way there is no room for error when it comes to the safety of those on the road.  If further developments were to be made so that these cars truly don't need a driver, while it may reduce safety risks, ultimately the costs regarding user dependency and liability would outweigh benefits. Increased dependency could actually create more safetly problems, and liability issues could result is a crash of the auto industry's smart technology branch. If the concept of this Driverless car were changed to, rather than have no driver, help the driver, then the outcome may be more beneficial. If people still drove the car, but with helpful alerts, warnings, or displays, traffic safety would go up, and the liability and dependency issues would be lessened or dissolved altogether. A new age of technological innovation is here, and utilizing this idea in this moderate waycould pave the road to a brighter future.  This could lead to court trials and lawsuits that would either harm the consumers in the auto industry, or the producers. Either way, the costs would have an increasingly negative impact on the economy. It would not be logical to assume that these cars would be one hundred percent safe, as there is alway room for error, and \"presently, traffic laws are written with the assumption that the only safe car has a human driver...\" Because many people refuse to place full trust in technology that could have potential flaws, if an accident were to occur, the industry of self-driving cars would likely crash, as people would more and more see this technology as danger, and place the blame on the auto industry.  Though there are numerous sensors surrounding the car and the driver is notified when they need to take control, there still isnt enough for a car to work on its own. Even if the car reached the technological point to ensure the safety of the passengers, another large safety concern would be other drivers on the road. Yes, the driverless car can sense when it is about to ensue a collision, it does not have the capability to avoid it, just lik any other car. So, as a human, I would rather trust myself for my safety over technology. ",

You don't want to be in the position where you ask only one person for their advice and listen to them, only to realize they really didn't know what they were saying. The one guranteed way to prevent that from happening is by getting multiple peoples opinions. Now, next time you are faced with a huge choice to make, I hope you ask more than one person about what they think you should do.\u00a0  A very popular topic that has been floating around in recent political conversations is the process, or in more familiar terms: fairness, in the steps used in the Electoral College to select a President for the United States of America.

By asking more than one person for advise on a subject, they can get more than one new idea that isn't one of their own. This way, they can get more than one person's thoughts on the decision, and have different ideas on it. For example, if someone were trying to make a decision on what sport they may want to tryout for at school, they could possibly ask their friends and family about which they should choose. However, they should also ask people like classmates and teachers, as they may have their own ideas, and won't give the person any biased ideas or information. Friends and family can have a great deal of influence on people, so it's important to always get people's thoughts that are on the outside. This will make it to where there's a greater chance of the decision maker not being biased, as they've heard numerous people's thoughts, and can make their own decision off of that.

Although most times, you need a few more than just that one person to help you make the correct choice.  I am writing this letter to you today to talk to you about Electoral College and election by popular vote. I feel very strongly on this topic as it is something I\u00a0 know I\u00a0 will come in contact with when i have the right to vote in the near future.  As we look back to the very day the Constitution was written, it has been a comprise that between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizen that fifve hundred and thirty eight electorshave a meeting for they vote for President and Vice President, and the counting of the electoral votes by Congress, as stated by the Office of the Federal Register.  After this very long and tiring journey I came to the conclusion that ever opinion is important ans really can help you make the best decision. I would highly recommend getting an opinion from everyone you can but make sure that you listen to your own opinion too. It can be especially hard with really big decisions and so for those I would still get a lot of advice from others but also take time to consider each option and like about the pros and cons.\u00a0   \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0   \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0  When someone knows less about a situation it is sometimes better because they see everything from an outside perspective creating a less bias opinion or neutral opinion. When you ask multiple different people for advice on one topic, you are searching for a general opinion/ idea or a pattern in what people have to say to then influence your decision. If you chose not hear from a few people one persons opinion may be bias and can heavily influence your decision in a good or bad way  As we learn more about this topic we realize how rediculious this situation is. Obviously, going with popular vote is the best solution because we will finally be what everyone has been trying to do for decades, be equal. Sir, i hope you understand my \u00e5rgument and really take into concideration what i have said. Our presidents make decisions for us everyday, dont you think its time me get to make one for ourselves?  Asking different people advice on a certain subject will provide you will an immense amount of stuff you didnt talk about and or stuff you didnt even think about. Bringing in different point of views into a two or more person situation will help you decide on whats the best choice to make. Talking to other people will also allow an opportunity for the other person to give you important key facts to your situation. They might bring up past experiences they have had or that their friend has had in the past, they might even be in the same position as you are right now. In the end no matter how hard or difficult your situation is its always better to get extra help and advice along the way.  I hope that you take this letter into your consideration, and I hope you decide well on this policy. Some may disagree, some may downright despise the policy, but in the end, it does everyone a favor, and that's hard to argue with from a logical standpoint. In the end, it's the simple fact that education comes before all else, because it's more likely that one would become a doctor, a lawyer, or an engineer than a professional sports player, and allowing the minimum work to pass won't help the student later on in life.

If you vote for your own president of your choice there will not be any elector deciding for you if they do not like what you have elected. We need to have a say in what we want. I mean if we want someone to be watching over us, and deciding what to do, we want someone who everyine agrees on. Just a few hundred poeoplpe choosing for you is nothing compared to approximatley more than a million people choosing for themselves. In  Source 2 \"The indefensible electorial college : why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong by Bradford Plumer\"  it says that the electors can always defy the will of the people. In my case I believe that no one would want that. I mean, would you want that?  Well, there you have it. My reasons are final. I feel that we should change the voting process because it would benefit the public, so everyone can know exactly what kind of impact they're making and so it does not mess up the voting process. Don't do it for the government. Do it for your own sake. If you wanna make a difference, be on my side, and we can. Together. Now my only question to you is, are you willing to make a difference?       \u00a0     Making this choice would make one feel more better and confident in one's self, knowing that there are many other people who agree with making that specific choice. However, if one wishes to use this strategy, they must also make sure that they are asking people who have experience and past knowledge in the decision to be made. A high-schooler who is deciding between two colleges and wishes to ask others on the college he should attend should not ask random strangers walking down the street. Instead, he should ask other gifted students, prestigious educators, or other intelligent adults who might know how to make a better decision than the student himself. However, even after receiving plentiful advice from others, one should know that you are still the person who should take all facts into consideration, and then make the final decision based on your thoughts and ideas.  Making a choice on impulse will rarely turn out well as you probably have very little knowledge and advice from others going behind it. It is when you step back and get advice from others that you prevent yourself from making these kinds of decisions. As an example, think about leaders in government. Often times they take a long time to make a decision as they hear from all of their advisers\u00a0and take their time, as they do not want to make a impulsive choice. By forcing yourself to slow down and get advice form others, you are making better choices by having other's advice and making yourself think a little harder about what choice you are going to make. Getting advice does more than just slowing you down to make a better choice, it also allows others to make sure you are making one that will have serious consequences.  Eeveryone should have a say in what goes on where ever it is that they live. We the people make up the government. Who draws the line that states whether or not you are allowed to vote. We do! Therefore we should be able to decied ourselves who can be our president to the United States of America. It is niot fair that we need to elect others to have our submission be made. Even when we tell our electors who we choose, they might turn arouhd and vote for the other person. In  Source 2 \"The indefensible electorial college : why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong by Bradford Plumer\"  backs up my response when stating,\"In the same vein, 'faithless' electors have ocasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please...\". That to me my friend, is not fair at all.  If one wanted to, an elector can completely disregard the decision of the voters and choose who they want. Considering the ratio of electors in some states to people, it seems completely non-democratic for the votes of some to be more important than the wants of the common people. Some start to feel that they shouldn't vote because their one vote wouldn't have the power to change anything, and wouldn't even ensure the election of the president they want. Another thing that lowers the morale is the absence of candidates in states that can't be won very easily. If a candidate is pretty sure he can't win over a state, he won't visit it because it wouldn't be worth his time. He also wil prioritize large states over small ones because they have more electoral votes. All of these can make a state or person feel as if the election isn't really in their hands, and when people feel like their vote doesn't matter, they don't vote.  To the state and the state's country, the election of our president must be seen carefully and wisely. As the citizens of the state, people must realize that choosing someone to take control of orders and regulations and the way the country evolves, is a process that needs to be thought of and taken fairly. The president is to serve the people of his country well with responisbilities that can vary to meet the needs of the country,but the electoral college seems to become more and more unfair to those who vote.  By this the number is much smaller since each country is weighed and is worth certain points and decided by electors you choosed to trust to vote for the same president you did. You still are in control just that you choose somebody he/her is not likely to change his or her mind and vote for the exact person you want he or she to vote for. It stated in the article that \"Each candidate running for president in your state has his or her own group of electors. The electors are generally chosen by the candiate's politcal party.\" I say that if the candidate political party chooses the electors then they must be good and the party must be sure the elector won't change his mind out of no where.  If you take your precious time and read all Par. 1-8 in Source 1, what you will gather, is that an extremely over-afflictionated method is used when determining our next president.\u00a0 Step by step instructions on selecting, choosing, voting, controling, and nevermind the problems it has already caused from the confusion of all these instructions. Something that can be fixed easily by one thing: overriding, fixing, and changing our way to popular vote. This would furthermore simplify our country way of voting, attracting more voters, and overall satisfying many people.   For many decisions, you don't need advice of your peers, but some do, and it is best for those that you get more than one opinion. Studies have shown, that the more sources you have, the more likely you are to make a correct decision, and likewise, the less sources you have, the weaker your decision will be. When you have more people's opinions, you have a higher chance of finding the general consensus and making the correct decision. By mathematics and by logic, you should be able to find correct advice if you have more opinions and beliefs. ",

                "content": "each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee, and that trust is rarely betrayed\" (Source 3, Paragraph 2). So when the party selects their electors they are most likely to select the candidate of the party they were selected by. There is also regional appeal,if a president only has diserably mojority of vores in a certain region of the country he is \"unlikely to be a succesful president\"( Source 3, Paragraph 5) . This is because if a president is only desired by a certain region and not the rest of the country, the wants of the rest of the country aren't met and he most likely will not tend to the needs of them, and ultimately doesn't have a chance of being selected as president. Finally, when no candidate for president has a clear majority of votes, the electoral college's votes gove a clear winner and a candidate is selected.  It seems unfair that the president of the United States, the most important man in the country, is not truely picked by the voters, but by the Elctoral College. The Office of the Federal Register says that the electors that are selected are chosen by the candidates political party but that stae laws differ on how they are specifically selected. This way does not seem like the best way of performing the task and I can see how it results in issues. Trusting the weight of the United Stated on the the backs iof only 538 electors is not the most stable way to perform an election. Why trust a select group with this descion if the whole United States can contribute to it  A very popular topic that has been floating around in recent political conversations is the process, or in more familiar terms: fairness, in the steps used in the Electoral College to select a President for the United States of America. Or, perhaps ironically so, lack therfore of directly selecting a President. It is this particular topic that has inquired me to send you this letter regarding the upcoming debate: Should the Electoral College Stay Or Go?  Now don't get me wrong here: I legitimately don't believe anything I say could really have a major impact on any type of consideration towards this debate, I just hope you read this and ponder it's words to fully make a positive choice-whichever path you choose to side with in this.  What i mean is \"Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but the slate of electors, who in turn elect the president.\" Americans have always wanted to be in power and have a say in what we do but in the case of voting we do not. By doing this we are allowing the government to make all of the decisions for us, as if we were children. When you turn to the legal age for vothing your vote should count. With this majority does not rule, for instance say our votes of 46 percent and 54 percent were to come in. The man of the 46 percent still has a chance of winning when the people had already voted. The problem with that is at that point the peoples word goes out the window, and the government once again jumps in demanding that they choose.  If someone were to ask one hundred different people what their favorite food is, they would probably get 100 different answers. This can be applied to advice because, if someone were to ask several different people for advice, they could get completely different advice from different people, and, chances are, some of the advice can really help instead of giving the person that needs advice useless information floating around. For a moment, imagine that it's time to vote for the President, and person 1 has no idea of who to vote for.  So person one goes back to his/her good friend person 2, then asks, \"Person two, who are you voting for?\" Person two replies with his/her chosen candidate, and person one asks several other people, and finally, person four tells person one about the candidate that he/she has chosen, and person one also votes for that person, because from what person four said, that person will do great things as President. If person one had just asked person two who to vote for, he/she never would've known that person four had chosen the candidate that was right for person one's beliefs. Another benefit to getting multiple people's solutions is that the different advice can be applied to the same problem until something works. For example, person one is trying to fix that pesky flat tire on his/her car, and then the advice that person two and person three gave. Because person one can't get person four to help, because person four is on vacation in Norway, person one decides to apply the advice of person two and person three to see if something works, and it turns out that person two had good advice once person one figured out what person two was trying to say. Basically, multiple answers can lead to the best answer and many solutions can be applied to the same problem until something works.  Eeveryone should have a say in what goes on where ever it is that they live. We the people make up the government. Who draws the line that states whether or not you are allowed to vote. We do! Therefore we should be able to decied ourselves who can be our president to the United States of America. It is niot fair that we need to elect others to have our submission be made. Even when we tell our electors who we choose, they might turn arouhd and vote for the other person. In  Source 2 \"The indefensible electorial college : why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong by Bradford Plumer\"  backs up my response when stating,\"In the same vein, 'faithless' electors have ocasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please...\". That to me my friend, is not fair at all.  The people make the decisions, the people vote for what they want and the people should be able to elect a president they believe will give them that! According to source 3 \"... it is the electors who elect the president, not the people.\" Why can't the people be the electors? If the people in the United States don't have the freedom to vote for a president of their choice, what say do they really have? Electing a president is like raising money for charity, the president does all the work but all they money that is raised goes to charity (the people). The people want someone who will help raise the money for them, not screw over their charity. Just like when signing up for a job the boss needs to see your resume, is like the people needing to see what the president can do to help their country. The citizens should be the ones making the decisions with help from the president that they believe could help with such decisions, not from electors who believe so.  Electing a president is very important to the country. Electing the president that people think could help support the U.S is also very important but very difficult as well. People should be able to easily vote for their prefered president with no difficulty, which happens to be caused by the Electoral College. By aborting this process, voters could control who they vote for and have a say in their country by voting for their prefered president. Having citizens tricked into voting for an elector is not the way to elect a president. Should'nt people in the Unites States have a say in who their president should be without being tricked?       \u00a0       \u00a0       \u00a0  \"The founding fathers established it in the Constitution as a compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote.\" (the Office of the Federal Register). People must remember that this system is a compromise for the election and that any change could lead to problems among the government again. The public must also remember that \"each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee\".(Richard A. Posner). This system also can often prevent disputes. \"A dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is possible...but it's less likely than a dispute over the popular vote. The reason is that the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College invariably exceeds his share or the popular vote.\" (Richard A. Posner). Along with the fewer disputes, it also creates standards for the candidate. \" The Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal...This is a desirable result because a candidate with only regional appeal is unlikely to be a successful president.\" (Richard A. Posner). Another benefit to this system is that it causes voters to pay closer attention to the election. \"Voter in toss-up states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign.\" (Richard A. Posner). Along with the more aware voters, the Electoral College is also very beneficial to the big states. \"The Electoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states (by population) lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment of the Senate decreed in the Constitution.\" (Richard A. Posner). And lastly, the Electoral Collee helps avoid run-off elections. \"There is pressure for run-off elections when no candidate wins a majority of the votes cast; that pressure, which would greatly complicate the presidential election process, is reduced by the Electoral College, which invariably produces a clear winner.\" (Richard A. Posner). To sum it all up, there are many benefits to the Electoral College.  Electoral College believers think that having electors go on either side to let one canidate win, is right. \"Knowing their vote will have no effect, they have less incentive to pay attention to the campaign than they would have if the president were picked by popular vote..\"(Posner). So these Electoral College followers agree with the electors actually selecting the winner because they don't have to do anything. People can just sit back and watch the electors take the power, while the others do nothing but be slumps. In source one, the Office of the Federal Register mention that \"when you vote for your candidate you are actually voting for your candidate's electors.\", which means that if voters have friends in the position of an elector, voters might just vote for the elector because theres nothing else to really pay attention to.

                "content": "When students are more relaxed and comfortable, they are more efficient and productive with their work. They face less pressure from other students and teachers. It makes their work more accurate. In addition, by finishing their work and online classes, they have more time to do what they want and relax. This serves as a motivation for the students to be as productive as possible. Online classes are far less time consuming because you don't have to go anywhere. You can simply wake up, open your device, and start learning; whereas if you're going to school, you have to get ready, travel to school, and sit bored in class wishing to go home.  This free time is also beneficial to students as it is an opportunity for them to explore career choices and other things that interest them. Free time gives these students a chance to be involved in the community more through different things such as volunteering, having a job, working for an internship, and so much more. For example, one online student I know likes to volunteer at the animal shelter when she can because she wants to become a veterinarian. Her free time allows for her to learn more information and develop the skills for what she wants in the future. It sets kids up for success rather than failure by allowing them to find interests in high school\u00a0rather than switching subjects every year in college. This free time lets them create a more lasting impact on their community while also finding out more about the real world and what it hold for students when they graduate.  There are students have jobs, have lots of homework, and have emergencies, so online classrooms can benefit these students because online learning can allow the student to work on their own pace. For example, if a student has a death in the family, the student should take time off from school to mourn and attend services. If that student missed classroom taught classes, the learning experience the student missed cannot be brought back since the entire class as whole moves on through a designated schedule, and the student would have much work to catch up on in little time. But, if the student was taking online classes and missed multiple classes, the student would only worry little in comparison to a classroom student. Since online classes allow students to work on their own time, the student with the family emergency can always catch up whenever he is done with his personal business and he does not have to worry about other classmates' progress in the class. That way, online learning can be beneficial to the student.  If a student struggles to balance school, extra-curricular activities, and a job, they would probably find online classes to be very beneficial. When taking classes online, students are usually allowed for more freedom and flexibility. They can sleep in until noon, and then work on a class in the evening. Or if they work to help support their family, they can get up early, get their school work done, and work a job in the afternoon. Most online classes are scheduled similarly to college courses, and will allow students to plan when during the week they wish to take certain classes. My younger sister, who I spoke of earlier, has found this to be very beneficial, and something she will miss once she can fully reimmerse herself into a regular school schedule.  For example, if a student's schedule is comprised of Algebra II, Biology, US History, and English Language and Composition, if the student is strong in math, he or she will likely speed through the course, allotting more time to the other subjects. If the online classes are based upon pace, students can get through subjects quicker, rather than being forced to remain in a class for an hour and a half. This results in students having more time to engage in the activities they are passionate about while having more flexible schedules. Why is this significant? Well, for example, places like INOVA have volunteer programs for kids to help senior citizens that require people to work from 12 pm-3 pm on weekdays. A regular student could not possibly participate in that program, regardless of how passionate he or she is about helping the elderly. Alternatively, if a student had an idea for a groundbreaking research project that he or she must complete in a lab, the student could devote more time to developing their procedure and collecting data than before. Attending school in person, regularly, will likely be an obstacle for these students, as a nearly 8 hour long school day with four hours of homework and mandatory extracurriculars does not leave sufficient time for the students to pursue their dreams  It really depends on the students schedules, for example, if a student works on a student designed project, and plays a sport in the summer like for instance soccer, the work could easily be completed if the student balances his or her time wisely, maybe playing soccer like at nine fifty in the morning, and working on the student designed project at one fifty in the afternoon, could balance the students time easily. Another example on how students wouldn't have to worry about time management is that, students could also make time to spend time with their families, if they ever plan on going to their cousins birthday, or go to their brothers or sisters sport games, students can choose what times work for them, and their work would have to be their second priority.  For example, college applications now require a multitude of skills and are looking for variety within the application pool which results in students scrambling to participate in a lot of extracurricular activities and taking a heavier course load\u00a0to stand out. With these new additions come with a much more time consuming schedule and title to no time for the student to recuperate and recover from the day's events. If the student could take online classes and be permitted to arrive late or leave early to/from school, this would open a large time frame\u00a0in which the student can do whatever they want. This extra time could be used to relax, be dedicated to homework, or even sleep for longer, really whatever the student wants to do with it. No matter what they do though, it is obvious that the opportunity to have a reduced schedule inside the school building would greatly benefit the student since it allows he/she to just feel like they have a choice in life, rather than dedicate very waking hour of his/her life to school. Speaking from personal experience, spending too much time dedicated to school can lead to a very quick burnout and feelings of exhaustion, both mentally and physically, which in turn causes my grades to suffer from school, ironically.  Taking online courses is different from physically going into school buildings because in the buildings, students sit at a desk and are instructed by a teacher, versus, online classes require communication via email or conference call. As a result of this, online students must develop initiative and independence. They cannot rely on constant reminders from teaches and classmates about when assignments are due, additionally, because they have the freedom to complete assignments at any time prior to the due date, they must have time management skills so not all tasks are left undone until the last minute. The students must also acquire mental and emotional strength, as they will always be studying alone in their homes without the comfort of their peers. When the students learn to acquire these traits, success in their online courses and beyond would be inevitable.  Multitasking is a crucial thing in life for you will need to do it most of your life anyway. From running errands to visiting your doctor on the same day, online classes are able to allow time for multitasking. In 2009, they found out those who did online classes multitask better than those who were always on campus to take the same class. This is very good since multitasking is a crucial life skill, and online classes can help this at home. when at home online classes can allow a person to do his laundry, clean his house, and even do dishes and still be in class.  Those types of classes allow students who need one or two more credits to graduate when they are supposed to rather than stay another year in school due to a few credits. For example, in IB schools, required classes, like a language class, may be taken online if the student's schedule does not allow them to fulfill that requirement since it is full. It is also possible for students to take online classes in the summer in order to make space on their schedule for next school year so that they can take classes that are intriguing to them. There are students who need to provide for their families at a young age but still want a high school diploma. Students who have jobs can take online classes with flexible times, so they can easily fit them into their daily life. ",

                "content": "Certainty of outcome: A dispute over the outcome of an electoral college vote is possible-it happend in 2000-but it's less likely than a dispute over the popular group.  under the electoral college system, voters vote not for president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president. a dispute over the outcome of an elecoral college vote is possible, it happend in 200 but, its less likely than a dispute over the popular vote. The reason is that the winning candidate's share of the electoral college invariably exceeds his share of the popular vote. The electoral college requires a presidential candidate to have transregional appeal.  In an article by Richard A. Posner called \"In Defense Of The Electoral College:Five Reasons To Keep Our Despised Method Of ChoosingThe President\" he states \"there are...reasons for retainig the Electoral College despite its lack of democratic pedigree: all are practical reasons, not liberal or conservative reasons.\"\u00a0 Amongst these reasons one of them is the certainty of outcome and in source 3 paragraph 18 it states that \"A dispue over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is possible-it happened in 2000-but its less likely than a dispute over the popular vote. The reasons is that the winning candidates share of the popular vote.\" Richard Posner is stating that Electoral College is more effective because it causes less trouble and does not need to be disputed unlike popular vote which needs to be disputed because the winning candidiates share of the Electoral college invaribly exceeds his share of the popular vote.  the 2000 election only a glimpse of the chaos that could result from the Electoral College. The disaster factor is a strong argument against the Electoral College. Consider 1960, when Louisiana segregationists came close to replacing Democratic electors with ones who wouldn't support Kennedy (11). Also along those lines, electors are bound by nothing but obligation to vote for the candidate of their party, and sometimes change their decision upon voting. Even if it only happens occassionally, it is yet another fault in this system.  his happened in 2000 when Al Gore got more popular votes, but lost the presidency (Plumer).\u00a0 The Electoral College is not fair to the citizens of this country and to the candidates.\u00a0 If more people prefer one candidate over the other, then the president should clearly clearly be them.  It is less likely for disputes because \"the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College invariably exceeds his share of the popular vote\" (Posner).\u00a0 Even if a state has a few more votes for the Electoral College it still creates a huge victory.\u00a0  Additionally, Richard A. Posner says that \"There are five reasons for retaining the Electoral College despite its lack of democratic pedigree; all are pratical reasons, not liberal or conservative reasons. He then goes on and says, \"A dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is possible...but it's less likely than a dispute over the popular vote.\" In the Electoral College system, their will always be a certainty of outcome.  In the year 2000, this was proved, Gore had received more popular votes than Bush, yet fewer electoral votes. ''It is entirely possible that the winner of the electoral vote will not win the national popular vote.'' The section of the nation that believes the Electoral College is unfair believes this because they assume all the power is in this system's hands  When voting with a popular vote system a debate over the outcome of the vote is very likely and will probably cause some constroversy. When the votes form the electoral college are counted the margin of victory is much higher which simplifies the result of the poll. During the election of 2012 Obama only recieved 51.3 percent of the vote, however he won the vote of the electoral college with an astounding 61.7 percent, a increase in the margin of victory by 10.4 percent. With this wide of a margin of victory a dispute over the victor of the presidential election is unlikely and\u00a0 almost impossible to argue against.  But there is the problem that not all winners of electoral votes will not win the national vote; such an instance happened in 2000, when Al Gore had more popular votes than George Bush, yet fewer electoral votes.

For example (the world war11) I got to go to many places like China, Europe, and Italy.  I was happy to help all this people with there problems and when we got to go on a ship, we had the opportunity to take turns to watch over the animals at night to feed them and to make sure that nothing bad is happening like fighting our the bottom of the ship is being filled up with water.  So I signed up to watch them and so I got the job. I had to stay up super late to watch them and to I went to tell the captin that every thing was okay and so on my way I slipped on some water and I fell.  I had almost fell overboared but I didn't, thanks to a peice of meatel on the side of the boat and i was happy that I didnt die. I am thankful that I am still alive after breaking my ribs, and slidding down a latter. I soon recovered and was back to the job and so we took all the animals back to were they were.  So we made a game place were they were. We played a whole bunch of games and we did are ruiten, until we had another jod were we had to go get animals and watch over them. I am thankful to be able to do this job with people who care about me and support me well this job.  I wonder what are next job will be? Will I break another bone in my body? Can I survie another animal watch? Will I survie breaking another bone in my body? I don't know if i can survie another bone in my boby that can be broken?  After about a month we get a call to go get some animals and so we went to go get them and I have to say it was a long ride to go to Teaxs and it was close to were my uncle lived and so we got there and there was a huge sand storm and so we had to go get alll the horses, and take them to the sea and then I relized that my uncle had this one horse and it did not like me at all. As we were getting the horses around I seen that horse. The captin asked me if I wanted to watch the animals that week and I said  , Yes I will'. So I was up all night watching all the horses and so I had to feed them. I was feed the one horse that hated me the most and it kicked me right in the neck as I was feeding him. I was out for a really long time and my best friend came down there and found me on the floor  sleeping . ",

By getting other peoples advice and have an option you can decide on. You pick the advice that would best benefit you and help you. Seeing what would other people would do if they were in the same boat as you and how they would take care of it will make you want to make the right one. I think it's a good thing that people ask more than one person for advice because I like to the answer a problem that I feel the most comfortable with and that I know won't get me in trouble. I feel like asking multiple people for advice is great because you trying to fix a problem and you are thinking about solutions and getting more than one way to go about it. You also see how others would act in a problem so I think getting multiple advice is important.  You share the same interests, and liking the same things as someone else is a good way to bond and socialize with people. I met a lot of people through after-school volleyball, and I am still friends with most of them to this day. Our team would go out to restaurants after our games whether we won or lost because we were friends, and we liked to play together. We all liked playing the sport, so it was easy to make friends with each other. I also met a lot of people through my art club because we liked to draw, and we liked to talk to each other. If you have trouble making friends, you will most likely be able to socialize and bond with others through these events. I met one of my best friends through after-school dance classes when I was in elementary school. We enjoy dancing and listening to music together. Not only are extracurricular activities able to help you get to know people, but they can also help you find your interests.  An example of this would be when\u00a0I got invited to two birthday parties on the same day that were almost the same time. One birthday party was for my friend who I had not seen in a little over a month, while while the other birthday party was for my cousin who I saw quite often, but I would feel bad missing his party. I asked three friends whether I should go to my cousin's or my friend's birthday party. Two of my friends said to go to my friend's birthday party and one of my friends said to go to my cousin's birthday party. I decided to go to my friend's birthday party because I hadn't seen her in a while and I missed her. I also decided I would take my cousin out to dinner to celebrate his birthday. I am very glad that I talked to my friends because they helped me make the best choice that was possible.  Because students are on vocations, this is their time to get caught up on their favorite hobbies and fun activities with their friends and one last thing they would want to think about is doing some sort of homework during their free relaxing time with family and friends moreover on a summer morning. For instance, lets say a student wants to hang out with friends on a saturday evening, but they remember they have a whole packet of work that was assigned to them before summer vocation and that by the end of summer before school starts, they have to finish it. The student will most liekly be worried and concerned about getting it over with and that means they will either cancell hanging out with friends and stay home doing random summer assigned homework on a saturday, but this is not the case when you know you are working with you teacher and that they will be able to walk you through all the work. Students surely worry less when they are working with a teacher on summer projects hence them doing something fun and relaxing in their free time sinc their teacher is available at any given point. School related projects or assignments are more easier to handle when your teacher is always there to work with you on that specific assigned assignment. As a result, students are much likely to enjoy their time away from school without anything bothering them for whatsoever case. Since students have already endured and served their time on the previous school year, they do not need any kind of aspect worrying them to the point where they have to stay home rather than them having fun and enjoying themselves and having a good time on a summer beach day while having fresh air and cooling off. Therefore, summer projects should be teacher-designed since students are not getting overwhelmed with what they need complete, but rather having some fun time with their friends and telling jokes and laughing them off with their relatives and maybe their pets who knows.  So you want to either go to the army or the navy and you need help with choosing, you love the land and the sea so thats not a problem. You go to ask your family they might be full ride or not they love you so they dont want you making a decision that could maybe cause you your life. Now, you ask your friends about it they say army because its cooler and you get to shoot guns. You realize they wern't much help so you ask a army man and a navy man, they tell you all the things you have to go through in training and in the real world, you think about all the posiblites and dangers for going into it you havent thought about when you asked your friends.  While I was in the Seagoing Cowboys program I made nine trips it was the most of any Seagoing Cowboy it was great. I saw so many amazing places I thought I would never be able to see because I was just a normal person in my town. I saw Europe and China while I was in the program it was a great experience for me as a almost adult. I also had the advantage of taking a gondola ride in Venice,Italy, it was the city with the streets of water. I also had a awesome chance at touring the excavated castle in Crete and marveled at the Panama Canal on my way to China in the Seagoing trip. You should join it so you can see all those amazing places I just stated to you that I have seen because of this amazing experience in the Seagoing Cowboys. Another reason you should join it is because if you are almost 18 and you do not want to get military drafted then join this, they count it as your service or they did for me which means they will for you. Another one is after the animals get dropped off and we are going back with no animals we get to play amazing games in the stalls that the animals were in like baseball and volleyball, we also played table-tennis tournaments or even boxing.  These are all the amazing things i got to do and see, you could see and do them to if you join Seagoing Cowboys.  When I get in my car and just drive, it is always fun. The feeling of being free and being able to go wherever you want and just to be able to drive is amazing. I think that many people love to drive and if we made automatic cars the manual cars would start to dissappear. Making many people upset and many others miss out of the wonders of driving. Diving a car can help build and develop many skills that can be helpful in every day life and even at work. Driving can help you develop your reflexes and your ability to spot details and be somewhat predictive of what others might do. That can help with plenty of jobs including sports. Learning to drive a car is one of the memories that you will remeber forever. If we have automatic cars then we will miss out on those memories.  Some of my friends go home and do nothing after school. It can get boring to have nothing to do for the remainder of the day. Participating in an after-school activity can pass time and help you to not be bored, especially if you are participating in an activity you enjoy. When I was in elementary school, I went to an after-school art club so I could pass the time doing something that I liked. I also did after-school soccer in the fourth grade, and I started playing volleyball in the fourth grade. I am still playing volleyball to this day. These kinds of activities can give you something to do instead of going on your phone and doing nothing. I have gotten more productive over the past couple of years because I participate in extracurricular activities. I believe that kids can be more productive, and extracurricular activities are a vital way to achieve this goal. Not only is it a good way to spend your time, but it is also a good way to meet people.   . Each person one talks to may offer a different alternative to the decision at hand. This leads to an array of new and sometimes worse options. When talking to my parents about moving to Generic_City, they told me that moving to Generic_City now would be the most beneficial because if we didn't move before high school, we would probably have to leave in the middle of the school year later on. In addition, some friends helped me see that moving to Generic_City would open an entirely new set of doors. My brother fantasized about the enjoyable vacations we could have and meeting new people at a new school. The more people one talks to, the more opinions they get, and the more opinions they get, the more options they hav to make the best choice.  I'm in my last year of middle school and my sister is in her last year of Elementary school, we have a lot of differences and when it comes to taste in activities we differ from each other opinions, but we've always loved doing clubs when we were in the same school. She always loved mixing things and stirring and combining things, and on the other hand I always liked going out and playing sports and trying to get better, we moved schools and we were afraid they may not have our go to options but then we realized they had lots of variety and my sister and I knew that we would be happy there. Picking one thing out of so many different options can be hard but with variety there aren't very many repeats of the same thing, thats why when you choose something that interests you its the only thing there of its category, most likely because there are so many other options that theres no real reason for it to exist again and be the same thing. This happened to my mom when she was younger there was no real variety there were only 2-3 options to choose from and that was that. Nowadays when I'm choosing after school\u00a0activities she tells me be wise because when she was younger she had barely as many as I do today. In the grand total you can always find something you'll like because of variety. ",

Each candidate running for President in a state has their own group of electors. After each election, the governor of your state prepares a certificate presenting all of the candidates that ran for your state. As stated in the article by the Office of the Federal Register, \"The Certificate of Ascertainment also declares the winning presidential candidate in your state and shows which electors will represent your state at the meeting of the electors in December of the election year.\" The Electoral College is what mantains everything professional.  The Electoral College has served us for more than a century in determining our nation's new president. \"The Electoral College process consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for President and Vice President, and the counting of the electoral votes by Congress,\" states the article \"What Is the Electoral College?\" written by the Office of the Federal Register. This means that we do not vote directly vote for our new president, but instead vote for electors that vote for a candidate running for office. Though many individuals are in favor of keeping the Electoral College, if kept, it will continue to cause problems in our nation.  The Electoral College was established in the Constitution by the founding fathers. \"The Electoral College process consists of the selection of electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for president and Vice President, and the counting of the electoral votes by Congress\" is stated in source 1. This is process has been around for decades, but things have changed.  In order to understand the flaws in the electoral college, you need to know what the electoral college is, and how it came to be. \"The Electoral College process consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for President and Vice President, and the counting of the electoral votes by Congress.\" (Office of the Federal Register 2). This system was created by the founding fathers as a compromise between the congressional vote and the popular vote. However there was a reason for this new, seperated voting system. During their time the founding fathers where among the most educated men in the country. Back then education was not standard and very few people could read or write. The founding fathers did not want uneducated citizens voting on the individual who would lead the country. So they created a system where the uneducated would vote for a group of educated men, who would in turn vote on a president. Thus the electoral college was born.  What is the electoral college?\u00a0 The electoral college is a process which consists of the selection of the electors, meeting where they vote for president, and the counting of the votes.\u00a0 The real question is, is the electoral college helping us or is it just bringing our government farther towards disaster?  The Electoral College is not a place but a process. The Electoral College process consists of the slection of the electors.  Having electoral voters instead of having the popular vote system is unfair to all. Basically the electoral college process consists of only a selection of the senators. The founding father have established this messed\u00a0 up system in which it compromise between the election of the president by a vote in congress. It is highly unfair because of the winner-take-all system in each state.  The Electoral College is a process where voters select electors who then vote for the President of the United State. But is it really that reliable? Is it better than an election decided by that of popular vote.   The President of the United States is currently determined by an electoral college. The electoral college process involves the public voting for their elector and not the main focus, the candidates. Through this, many of the states gain more power than they should, and the votes are set up as a \"Winner-takes-all\" system.  The Electoral College is a method of voting for President and Vice President that was produced by our founding fathers in the articles of the Constitution. The Electoral College has been in use for centuries, but it is time that we disregard it. ",

                "content": "New technology is being introduced to mankind almost every second in this world, and now, the latest techonology is a computer program called the Facial Action Coding System which can identify a person's emotions. The question is whether this technology is actually valuable and for what it could be used for. Experts suggest this technology could be used in a classroom to identify the state of mind of a student to adjust the lesson they are trying to comprehend. But, even though this technology may be helpful to teachers trying to keep students active and engrossed in their lessons, the question arises of whether this techonlogy is actually worth the recources or whether what experts think is a great idea is actually an invasion of privacy.  Today, technology is rapidly advancing virtually everywhere. The iPhone, electric cars, large appliances, and many more useful new technological inventions have improved and helped assist everyone with their everyday tasks in a quick and resourceful manner. The new technology of the modern world is in workplaces, homes, and best of all, schools. Technology in school has rapidly increased especially as every student at Generic_School now has their own laptop for their own educational use. Now every student can get their work done through a computer at school, but not every student or teacher prefers it. Therefore, today, some schools offer distance learning for students to attend classes from home by way of online testing and course learning on their own. Many students and especially parents are skeptical of these online distance courses because they think that the old fashioned way of staying in school and using paper and pencil is the optimal way of learning. On the other hand, many people think otherwise, so this has become a great debate in the system of education for many counties and individual schools.  In reality, this technology continues to prove its many values, and it's evergrowing amount of benifits that completly overpower all the ideas that some may think its unnimportant.  I beieve that it is the right thing to do, and that all will benefit from the experience. At some point, many will realize that computers are smarter than humans in many ways. Even though many think that the computers will have internal failure and create issues, I do not think that is the case. Companies involved in this new technology will test the product far before the release of any of their final product. The last thing they want is to have a disaster of driverless car failure. The fact that people support these ideas rather than oppose them shows that the majority of the population will want these vehicles on the street. The advancements that are currently being made and the support of the public make a point. Completely driverless cars will be here soon, and it is only a matter of time before everyone is introduced.  As kids are ever-subject to new and upcoming ideas, it is evident that the addition of recent techology could aid their progression in school and would be deemed as important and valuable to include. If a kid were someone that easily lost interest in a course or was not very interested in a certain class, they may then be more provoked to learn and pay attention if this new technology was included at their school and interested them. By doing so, there is potential that the student would then be able to improve their grade and get much out of this porgram. Also, if a student were to be even intrigued in this technology, there could be potential for this studen to go into a job field that dealt with this type of technology as there are many that vary greatly in doing so. Overall, the inclusion of present innovations and technology should be including the next generations, as success for them now will lead to future success for all.  When someone thinks of the future, he or she may think of crazy gadgets that are made of technology years and years from our own time. However, humans aren't too far off from making these gadgets a reality. In particular, research and many tests concerning driverless cars have been happening for quite some time now. It gets people wondering though; does the development of these driverless cars reap more benefits than negatives?  Though this new system is an astonishing feat in technology, people muct recognize the flaws within this system as well.  Imagine this scenario: a person is faced with the future--new developments that may lead into the next era of technology. The question now is, should that person deny it or gladly accept it? If that person were me, I'd take it, as there is no point in staying the past and be outdated, and this is exactly how I see driverless cars. The problem now becomes, however, whether this technology is \"the future\" or not.  It is alarming to think that less than twenty years ago virtual technology was just being invented, and ever since the turn of the 21st century the world has started to use technology and virtual data more and more. The world has started to trend in a direction in which humans rely on technology. For example, tools like phones and cars are used everyday. Virtual technology can be helpful however, and it is currently expanding to provide humans with new ways to make life easier. One way technology is being introduced to benefit humans is through distance learning or online classes. This new form of learning allows students to attend school from the comfort of their own homes.  In the excerpt, \"The software is the latest innovation from Prof. Thomas Huang, of the Beckham Institute for Advanvced Science at the University of Illinois, working in collaboration with Prof. Nicu Sebe of the University of Amsterdam,\" shows just how recent this technology is. (D'Alto 1). With this in mind, if students were able to be introduced and subject to this technology, there could be future scientist that want to further improve this technology and, until then, would be more involved in it's place at school. (D'Alto 1). Also, due to the fact that this technology is not only limited to the classroom, it is then evident that other jobs could be produced out of this technology being in the classroom, sparking interest in young and vulnerable students. As the author includes, \"The same technology can make computer-animated faces more expressive--for video games or video surgery,\" it is showsn just exactly how various the fields are that this technology could be used in. (D'Alto 6). Whether a kid is devoted to learning about medicne or engrossed in playing games, it has been shown that this technology in the classrooms would expose these kids to it's capabilities and potentially create a passion. (D'Alto 6). Therefore, by including this technolgy in the classroom with it's own purpose, the students would be subject to technolgy that is blooming in several fields and could easily inspire a child to become something that utilizes this technology in their future.

Some potential voters who have no hope have less in centive to pay attention to the campaign than they would have if the president were picked by popular votes.  On the other hand having the electoral votes may not be such a bad thing. The Electoral College avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast.

They avoid the problems in the election which no candidate recieves a majoriy of the votes cast. For example, Nixion and Clinton both had 43 percent plurality of popular votes. There is pressure for run-off elections when no candidate wins a majority vote, that pressure greatly complicates the presidential process.  It does also help release the stress of worrying about a run-off election, and avoids the problem where no candidate receives a majority of votes that has been cast.   Furthermore, The electoral college avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate recieves a majority of the votes cast.  \" The electoral college avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate recevies a majority of the votes cast.  \"It avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of vote cast.\" as stated in the article by Richard Posner. It balances the votes by a larger state compared to a smaller state. In article \"In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to kep our despised method of choosing the President\", the author states that a larger state has more popular votes rather than a small state. The author says this, \"The popular vote was very close in Florida [in 2012]; nevertheless Obama, who won that vote, got 29 electoral votes. A victory by the same margin in Wyoming would net the winner only 3 electoral votes.\" As that being said, the author is explaining how larger states get more attention from a presidential candidates in a campain than a small state does. This is when the Electoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment.  There is pressure for run-off elections when no candidate wins a majority of the votes cast; that pressure, which of would greatly complicate the presidential election process, is reduced by the Electoral College, which invariably produces a clear winner.  because as noted by Richard A. Posner, \"There is pressure for run-off elections when no candidate wins a majority of the votes cast.\"\u00a0 By keeping the electoral college, we could help resolve run-off elections. ",

If there was no Electoral College, the votes that they put in could contribute to the greater pool of that parties voters, while with Electoral College the votes are pointless and basically disapear. That, to me, is robbing the citizens of the U.S. of thir right to vote. According to Richard A. Posner, the Electoral College restores some of the weight that the large states hold in a presidental election. However, the large states may not have all of one party and those other votes can really make a difference.  After all, electoral colleges should be changed because it is better for the people so there is more of an input from smaller populated states, they will want to vote and there would be less of an ability to tie the election. Having a popular vote lets the citizens in big states that are metaphorically already \"chosen\" allows the minority vote to maybe have a chance in the office. Last but not least, it is understood that having the electoral college decreases wrong-doings, but if the elector chosen by the state changes his intentions just for himself, that gives the state no word about it.     In conclusion, the electoral college is ineffective and outdated. we should no longer use this as a system of defining our president. Even though a winner is often more clear, there is still a possibility of a tie between candidates. People who support the Electoral College also argue that its a good thing due to swing states having more attention payed to them and therefore being more careful in their decision. However, this reasoning is flawed in that it assumes that citizens of a state are more likely to inform theirselves thouroughly simply because their vote holds more value, in a sense. Also, candidates would no longer pay special attention to swing states if the electoral college weren't in place so the votes of these citizens wouldn't be held above the rest. Increased value of votes is not a good thing, which this argument also assume. It is the best decision to abolish the Electoral College.    im writting this letter to you so you consider changing to election by popular vote for the prsident of the united states instead of electoral college. i belive like branford plumer, that the electoral college is very wrong not only because under the electoral college system, voters dont vote for the president but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president. but also because it is very unfair to voters, candidates dont spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the \"swing\" states.  \"At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters. because of the winner-takes-all system in each state canidates dont spend time in states they spend no time in stats the know thy wont win.\" Some states can get no canidates out and its because the electoral college is unfair. \"It`s official: The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. The best argumants in favor of it are mostly assertions without much basis in reality. And the arguments against direct election ar spurios at best. Its hard to say but Bob Dole was right: Abolish the electoral college!\" This Quote states that the electoral college is not fair and down right rediculus  Next, the electoral college is unfair to voters because of th winner take all system. In each the candidates don't spend their time in the states that have no chance of winning.  When the elector votes for their prefered president, all the votes used on that elector counts for the president. Instead of going through this whole process, would'nt it be less of a struggle to just have citizens vote for the president of their choice and win by popular votes? Also stated in source 2 \"Do voters sometimes get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate? Sometimes.\" This shows how the Electoral College is difficult to understand for some people. The Unites States consists of many people who come from other counrties and speak other languages. This makes it even more complicated for some to understand even if the process is translated, and just by eliminating this process, it could make Presidential elections less complicated.  In the article called What Is The Electoral College\", by the office of the Federeal register it quoted most states have a winner-take-all system that awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate. In the other article\u00a0 \"The indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong' ,by Bradford Plumer it quoted , candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the swing states. Electoral\u00a0 college is a unfair process because of the winner take it all. The winner takes it all system is a unfair process for the American citizens. even with a slightly change in the electoral college could change the tide or even cause a tie in the election.   For example, in \"The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong,\" Bradford Plumer whines about how, \"At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters,\" going on to say that, \"Because of the winner-take-all system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the 'swing' states,\" (Plumer 13).  In \"Source 2: The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong\", author Bradford Plumer claims \"the electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational\" because \"candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning.\" This means that the candidates focus on the \"tight races of the 'swing' states.\" To continue, Plumer also argues that changing to election by popular vote makes every vote count ",

                "content": "Stress and anxiety among students is extremely high.  Many kids have test anxiety and are not able to perform well in testing environments.  Testing anxiety can be caused by numerous factors but one factor that stands out the most is feeling comfortable in an environment.  If the student does not feel comfortable in their classroom while taking a test, they will not produce a good grade.  If the student is placed in a well suited environment, like their home, they are guaranteed\u00a0to receive a better grade than if they were placed in a classroom.  Secondly, if students are able take their time and not rush through school work, stress levels will reduce and the amount of passing students will increase.  Students often feel rushed to finish in a short amount of time in order to please their teachers.  Although many teachers preach to their students to take their time, teachers unknowingly put a time restriction on student.  Online courses allow kids to start and finish assignment when they feel comfortable doing so.  Online classes lowers the chance of stress among students by eliminating classroom anxiety.   seeking multiple opinions before making a hard decision can be beneficial because of the reasons stated above. When I was in second grade, I passed the test to be admitted into the AAP (Advanced Academics Program) in my school. My best friend was also accepted, and wanted me to go to AAP with her, but I didnt really want to go into AAP. I told my parents this, and they agreed it would be best for me to stay in the normal class for on more year. Since I got my parents' opinions, I also felt more secure staying out of the advanced program even though my friend wanted me to do the opposite and go into the program. And so in third grade, I was not in AAP with my best friend, but nonetheless, I was happy and met many new friends in the normal class, some of whom are still my friends today. When I went into fourth grade, however, I decided that I wanted to go into the AAP program. Since I had already gotten in a year\u00a0before, I was not required to retake the test and went in smoothly to the advanced program. In this example, I sought three opinions (my parents and my best friend) in order to make a decision,\u00a0but if I had taken my friend's advice alone, I would have gone into AAP in third grade and not have been as happy as I was in the regular class.\u00a0This shows clearly that  For example, if a basketball player receives a 65 on a test. Tell them that they can't start their next game unless they can pull it back up. Also, if you have tutors ( especially for the ones who struggle in math) it could help then bring their grades up to a B and possibly an A. These kids don't purposely try not to accomplish As its just hard for them to do it. All they need is a push.  by listening to just one person, you may only get that one person's opinion about what he or she believes is right. It is important to listen to what many others have to say in order to make the best decision for yourself. Recently, I got a bad grade on a math test. My grade hadn't gone below a 98% in Algebra so far. This test brought me down a whole letter grade. I didn't know if I should retake it or not. I knew it probably wouldn't bring my grade up much. However, I still didn't know what to do. I asked my Math teacher, my parents, and a few of my friends. Each looked at the situation differently. After listening to all of these perspectives, I put them together and formed my own decision. As long as I did my homework and got a good grade on the next test, I would be back up to an A and not have to retake it. I was helped a lot by getting different\u00a0opinions of people with different backgrounds.  For example, my trigonmetry teacher gave me a lot of praise when I got an \"A\" on the last test. These praises pushed me to continue doing well in the class. When teachers acknowledge students progress, it motivates students to succeed. For instance, Abraham Lincoln grew up in poverty and had to do farming and go to school at the same time. Despite knowing his background, his teachers encouraged him to focus on his education because he was a great student. Eventually, he was able to afford a higher education and went on to become the president of the United States. The motivation that teachers give to students enables students to become successful in the future.  In a happy school, many people are more likely to get good grades. Studies show that when a student is in a happier or more welcoming environment tend to do better on tests, quizzes, and homework than children who are in an unhappy environment studying. If we take the student who is good at their sport and make them quit the team just because they have a bad grade, then we would be making a bad environment for the people who want the team to win and succeed, and that would affect how they learned and studied. This would not be good for the schools' public image because every school wants to look good. If we start to make our school look very bad just because a sports team lost which they thought would win but didn't, that might make many of our students feel bad and a bit disappointed. Students should be able to work in a healthy environment where they don't have bad sports teams to be ashamed of, but good ones to be proud of.  Sometimes when students have a large load of homework or tests they feel the need to relax and forget about their stress, but if they need to get even higher grades the outcome would be either of these three extremes, extremely low grades, truancy, high grades (but not enough time for sports) without a lot of time students agitation would reach to a point where they might resort to drastic efforts to relieve stress, like suicide. This would then mold the school into an unfriendly jail cell, and other students will be effected.  however there are certain exceptions to this law. In schools, students are required to take SOLs and other tests. Do SOLs make students happy? No. Unfortunately though, it is required in schools. Requiring extracurricular activities is quite on the contrary. Instead of going home and \"pursuing happiness\" on their phones, the teens would be able to occasionally stay after school with friends and do something that they care about. The Physical Education Council in Western Loudoun County in Virginia conducted a study with some interesting results. The tracked the brains levels of happiness through the process of cells creating a natural sort of nicotine. When this chemical is released in the brain, it causes the feeling that humans identify as, \"being happy\". The study proved that the chemical was released more often in those who were social and around other people rather then loners, who study, work, and text\u00a0by themselves.  When considering whether or not to allow children to participate in sports or other activities without an average above a C, what one must remember is that everyone has their own strengths and weaknesses. Yes, many people excel in academics, but there are others, who math and science just don't click with them. By saying these more athletically inclined individuals cannot participate in their medium, you take away one of their great pleasures. Some kids get a rush when they find out they aced their midterm, but others take greater pleasure in scoring the winning touchdown or participating in a club where you help others.  When someone is passionate about anything, they give it their all. When I'm on the lacrosse field, I give my 100% every time I step on the turf. Passion in life forces the best result in any moment. If students were able to lead their own project, then an astonishing grade would be guaranteed. Kobe Bryant is one of the basketball players because of his passion for the game and the amount of work he puts in to get better. ",

                "content": "It doesn't matter if you have a mistake or two in your idea that was pointed out by someone. What matters most is that you asked people for their opinion, and having the best idea you can have. When you ask people for their opinion, it gives you inspiration, courage, and perseverance to keep on doing your best, because in the end, it can turn out to be the best thing you ever did, maybe receiving a ton of money, winning awards for your accomplishments, or meeting other famous people who also like and use your idea on a daily basis. If your idea just doesn't work out in the end, you could either ask more people for their opinion on how to revive your idea, or it can be your end to the project and give up on the idea. Either way, it can at least be the most fun you've had working on an idea in your life.  Talking to someone to get an outside opinion could help because this person doesn't know all parts of the story or maybe doesn't know everybody involved personally. This is helpful because they have no sense of bias on who is involved and what is happening in the situation. This person isn't going to sugar coat their words and tell you the truth even if it's something that you don't want to hear. They may simply listen to what you have to say and will already be ready to introduce to you new opinions and will help you look at it from\u00a0a different perspective. They may tell us the truth to address the things we may be avoiding in the situation such as something that is right or wrong. This helps us because sometimes we need to hear the truth to see why we are right or wrong in these situations. By hearing the truth and possibly getting advice to move forward you get to move forward with all your facts laid out.  It's a great idea to talk to multiple people about something that is bothering you or you are curious about rather than one. It doesn't hurt to ask for other's opinions and it's always a good thing to do at the end. We can achieve something or resolve the problem better if we get the help of others. Someone's opinion may shape your own opinion in a totally different way and it's smart to understand and use other's knowledge to your ability. Seeking help from multiple people can have great benefits such as having different opinions to build your own opinion, different experiences to build more knowledge, and also because it's always good to have people to rely on.\u00a0  Now this statement may seem contradictory at first. \"How would having to go through more words, people, and ideas help me to get to a clearer understanding of my situation? Wouldn't that just cloud up everything?\" you ask. Well, actually, it does the complete opposite! If you only have one opinion, there's less of a chance that you will find the right answer. It's good to narrow down your points once everything you need is presented, but when you have little to almost nothing to go off of in the first place, it's less likely that your choice will be properly informed. Another reason that you may have trouble only going off of one person, is that somebodies advice could be very biased, which could cloud your mindset from the get go. When someone's advice is based only off of their opinion of the person or thing and not your situation or well being, it can be confusing at best, and directly harmful at worst. Finally, there are plenty more options you can choose from as well. This can make it easier to get the exact answer you need. Think about it like looking for an exact brand of paper you need for work . You may not find it at the first store you go to, you might have to drive around town to find it. All and all, having multiple opinions gives you more things to consider, making it easier to come to your conclusion.  After this very long and tiring journey I came to the conclusion that ever opinion is important ans really can help you make the best decision. I would highly recommend getting an opinion from everyone you can but make sure that you listen to your own opinion too. It can be especially hard with really big decisions and so for those I would still get a lot of advice from others but also take time to consider each option and like about the pros and cons.\u00a0   \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0   \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0  The more compliments you receive, the more people who say they like the idea. Many famous writers used other people's thoughts to see whether or not their book is good, and they ask for their opinion. An example from me is my favorite series of books:  Gone Series.  On the front cover of the book, it has one quote from an author, and on the back there were many other quotes from other companies. Adding to the quotes, on the top of the book said  #1 New York best Selling Book , basically saying to new readers that this series is good and popular. That is usually why on the front cover or back cover of a book contains a quote from different people or companies showing their good opinion about this book, so the readers can see that since this person liked the book, then it must be a good book to read. Having an award on your book also brings in popularity because winning something like the Pulitzer prize can bring a ton of attention to your book. It can give you more to believe in that your project will be good because you have many people who say your project is good. Not just the people who say that it's just \"good\", but also the people who point out the things that they especially liked within your idea, such as, \"I liked how you included this part to make that huge problem go away.\" These kinds of compliments makes you feel even better inside, and it tells you that you can take your mind off that one part of the idea and imagine more possible problems.  The first person my sister asked for there opinion was our Grandma. After a while of my sister coming out in dresses the first thing I noticed was my Grandma always asking \"Well what do you think of it?\" before giving her opinion. I think this is a very good way to give your opinion without hurting any ones\u00a0feelings. You are asking how the feel about the dress before you put your thought in. But there are some disadvantages to that. Let's say she walks out of the dressing room in a dress my Grandma really doesn't like and she asked my sister how she feels about it and my sister says she loves it. Then you have a hard decision to make. Do you say you like it so you don't hurt her feelings or are you going to be honest and say you don't like it with the possibility of making her upset.  In life all of us suffer many trials and obstacles of different extremes. As humans a normal way to deal with these trials is to look to someone for comfort and advice. Whether that may be many people or just one person it is usually someone we confide in with our thoughts and someone that can confide in us to be able to tell the truth. At times, we may find it better to talk to more than one person when asking for advice. We may go to one person to get an outside opinion on the situation. By getting this outside opinion this person may not necessarily be biased to one side of the story and it gives this person a chance to be truthful. You may also go to someone who has a different way of thinking as you, someone with a different mindset. This person could bring up new points to you and new sides of the situation to open up your mind to new possibilities. There might also be someone who has a similar way of thinking as you that could help you reassure and understand your thoughts and emotions. Another reason why you may go to a different person is just to vent. By simply telling this person everything thats going on it could help you organize thoughts in your own head. You may not look for this person for advice but someone to be there to listen to you while you figure out how you want to move forward in the situation. By expressing your feelings to this one person it could help you organize and address thoughts in your own head.  It is crucial to consult more than one person for their opinion or advice about something when you are looking for the best choice you could possibly make. By asking them for their advice or opinion you will get a different perspective on your choice, you will also receive tons of ideas and information to help make a good decision. Having more people consult on a decision helps the person making the final decision narrow down and decide what choice they should make. Like people say \"Two minds are better than one!\".  When you ask for someones opinion you should listen carefully to what they have to say. ",

Over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now. This is what im talking about people. People are losing their elections due to the electoral college. One of the major reasons of why people are wanting a change, there should be no electoral college, only a popular vote for the election. We all want a better Government. I only there was a better way to vote.  There have also been times in which a president has won the piopular vote but lost the Electoral College vote.

You shouldn't be thinking about just a couple of people, but of a whole nation and deciding who is worthy enough in our eyes to lead us to more victories with the popular voting method.     Their have been to many instances where a presidential candidate has had the popular vote but has lost because he didn't have enough electoral votes.  Throughout our nations history the majority vote has lost due to being outvoted when it comes to Electoral Colleges. Because of the majoity vote losing out to Electoral Colleges, people have come to believe their vote will not matter in the long run  If there ever is a deadlock in the campiagn the voting will have to go to the house which will be mostly filled with the majority side. So the minority won' have much of a chance.\" Because almost all states award electoral votes on a winner-take-all basis, even a very slight plurality in a state creates a landslide electoral-vote victory in that state.\" (source 3) that means a close election isn't so close anymore because of Electoral vote. But some people will say u can never get a tie. \" A tie in the nationwide electoral vote is possible because the total number of votes-538- is an even number.\"(source 3)  To put it in more simple terms, In some cases there have been ties by the popular vote, or very close ties. In The same article as mentioned in the above paragraph provided the example of one time that this has happened. \" Nixon and Clinton both had a 43 percent plurality of the popular votes, while winning a majority of the Electoral College.\" The Electoral Colege breaks the tie in the poular votes because they reduce the pressure of having run-off elections. The states have a \"winner-take-all\" system, so that when the elections come, the president of those who are voting for him in the electoral college get to be with that president. The larger states recieve more attention from the canidates, so the popular vote getting tied up also does not happen very often.   First, voters can walk into the booth and \"...get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate\" (Plumer 10). Not every voter is educated on exactly how the electors and candidates are represented on the ballot and that may lead to an accidental win. On top of this misconception, almost decietfully, an elector promised to a candidate can change their vote at a moments notice(Plumer 10). Even Posner who writes for the electoral college admitted that it is possible, and he claims that it is \"rare\";however, it has happened before in 1960 (Plumer 11), and not even Posner can control the actions of an elector, legally anyway. Also, when a candidate wins a popular vote, which is the true mind of the people, that candidate still may not win the electoral vote, overall, loosing the election. This happened just a few years back in the 2000 election between President Bush and Gore(Posner 16).All in all, the electoral college does not represnt the people.  In the article  What Is The Electoral College by the office of the Federal Register, it states that the election process is held every four years along with the after election prepared by the govenor titled \"Certificate Of Ascertainment\" which sums the canadidates and electors as well as the winning canadidate. It is obvious that the voters only know so much of what they vote for and do not really get a good taste of how the presidential canadidate is like. It can be clear that as a blind election, the voters have no hints of who they might be voting towards and in the end can cause a major catasrophe if a canadidate has very little intentions for the states. In agreement to the article the text  In the defense of the electoral college by Richard A. Posner it begins to sate the election of Romney who, by increasing his plurality and possesing only regional appeal, lost the peoples desire to vote for him thinking that the man has no regards for their interest and does not have any intentions of improving their needs or helping with creating a community where the people can rely on Romney. The actions taken began to change the thoughts of the citizens and create a petrifying conclusion that the man was not on the run to be everyone's president. This dilema could have been changed around if Romney had shown that he had cared more for his state and his country and thought more about the needs he could fill and the actions he could improve, then many of the voters would have most likely shown repsect and a desire for the man to be choosen as their new president. On the opposing hand Romney had not shown any of those qualities or passion which had caused for him to be thought of as unresponisble and selfish.  The country has more than thousands and thousands of people to serve and direct. It can be understood that having a large amount of citizens can result in uncertainty towards the election and the votes cast, yet it is yet to be changed to a more reasonable way of confronting it. With many systems such as \"Winner-Take -All\" due to states titled as the \"Swing States,\" it can be an untrustworthy election fo rmany voters around the country. The election process not only need to be changed to select a more responsible canadidate, but to create a more trustworthy system of itself.   The electoral college process consists of selecting electors, as you know, but those electors do not always vote for their partie's candidates like they should. This process causes the popular vote to not always guarantee pesidency to a certain candidate even if they have the popular vote. In 2000 Al Gore had won the popular vote but lost presidency because of the electoral college. Not only did one inncident occur but multiple occur because of the electoral college. As stated in paragraph 11 of Bradford Plumer's article, in 1960 segregationists in Louisiana's legislature almost succeeded in replacing Democratic electors with new electors who opposed John F. Kennedy so if Kennedy got the popular vote he wouldnt have got the presidency. Like Bradford Plumer clearly stated \"the electoral college is unfair outdated and irrational.\" The electoral college should be abolished so that problems can be eliminated and elections are fair.

                "content": "One time my aunt went to a park because of an oil spill and she helped out with cleaning the damage. While she was there someone who knew a lot about wild life taught her about the different species. Later in life we went for a walk and on the streets we saw a snake that looked like a very poisonous one, but my aunt with her new knowledge of wildlife knew exactly what it was. Good thing she went to that park for community service and learned about different animals.  Many student have to work so they can provide for their families. Others have to take care of their siblings. My cousin is one for example, My aunt passed away on my cousins 18th birthday while she was a senior. With no other family living close to her she was forced to be the guardian\u00a0of her younger sibling. Having to work and take care of other people can be a full time job on its on, but still needing to finish school in the process makes it just that much more complicated. Having the chance to take classes online would make anyone in situations similar to those life much easier. This showing\u00a0the benefits this distant\u00a0leaning can have for certain students.  Do you wanna take care of horses,young cows,and mules? Well if you do,Join the Seagoing Cowboys in taking our adventure ot help people anad places bombed in World War ll.   The kids who have brothers and sisters to take care of at home, practice for a sport, or just want to have a good time with their friends do not have time half the days in the week to do this  I loved the opportunity to become a seagoing cowboy, even if it was for a short period of time. I was able to learn animal body language and more about how to take care of the animals. I was able to see many great things like the castle in Crete and the Panama Canal. I also learned about culture in many other countries and some of the hardships of living there. The trips made me more aware of the hardships every person in other countries face every, single day of their lives. I hope that all of these reasons convinced you to become a seagoing cowboy.      Have you ever been on an amazing trip? Have you ever seen many amazing sites? Have you ever been on a long boat trip? Do you want to help people? Do you want to care for animals?  For example, if a student wanted to learn how to play an instrument, they wouldn't be able to learn it because there would be no time for lessons. They would have to be doing community service which would take away the opportunity to learn. They also have many other responsibilities besides community service such as taking care of a younger sibling, focusing on school and education, house chores, and many others. Community service would be another responsibility that a child would have to take on and which maybe not even be prepared for.  Without the children there to watch after their younger siblings or to perform everyday chores such as cleaning up after the house or tending to a farm if the student were to live in the more rural areas, it causes the family to have to search for daycare or hire an extra hand which is not only costly but also stressful.  When more people from different walks of life-whether it be age, ethnicity, or financial situation-give you advice, it allows you to realize which of their advice fits you the best. When my older brother was presented with the life deciding question of the future career path, the whole family weighed in. My grandfather, who survived the famine in China and grew up in poverty, suggested she strive for a stable and well paying office job. My aunt, a freelancer who grew up in the U.S, simply said, \"Follow your heart.\" Compiling information from people who all lead very different lives allows you to see the bigger picture.  Taking participation in the Seagoing Cowboys program is more of a different world then an adventure! This program helps you think of the people in need and how much you have helped them. Participating in this fun program is a great idea! Just imagine... riding on a boat, mist spraying, cooling you off after a long day herding animals. You have the benefit to see and tour many places that you have never seen before! ",

                "content": "I beieve that it is the right thing to do, and that all will benefit from the experience. At some point, many will realize that computers are smarter than humans in many ways. Even though many think that the computers will have internal failure and create issues, I do not think that is the case. Companies involved in this new technology will test the product far before the release of any of their final product. The last thing they want is to have a disaster of driverless car failure. The fact that people support these ideas rather than oppose them shows that the majority of the population will want these vehicles on the street. The advancements that are currently being made and the support of the public make a point. Completely driverless cars will be here soon, and it is only a matter of time before everyone is introduced.  Since it is computer what if hackers hijacked it? Or maybe it messed up because its computer made and the driver has no control?  If it is not being hacked into, technology and the internet is also known to malfunction often, which could lead to innumerable amounts of incidents.   Because it is not the computers duty to exlain everything to you, not everyone has accsess to this kind of software, and people may lose their sensitivity to the fine art of emotion reading, I am in opposition of implementing this FACS technology.  If a student has to leave town for one reason or another they would still receive an education along as they had access to a computer  Not every school has computers and not every class uses them. If we were to implement this software, it could be giving an unfair advantage to the students who had acsess to it. There are still plenty of schools that may not have a computer in every classroom. Similarly, not all students and parents can afford this kind of technology. Because of how new and high-tech this software is it most likely will cost more money to be put into effect. This would cause the schools with more money to be able to get it while the schools with less funding and less money to be pushed aside and not get it. This causes the students at the schools that cannnot afford it to have a disadvantage.  As far as what is explained in this article the only benefit to this technology is that computers will know what you are feeling, and the question that needs to be asked is; do we really want them to?  If there is an error or flaw in your idea, they can point it out so your idea won't contain that flaw anymore. An example is the Apple Company that makes a variety of electronics that people. They don't have just one version of the idea that they made; they have many different types of phones, each coming from different years with different ideas of the ideal iPhone that everyone would like to buy. People give their ideas to the Apple Company, such as having a phone with no home button, having a bigger-sized phone, or even having a brand new product, like AirPods. Many people who ask one person think it can be embarrassing to ask someone if there is anything wrong just to find out there is something wrong, although it doesn't matter if you get embarrassed or not. It matters that you got the mistake from someone and corrected that mistake for the better of the people. In fact, having more problems is better than having none, because that just means you just have some more to work on, and if the first type of your idea doesn't work out, you can always try again and again with your idea until it has reached the best outcome it can possibly receive.  there is little use for computers undertsanding how humans feel if they can not help the individual with their emotons.  At the seventh passage, the author states that, \"Your home PC can't handle the complex algorithms used to decode Mona Lisa's smile,\" suggesting that the majority of modern computers do not have the power to actually run the software. The PCs that schools buy are almost never more powerful than the ones bought by consumers for household use, and would thus also not be able to process the data, making the technology rather useless in an educational setting.

Why are so many people in favor of this process maybe because they can guzzle up your money , my money  OUR  money . I say lets go with popular vote not some elector in a monkey suit. We let them have a \"winner-take-all\" system as stated in paragraph 7 from an excerpt from \" What Is The Electoral College \". Why do we need make the District of Columbia like their own state , why should we go threw all the hassel of putting certain numbers of electors for each state when we can just go with popular vote. The vote we have.  If I had a choice between keeping the Electoral College or a popular Vote, I would pick a popular vote cause the Electoral College is pretty crashed and it really fair. I say give people a chance and let them vote.\u00a0 Picking a pedigree plurality of votes from the Electoral College then from the Popular votes isnt fair based on us. No voters vote swings a national election,and in spite of that,about one-half the eligible American population did vote in the election of 2012,as said in pharagraph 23. I think that Voting for the popular vote would be better then Electoral College cause it would be the states vote instead of just a majority of peoples vote that only want a president that is not validated for success for us.  I can see how this could support changing to election by popular vote, and how it could be reasonable. If our president was chosen by popular vote, then he would visit all of the states, trying to win them over. However, there are some strong arguments against this. To begin with, one man would have to visit 50 states, and even if he only visited the majority, there is still a posibility that the state will not vote for him anyways, in the end. If we keep the Electoral College, then the majority of votes in a state would count, not his popularity. As a fourteen year old, I can relate this to highschool. A student can be the most popular student in the school, but they can also be the most rude and mean. And while another student may not be popular, they can be the nicest in the school. If the president was chosen by a popular vote, he might just end up being the worst thing that could happen to the country.  The Electoral College, all-in-all, has helped us a lot, yes, but it is high time we go back to the popularity vote. It would make most citizens, and many potential voters, happier to know that they are accounted for, and we won't have the potential of the popularity winner, the one the people actually voted for, to lose on account of the electors. It should be the people of America's decision, not a group of government workers, to decide who runs our nation  In conclusion, Mr. State Senator, I think that keeping the Electoral College is the best thing for our country. If we changed to election by popular vote, the man (or woman) might not be the best for our country, and the best man might not win because he is not a regional favorite. I hope, sir, that you will take my letter into account when you go to vote on this topic.       \u00a0     Popular vote is a much better idea not only becuase it is more realistic, but because it is easier to understand. Even some of our presidents like Richard Nixon and Bob Dole have thought that this was the way to go. Not only do they believe this, but they lost their presidency votes becuase of the electoral college. I think that they are just trying to scam voters and pick someone that would be best for them, not for our country. I think that by using the electoral college method, they are cheating into picking the winners, but if we used popular vote, this wouldnt happen.  I hope this is enough to change your view on the electoral college. It is not the fair way to let the people of this nation have the leader they want and and rightfully deserve. The use of popular vote is. It not only is a direct line of voting from the people, but all in all has a much fairer way to total the votes. A vote itself cannot possibly change from the point it is written to the point when it is accounted for, but an elector can. Don't allow this to happen the next term  To wrap it up, the electoral college do have pros and cons in a election. The electoral college can give a candidate the election. But the popularity vote are for the people and by the people. I stiil stay towards to the idea that the popularity vote is a greater way for voting. Remember it does say We The People in the Declaration of Independence which was sighn by our founding fathes.     Electoral College is a process that help the United States over many many years. So my question now is, why are you trying to get rid of it? They made so it a vote from Congress would go towards the President and a popular vote from cictizens. Without the Electroal College barely anyone's vote would be heard and Congess would be making our choice for us  In a situation like this, it doesn't even matter what the popular vote results are becasue the College still gets their unique say in the presidency. However, if we got rid of the Electoral College it wouldn't matter if there was a tie in the popular votes because it could just be disputed in Congress, the same way it would be handled if there were to be a tie in the current Electoral College ",

I want to be able to give them same gift my dads gave me the gift of reponsbility, trust, and freedom.         At one point in life everyone has gone through or knows someone who has been through a tough decision. A couple years ago I had a friend who always gave advice to everyone's\u00a0problems. She was beautiful, intelligent and fun to be around. However, she did not feel this way about herself. As time went on some situations became too heavy to handle, the stress grew on top of her. At school she only showed perkiness, meanwhile, she was in a darker place. No one was aware of this until a few weeks later when she spoke to her friends, then counselors, next teachers and eventually her parents to get the help she wanted. She was afraid of what the world would think of her if she wasn't perfect. These people all helped her find ways for comfort and how to get the treatment needed without doing something harmful to herself or others. She was steered back into a safe and happy pathway thanks to the help of those around her.  Everybody needs to know that our world needs to get better and cleaner. Littering is probably the worst thing out there that you can do. Something needs to change because when you just walk outside of your house there's a piece of trash and you can help by just picking that piece up. If you could get all the students doing community service then those students could inspire other students or even their brothers, sisters or even their own parents. If just one person could help pick up a little trash then imagine what ten or even fifty people could do this world would be better in no time if everybody could just pitch in a little of there time everyday by making the world a little better.  An example of this would be when\u00a0I got invited to two birthday parties on the same day that were almost the same time. One birthday party was for my friend who I had not seen in a little over a month, while while the other birthday party was for my cousin who I saw quite often, but I would feel bad missing his party. I asked three friends whether I should go to my cousin's or my friend's birthday party. Two of my friends said to go to my friend's birthday party and one of my friends said to go to my cousin's birthday party. I decided to go to my friend's birthday party because I hadn't seen her in a while and I missed her. I also decided I would take my cousin out to dinner to celebrate his birthday. I am very glad that I talked to my friends because they helped me make the best choice that was possible.  Gangs are rising everywhere there technique is too bring in middle school students. As there developing physically and mentally, also middle school gets out early so there home before there parents. Some feel like there parents don't show the same love or don't care. So they turn to people who they think do. When people start making promises and make you feel good you want to be around them more. A gang is not the answer but most will turn to one. Gangs are telling young adults to do many things such as shoot up a rival gang, homicide. and drive bye. These can land you in prison\u00a0for up to a life time. Teen are so easy to take advantage of.  Its not always gangs. Teen brains are still developing. The miss lead and boredness can lead to drugs\u00a0use. Most teen are miss lead when its comes to drugs. A friend can say its cool or celebrity and then they all think it's cool. When teens are bored or left alone they turn to drugs. They feel as comfort and they get addicted. Drug usage can lead to overdose and even death. Its important the kids always have an trusted adult beside there parents to talk to.  As a victim of this I believe\u00a0after school\u00a0was a perfect fit for me. I got to surrounded myself by friends and teachers. It also helped me academically excel and I always had something to do  After asking for advice from numerous people, you ultimately decide that you want to take your brother with you to Disney World.  Though those people you did not choose may feel bummed out, you know you made a good, educated choice because you took advice not just from one person, but from many.  If you had only asked one person, they could have told you to take your grandfather, dog, cousin, son, etc.  Instead, asking many people gave you a better grasp on the situation, ultimately allowing you to determine the best choice is to take your brother.  Asking many people for advice before making a decision is a good choice because you can examine other people's opinions on the situation, figure out what the best choice is by finding the most common answer, and learn many life lessons.  So the next time you face a difficult choice, ask more than one person for advice before coming up with your verdict.  In the real world, employers are not going to wait around for whenever their employee wakes up, they are going to set a time when the employee should be at work and expect them to be there. Employers aren't usually looking for candidates that show up late to interviews or employees who show up late to work every day. Not being punctual can not only hurt people in their professional lives, but also in their personal lives. Friends, family members, and significant others are going to want to invite their loved one to breakfasts, lunches, parties, and more and are going to be upset and angry when they show up late or not at all, which could end up with that person losing a lot of people whom they care about  It would be wonderful not having to worry about danger or ozone being depleted. Knowing that a energy souce would always be around would be nice too. Everyone could agree that this is a glorious idea and the turn of a new leaf, the start of a new world. A more safe and stable world. So keep them in the garage and grab that bike you bought three years ago. Start peddling.  My phone buzzed with his name appearing at the top. God, I don't wanna talk to you right now, take a hint man. My boyfriend and I had just had a huge fight and I'm texting my friend Generic_Name for advice. After explaining her opinion she says to listen to other peoples advice then decide what to do.  When faced with an issue normally our first reaction is to try to solve it on our own, although most of the time our head is way up in the clouds and we need another person to drag us back to the reality of the issue. Although most times, you need a few more than just that one person to help you make the correct choice. ",

                "content": "It could be that they want to see what other's would do in a certain situation or, just want help and they know that whoever they are asking has been in the same situation before and know how to help or have a suggestion for you to try out. And most people rely on second opinion's because they rule out any other options. For example, if you are debating on buying something that you want, you look at the rating's to see if other people liked it. This counts as an opinion. Or you look at the comment's section to see if it's actually what you want and if people think it's worth it. Getting a second opinion helps in everyday life. People are alway's asking for second opinion's without even realizing it. You do it all the time by asking if your hair looks good or, if they like what your wearing today. It's just a mindless thing we do. We even do it in our head we think about what people would say and we ask them what they think. It's just something everyone does all the time because it's a self conscious thing we all do.  Unfortunately some people don't want to help and only want to focus on themselves. So they give a person poor advice in hopes that the person will stop asking. Then there are some people who are ignorant to the topic.  They don't know enough about the topic to give someone proper advice. Usually these types of people don't have malevolent\u00a0intentions, they just don't know the right things to say. Asking many people helps to separate the good advice from the bad advice people give. It also can help to find the people in someone's life that care about their well being. Which, in the future, will help them make better decisions on later things, because they will know who gives the best advice.  Learning about people's past experiences can really change your perspective. If you're talking to multiple people about wether to do something or not, and those people say not to because it didn't go well for them in the past, then the choice to not do that certain something becomes much more clear. For example, if you're not sure if you want to go cliff-diving, and the people you talk to are all saying you shouldn't because they got hurt while doing it, then the choice becomes pretty clear to not go cliff-diving.   Going out of your comfort zone can really help you feel better about yourself, and not just keeping to yourself. Some Evidence for this is that, in a study taken by the Social Interaction and Communication Association, 60% of students that keep to themselves have lower than average self esteem. This would make sense seeing how if they always keep to themselves, they don't really have anyone to comfort them in their darker times, which this rule could help prevent. More Evidence that highlights this point is when Zachary Andrews, A College student from Colombia, had this to say, \"I honestly never really talked to that many people when I was younger, I didn't really like myself, and didn't think I deserved friends, but when my parents made me join the basketball team, I met and found people that I got along with really well,\". This would show that their is still hope for people that have low self esteem, that just have to have help taking the big step.  If many people say to not do something then the person knows that majority of people agree it will only do them harm. It is the same for the things a person should do. If many people have the same advice then they know that it's the right thing to do. Indecisiveness is prevalent in many people. Having several voices present\u00a0should enforce the person to make a decision. Someone can also put together all of the advice they get and find the common denominator of the advice. Making the person self assured about following the advice people gave, because so many of their peers thought the same way. You can tweak all of the advice to create a better idea or a stronger piece of advice. Usually your own advice is best for yourself, so adding other people's advice to your own can help you make a greater choice.  sometimes a problem can only be solved when you take a step back and try to look at in a new way, and talking to multiple people concerning the topic\u00a0can help someone do this. For example, say someone got into an argument with a friend after being offended by something the friend said, after they talked to multiple people about this they then could see that the friend didnt mean to offend him/her. If the person had not gone to someone\u00a0else for\u00a0advice then they wouldn't\u00a0have realized that the friend was sorry and didnt mean to offended him/her, by talking to multiple people it helped them make a better choice. Besides helping people look at their problem from a different perspective, talking to multiple people can still help people make better choices in other ways, they could get information from someone that the previous people that they talked to didnt know, and the information could help influence their decision.  If you are talking to family member they may not care about your problems or say something along the lines of \"oh honey it's ok you will be fine\" and them saying that is not fine and you should never be satisfied with that answer from anyone. Your friend or close peer, like a teacher or coach will want to understand your issue and they want to help you at all costs because they know that your a good kid and they never want to see you down,moody or upset ever. Your coaches put you through struggle and so do you teachers so they know you can handle the hard moments in life and want to always help you, so you can make the right decision. whenever you hear a question in class you want to seek understanding about the question so you can answer it the next time someone asks. The issue hear is very similar to that and when you have a problem or issue that you believe needs a second opinion they will always be willing to listen. That way they can ultimately impact your decision for the better and you will be so relieved and you will ask yourself why you didn't go to them earlier  The saying that other people show the best in you can be used when talking about giving advice, because people can show you new ways to see something or tell you something that you didnt know. Friends can show you the situation you are in from all different angles and not just the one you are stuck in. They can also tell you what they would do in your shoes, or how they would handle your position. Past experiences can change a persons perspective of their life so they don't make the same mistake twice, but they can also help others to not make the mistake at all. In conclusion, there are many ways others can help you for advice like sharing their past, saying what they would do, and showing you all perspectives. Everything talked about in this essay can help you come to your conclusion on what is best for you.  Not everyone can do things without any help. Some people need others to support them. When you make difficult choices, you always want advice before it actually happens. Sometimes people aren't sure of themselves, and they might not think that only one person is trustworthy enough.  Lets say that their is someone in the school that never likes doing homework, you may ask that person to do some community service like taking care of something. The person at first may think like why do I have to take care of something just because I don't do my homework. If you tell them they have to volunteer in a dog shelter they wont want to do it but if you also tell them they are in charge of everything and that if anything goes wrong it would be their fault. The student will probably get scared and do everything it takes to do everything good. After community service is over he will probably be a better student by doing his homework. If the student probably did change he would probably ask to see if he could do other community service. ",

                "content": "All in all, there are many advantages that could easily come with limiting car usage, including the reduction of smog and a more pleasent lifestyle for the citizens who decide to limit or cease their auto usage. While transportation issues may arise when people begin to give up their motorized vehicle, or if they decide to not purchase one in the first place, as many already have, a quick purchase of a bike or the use of public transit can solve at least some of them.     Many people throughout the world, would agree that car usage plays a significant role in daily lives. Although some may argue it plays an important role or a not so important role, the limitation of car usuage would be a very helpful thing for everyone, and the world we are surrounded by.  Cars are a great invention but it is not necessary for every individual to have one. Walking and biking are better alternatives. The use of cars has gone through the roof creating problems around the world. A healthy environment for our children and grandchildren is what we imagine. One does not think of using a car as damaging to the enviornment until after they have done it. Limiting car usage would turn the world into a healthier, stress reduced place. For these reasons I think it would be of best interest to try and find other alternatives to driving as much.\u00a0       \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  Less car usage will help the enviroment as well as lower stress. \"Transportation is the second largest source of America's emmisons.\" (Source 4). By eliminating uneeded car usage and introducing more public transportation and alternate means of transport we will be eliminating one of the greatest causes of greenhouse gas emissions in America. The advantages of eliminating car usage is less pollution, healthier living and a less stressful life.  The driverless cars would be more practical for some people because, if they can completely drive themselves, the passengers would not need a liscence or insurance like they would if they were driving the car themselves. However, the car would perform the same duties as a car they might own, unlike other forms of public-transportation. For example, busses cannot pick you up or drop you off at your home, so if the bus stop is not near to your house, it is not reasonable to ride the bus to work or other places. However, the taxi service would be able to pick you up no matter where you were. This would also be helpful if you were stranded somewhere and you needed help.  Around the world, people are going around side by side, without depending on cars like they use to back a couple years ago. Improvements shown in places like Paris, shows how the limiting of automobile usage can greatly impact the envrionment to create a clean atmosphere. Not only would it help clear smog, but it would allow a stress free city from being populated by traffic jams and yelling individuals, who are experiencing road rage thanks to the taffic. A happier environment would be created when people are out rding bikes to places and walking with friends. In cocnclusion, the benifits of limiting car usage are as clear as water, it would reduce smog, promote other forms of transprtation, and would help our culture by creating a happier, cleaner atmosphere to live in.     In conclusion, cars are a hiderance. Cars are stressful and cumbersome objects, getting rid of them would help reduce stress in the population. Cars are high contributers to pollution, creating smog and causing problems. Also, cars are a comodity that is being used less and less. People are putting down the car keys and picking up a bike. So why not join the trend?  The majority of Americans have the luxury of owning a car. A car of course, seems like a useful innovation. It gets you places quickly and efficently, and is easier than walking. Yet so many people drive cars that the roads get congested and clogged easily as the cars just idle in the road waiting for the traffic jam to loosen up. Car usage causes the enviroment to decline and an increase in air poulltion,  Individual car use isn't bad. Millions of individuals using cars, however, is very bad. Note the emphasis. Even just making a concious effort to car pool, bike to work or school, use public transportation, or use some sort of alternative transportation could be enough to clear up the air of some of it's emissions, keep oneself and others happier and less stressed, save time and money, and improve their city all in one little decision. It's just a matter of going ahead and doing it, so what is stopping anyone from going out and making that change now? Be the change you want to see and limit your car usage now.   countries all over the world are trying to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and smog. Paraguay, France, Colombia, and even America is trying to get people to use different types of transportation and reduce smog. So citizens all over the world should just for one day not use a car. One person can start a revolution for their community, city, or state. If everyone all over the world could do this we would reduce tons of greenhouse gases amd smog. We can make earth a better place and more healthy enviroment.       \u00a0       \u00a0  ",

                "content": "Driverless cars are the next step in automotive technology and the research on them should continue because they will be safer and more efficient than cars driven by human drivers.   As common technology improves and computers get smarter, sensors get more accurate, and technology becomes more reliable, the driverless cars stand more of a chance against the roads of today.  In the 1960's driverless cars seemed more as like a futuristic fantasy rather than reality, but in todays world, they just might be the next big thing. In the late 1950's, General Motors created a concept car that could run on a special test track (Ph. 3). Although this was the first concept of a \"smart car\", the roads would need an unrealistic upgrade that would cost extremely to much. Today however, we have the technology to make real driverless cars. The toll of human error has been evident in the auto-age as more accidents happen every year.  While the current \"driverless\" cars still require some human skills when travelling through complex road conditions, with continuing developement, eventually the accuracy of the computers' driving skills will rival that of human intelligence. This can be predicted by looking at the accuracy and speed of reaction when looking at an automated calculator in comparison to a human arithmatic. As time has progress, so has technology up to the point where it surpasses human intelligence and reaction speed, and in the case of these new cars, would make it generally safer for the extremely accurate computers to do the driving, rather than humans, who would make a great many more faults when it comes to driving safely and accurately  Younger generations of people in our modern world are becoming increasingly attuned to smart technology,with developments such as the smartphone, smart watch, etc. spreading throughout the nation. The introduction of a driverless car would further stimulate this already existing dependency, which could lead to problems down the road.   In conclusion, if these \"driverless\" cars are allowed to continue to be tested and improved upon, countless lives will be saved and human efficiency will increase. As this fantastic technology is improved upon, the negative aspects of trial and error, restrictive laws, and cost will only decrease. As for the future, human culture as we know it will change to alot this new technological enhancement into our everday lives, and in the process, potentially save thousands of individuals with ever purchase of a new \"smart\" car.  I beieve that it is the right thing to do, and that all will benefit from the experience. At some point, many will realize that computers are smarter than humans in many ways. Even though many think that the computers will have internal failure and create issues, I do not think that is the case. Companies involved in this new technology will test the product far before the release of any of their final product. The last thing they want is to have a disaster of driverless car failure. The fact that people support these ideas rather than oppose them shows that the majority of the population will want these vehicles on the street. The advancements that are currently being made and the support of the public make a point. Completely driverless cars will be here soon, and it is only a matter of time before everyone is introduced.  Technology has become almost fully integrated into today's society. Computers, smart phones, and more are used in a positive aspect; the driverless car is no exception.  Ultimately, driverless cars would have an extreme influence on today's society. The assistance from technology has changed the world we live in and will continue to do so. Driverless cars are the step in the right direction for driving innovations all across the world.  The human has drempt of the flying car for generations, and finaly the idea is fesable. The text referances Google cofounder Sergey Brin, and how he \"envisions a future with a public transportation system where fleets of driverless cars form a public-transport taxi system,\" (Paragraph 1). Although this is just the dream of one man, millions more people believe that driverless cars are the key to the future. These millions of other people have drempt for driverless cars, and many times their fathers did also. Knowing this, many people will want to get their hands on this new technology that is a driverless car. Making the development of these cars very positive becasue the population will want and has wanted driverless cars for decades. Driverless cars have been a thing of fiction for so many people for so long, but now these cars are a reality. ",

This causes smaller states to have less interest in the campaign because they know they have a lesser chance of their favored canidate winning. Even more, canidates focus on swing states. Swing states are states that can be easily convinced for votes. It is important for all states to focus on the campaign so that an unworthy or unprepared canidate is not chosen for presidency, but only large and swing states are paying attention.  The popular vote process is more effective and fair for the United States in choosing the President. Most people can argue in that favor as well. If you qwant the elections to be fair, I supposwe that you will pay attention to the voice of thousands of citizens and you will be fair.       \u00a0       \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     \"At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters. because of the winner-takes-all system in each state canidates dont spend time in states they spend no time in stats the know thy wont win.\" Some states can get no canidates out and its because the electoral college is unfair. \"It`s official: The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. The best argumants in favor of it are mostly assertions without much basis in reality. And the arguments against direct election ar spurios at best. Its hard to say but Bob Dole was right: Abolish the electoral college!\" This Quote states that the electoral college is not fair and down right rediculus  Most importantly the canidate wouldn't have to worry about losing even though they received the popular vote  according to the article a gallup pole in 2000, taken shortly after Algore thanks to the quirks of the electoral college won the popular vote but won the presidency, over 60 percent of the voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now. Electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winner take all system in each state, canidates dont spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the \"swing\" states.  The canidate wouldn't have to worry about losing even though he won the popular vote,  Electoral College believers think that having electors go on either side to let one canidate win, is right. \"Knowing their vote will have no effect, they have less incentive to pay attention to the campaign than they would have if the president were picked by popular vote..\"(Posner). So these Electoral College followers agree with the electors actually selecting the winner because they don't have to do anything. People can just sit back and watch the electors take the power, while the others do nothing but be slumps. In source one, the Office of the Federal Register mention that \"when you vote for your candidate you are actually voting for your candidate's electors.\", which means that if voters have friends in the position of an elector, voters might just vote for the elector because theres nothing else to really pay attention to.  If one canidate is favored in a area and if it has a lot of people then that candidate would win with a direct vote. The bigger cities with more people would get every political ad and the canidates would be more focused there instead of getting everyone's opinion. The other places would feel left out and would be less likely to vote meaning not a true meaning of who majority wants as President.  The Electoral College is widely regarded as an anachronism, a non-democratic method of selecting a president that needs to be overruled by declaring the canidate who receives the most popular votes the winner. I personally think that is the best way to decide who gets in.  The Electoral College should be rid of. The process is not democratic and misrepresents voting citizens in more ways than one. If voters were able to directly vote for canidates then more states would actively engage in the campaign and all people would be represented equally. It would lower the chance for downfall, and the chance for incidents to occur. I propose that the next presidential election should use the process of popular vote to choose the next president for the United States. ",

I think you should only have people who have D's or below to not be able to play sports, but let the people who have a C and up be able to play sports. Just remember these ideas and how it could impact the future of those students and how they will live the rest of there lives wonder how to play that sport and teach there kid to learn that sport, but they wouldn't be able to do that if you do not change the grades to have them play sports cause of a grade rule that you put up. So let those kids with a C average play sports.  This is my opinion of your future change in the school activities. I'm not in favor in this change, if the students are good players, the principal have to let they play at least they have a grade C average, but if the students don't have a good grade, like F or D, the principal have to tell they that they can't play anymore, till they make a good grade.   If students are not focusing on their work and only on sports and other extra activities, then they are defeating the purpose of school.  Students who have a grade average of a C should focus more on learning in school before they worry about playing sports or joining other clubs at the school.  If the policy was changed so that students could only participate in sports or other activities if they had a grade average of a B or higher, then you would insure that they were coming to school and learning and staying on track to becoming successful later in their lives, not just coming to school to play sports or participate in extra-curricular activities.  I highly urge you to take some things into consideration before making your final decision on the policy change. Many students participating in sports have a C grade average. If you change the policy so that students may not participate in sports or other activities unless they have a B grade average, many students will not have anything they participate in besides school. How healthy could that be? It isn't.  I find it very unfair that students are not allowed to participate in school sports or other activities with a C average.  I think that you should let kids play sports even if there grade is lower than a B average. There are people that need help and it is not fair to them if they are having trouble. There are three reasons why you should let students play sports without a B average.  In conclusion, changing the policy to participate in sports and other activities to having an average grade of a B instead of a C should be done.  This would require students to have to focus on the purpose of school, learning, before anything else.  Also, if students have a grade of a C, then they should have to spend the time they would use for sports or other activities to raise their grade.  Finally, being able to participate in sports and other activities should be a reward for working hard and receiving good grades.  As you can see, this is a policy change that should be made, as the opportunity to play sports and partake in other extra-curricular activities should be earned, not given.  maybe they have a job, friends, family, personal things they are dealing with or have to do, and making that change will push them over the edge and stop them from playing. Also a C is a passing grade so the students are passing their classes and keeping up with school and everything else while playing a sport they love, so there isn't really any need to change the grade average. It is just unfair to the students. It is just too much for the kids to handle. it will hurt them not help them.  . It may be because they are not very good test takers or their study habits are very poor. Some might not be able to concentrate and they get distracted very easily. It would be unfair for these students because of their inability to maintain the B average. The school would be responsible for not letting these kids participate in sports and other activities; therefore, in order to give them a better chance at getting the B average, the school should provide tutoring and extra help sessions for the kids who really need the help. The teachers could give them verbal quizzes on what they are learning if they are not very good test takers. They could give them homework that they might better understand and also provide them with extra credit opportunites. The sports teams may despretley need a kid that is very athletic, but not very smart and if this policy were to go into effect, then the school must provide the additional help.  Now do you know who said that?  Our president, Barrack Obama.  What this quote means is that education is what's going to lead us to excel.  So by not allowing students with a C average or lower to participate in sports and activities, there is a lesson being taught. I play sports but yet Part of that lesson is summed up by Obama's quote.  Now based on all this, what's more important- being number one or being educated?  ",

They learn in their classes that everyone has their rights, and taking them away is very unconstitutional, so it's ironic that their ability to have a choice is taken away from them. They don't have the freedom to choose if they want to participate anymore, which is unfair.  it creates a unbiased choice.  Although the Electoral College has a few appealing qualities, it is mostly an unfair system for the United States. The colleges should not have the power to decide the president, that should be the people that reside in the country's choice. Thomas Jefferson spoke of the people taking control of their country's government and the citizens of America should do just that if they are ever to escape the grasp of the Electoral Colleges  The electoral college system is unfair  the winner-take-all system is unfair to voters.  and you can make a better choice.  The process is unfair to the people because of the \"winner takes all\" system in each state the canidates dont take time in states in which they know have no chances of gaining them any power, they stay in states that are more benefically to them  even to make sure of an after-school event, phones could be in great use. With Policy 2 in act, you could be staying in school for many hours until your ride picks you up.  This sums up that the process is unfair to many of the states voters and must be changed to become more open and share the equality with those who are losing thier trust.  Not only does it have the unfair use of electors, but it also is much more inprecise than popular voting methods. ",

                "content": "So, while some conspiracy theorists would like to think that aliens created this well-known face on Mars, they are incorrect. The face on Mars is just a natural landform that was wrongly perceived by the public. By advancing in digital technology, understanding the effect of shadows, and realizing that there is no evidence to support aliens on Mars, it can be concluded that the face on Mars is just another peculiar natural landform.  The \"face\" isn't any perticular shape that any man or alien would want. The landform would be shaped as a circle, square or any other simple shape, and it would not be so ridgid and cracked. If you were to look at the photo furthest to the left, you would assume that it resembled a face, but If you compair that photo to the one taken twenty-five years later, you would begin to understand that to photo was out-dated and that the camera was not as clear as the one taken later. In addition, why would an alien make a structure of a human's face.   The author states that scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa when the face appeared. This shows that they have seen things like this before and they knew that it wasn't real, or alien like. Another example that the author proves is that Garvin said it reminded him of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. The camera on board MGS had to peer through wispy clouds to see the face and perhaps alien markings were hidden by haze. Also NASA can be hidding information about the Face. But, you can see that the Face is formed by shadows, and not an alien haze.  It does look like it could be from another living organism, but it's just a rock on the planet. In our newest image of the rock, it turns out that the face has dissapered. There is no evidence of this being created by aliens, rather it was created by wind and water that has been found on Mars. The reason you might believe that this was indeed aliens, might be the fact that the news has blown it out of poportion. It's just the rock that had some interesting shadows and holes that made it look like a human face.  In conclusion, the face is just a natural landform. It may look like a head, but that is just because of the unusual shadows that the mesa has. If my co-workers and I thought this was actually proof of alien life, why would we hide it from you? What is the point in hiding that kind of information?  In 1976 the face looked like a face. In 1998 it started to not look like a face at all. In 2001 it just looked like a rock. So i believe that it was not created by aliens but that it was just something the olanet had made itself. This has certainly got the attention of the people.  The \"Face on Mars\" is not a face. If you look at the pictures from 1976, and 1998, and 2001 and in the text it says that the photo from 2001 is the most recent photo that NASA has. It still looks nothing like a face so since the 2001 picture is the most recent it shows that it is just a natural landform. It is just a natural landform. On Mars there are natural landforms everywhere and the fade away. Here on earth natural landforms are created everyday.  Even thoug hmy colleague still believes in the \"Face on Mars\" to be a alien made structure. I still believe it's only a butte or mesa. With my evindence of the \"Face on Mars\" only looking like a face due to the techonology of the time, the shadows of the sun, the angle the picture was taken, and our ability to see faces when none are there, I believe I have conclusive evidence that the \"Face on Mars is nothing but a butte or mesa.  There you have it. The Face sadly wasn't built by aliens, it was just a natural landform that happened to have some pretty neat features to it due to shadows. There is no way around it, because the pictures don't lie. It is even more obvious that it is a landform because ones just like it exist on Earth! Even though it would've been very interesting for it to have been actually created by aliens, it was just a natural landform in the end.  So in conclusion it is not a alien made face it simply in a mesa or a landmark on Mars. The proof is in the article when you see the 3 picutes that were taken to prove it wasn't a alien made artifact. No matter how cool it would be if it was not to mention that it could make NASA famous or rich it just doesn't have the proof you need to be a alien artifact. If you look more into the passage it even says it was not a alien made artiffact. Yes this face was very famous it even says \"The \"Face\" on Mars has since been a pop icon. It has starred in a Hollywood film, apperered in books, magazines, and even radio shows.\" (5). See how famous that face was 25 years ago is amazing but it still doesn't mean it was a alien made artiffact. So in final say it is not a alien made face and nor will there be enough proof its just a landmark on Mars that was very popular to people everywhere!            In conclusion, NASA is either brave or very stupid not to tell people about their \"face\", or people just want to get their word out to make other people critisized, make other people feel stupid, or they just want to feel like they are correct when they are clearly not. Therefore; This \"so called face\" is not a face, but it is just a land mark that was naturally constructed by the elements and not alien life-forms. ",

                "content": "The technology that recognizes emotions in order to change the student potential will decrease their motivation.  The science of emotion recognition is complex and is becoming exponentially more complex the further a topic is being disscused. In the realm of arguing weather the use of emotional recognition technology should be used in a classroom can be a very difficult tquestion. On one side, you can say it may invade privacy, but on the other hand, it could help teachers see if students are understanding the topic. The question still lies on which one is more important for both the student and the teacher.  Students need to be able to learn on their own and to communicate with teachers on how well they\u00b4re understanding what they\u00b4re learning. By using facial recognition technology, its taking away their communication skills. There are many flaws to the facial-expression technology that make it a bad candidate to use in schools. It\u00b4s certain that there are plenty of good uses for facial expression technology, however using it in schools is not one of them.  SInce humans find the task of reading emotions diffficult, a teacher may not be able to see this and help the student out but this machine can deal with that problem too. How the machine deals with this horrible issue is state in the statement,\" A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored, Dr. Huang predicts. Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor.\" This quote shows how the FACS mechanism would be able to tell if a student is bored which would signal the teacher to modiffy the lesson in order for it to be better understood. Students would no longer have to complain about not understanding their homework or curriculum. This would allow for better grades and better lives for the students in the future.  The use of the technology can read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable. It helps to understand students feelings, or reactions about the lessons, thus the teachers can recognize what are things helpful, and unhelpful. From that, the effective in studying will be increased. Besides that, it also brings advanges in communication between parents and child. The adults could realize their kids are struggling with something or not. Then, they could find the ways to share, or help. In order to not let anything bad could occur, as having negative thinkings and lead to suicide.  In a normal classroom, teachers create lessons that confuse the students or do not appeal to their learning ability which creates a tension for the learning environment. With the use of this technology, classroom lessons would be more educational and responsive. This is because, the technology is able to recognize when a student is confused or bored by reading their emotional and facial expressions. This is useful since the system can alter a lesson plan to be suitable for the students in the classroom which would potentially help them learn better. For example, if a student is confused during class, it is likely that they will not ask for help, leading them to not understand what is going on in the lesson. Having this technology in the classroom, would sense this and modify the lesson so that a student would be able to learn better and understand the topics.  The implications of technology that can detect emotions simply by reading the muscles in the face sound truly remarkable. The thought that one can tell what another is thinking simply by plugging data or maybe even a picture into an algorithm sounds like fiction, but may soon be a reality. The article, \"Making Mona Lisa Smile\" by Nick D'Alto briefly discusses the possible use of such technology in a classroom. The system could examine student's faces, and if they read to be unengaged or uninterested, could adjust the lesson to make learning more interesting to that group of students. That type of technology could revolutionize learning, and customly tailor lesson plans to the feelings of students on any given day.  With the aid of this technology the school can help students before they develope mental illnesses like depression that often go unseen due to hiding true emotion.  The ability for this device to detect the emotions of a student while they are working would be detrimental to the health and responsibilty of the student.  In conclusion, video conferencing and taking online classes with distance learning is not the best thing for students, because of the conflict and problems that come with it. It can greatly affect a student's education. With online classes, students may be faced with distractions which can cause them to stay off task and bring down their grades leading to frustration and depression. This can lead to suicidal thoughts and drain a student's life. Health is very important, and it is necessary that our bodies should be healthy. Taking online courses can have a negative and tragic effect on a student's body leading to eye problems, the eye being a very important body part. This may eventually let the student become unproductive and lazy. Also many students prefer having a face to face teaching session to make learning more efficient and better to understand overall. Students across the world should be able to learn the importance of physically being in school where there's plenty of teachers and resources around. Being in school is very important and can greatly benefit students. Technological advancements in the modern world is also very important and have been beneficial in helping with education and making education better. But students should not let the technology of today make them lazy and they should be willing to work hard and diligently.   \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0   \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 ",

This excerpt from the third source, shows a man's reply to the event Day Without Cars that takes place in Bogota,Colombia once a year. \"'It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,' said businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza.\"(Source 3). This excerpt only furthers my point that less car usage causes people to be more calm and less worried or stressed. \"'When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,' said Heidrun Walter\" (Source 1). This quote from source 1 which discusses a suburb in Germany that is car-free. This blurb shows another example of someone who became happier without a car.  \"It's a good opportuntiy to take away stress and lower air pollution, \"said businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza as he rode a two-seat bicycle wiht his wife\"(Selsky, \"Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota\"). Without cars theres people walking along the side walks talking, people not having to worry about saftey on the road as much, people riding bicycles and skateboarding, and just a great way to excerise just by walking outside. \"The rain hasn't stopped people from participating,' said bogota Mayor Antanas Mockus\"(Selsky, \"Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota\"). The fact that people dont care about the rain makes me think that people are enjoying this car-free day and there's no reason to stop it.  Those who live in car-free communities discover new ways to reach the destinations they have reach throughout the day. Some will utilize their body and take advantage of nature by biking or walking from one place or another. Others might us public transportation or will car-pool with those who do own a car. As previously mentioned before, Colombia participates in a car free day, which means \"Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses\" to get where they needed to be (Selsky). Their use of other means of transportation on the day without cars, exemplifies that it is possible to live using other ways to get around. Some people are against the idea of using other transportation, but if they were to see the impact the alternatives have, they would be more accepting. These days many young people tend to get their license later by waiting until they reach their twenties, suggesting that they can live a happy life without relying on a personal automobile. Instead of using their own cars, they find other ways to get to work or school. These people become acclimated to organizing their lives \"around where they can walk or take public transportation or car-pool with friends\" (Rosenthal). Younger people who commit their lives to walking or public transportation, become aware of the fact that driving a machine that can negatively affect the world is not a necessity. Their awareness then can continue passing on to each generation and can ultimately prevent the excessive use of cars throughout the world.  There's some of us who suffer from stress and anxiety. There's some of us who look at our community and are probably never wanting to go outside again. That is not a community to live in. We deserve to feel relieved, relaxed, and renewed from time to time. In 'Car-Free Day Is Spinning Into a Big Hit in Bogota' by Andrew Selsky, it demonstrates a perfect example. Selsky writes about a \"Car-Free\" day in Bogota, Columbia, and a man shares his side of this event. Carlos Arturo Plaza tells us, \"It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air polluton.\" Selsky writes in paragraph 28 the benefits of this event. He writes, \"Parks and sport centers bloomed... Dramatically cut traffic... New restaurants and shopping districts developed.\" Look what we can accomplish from not using our cars as much.  To further explain, Bogota, Columbia has a program in which people do not use vehicles to get where they need to go. Andrew Selsky states, \"...millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work during a car-free day.. leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams.\" It's a positive thing to have \"car-free day\" because less accidents mean less people getting injured.  Many people throughout the world, would agree that car usage plays a significant role in daily lives. Although some may argue it plays an important role or a not so important role, the limitation of car usuage would be a very helpful thing for everyone, and the world we are surrounded by.  Many believe that automobiles, especially the very popular \"car\", can be very bad for the enviroment. According to the article, \"Paris bans driving due to smog\", it explains how near-record pollution within Paris caused a partial driving ban. This was to help clean the smog infested air in the dense city. Although many delivery companies complained about lost revenue, congestion within the capitcal lowered by 60 percent. By Monday that week, \"the smog cleared enough for the ruling French party to rescind the ban for odd-numbered plates on tuesday\". In another article called \"Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota\", this one tells how Bogota, Columbia has also banned cars to promote alternate transportation and reduce smog. The ban is only for one day a year (called The Day Without Cars), but it's helped cause the construction of 118 miles of bicycle paths, new, smoot sidewalks, less traffic, and new restaurants and shopping areas. Business man, Carlos Plaza claims \"It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution.\"  In the article \"In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars\", by Elisabeth Rosenthal, the author talks about a car-free town, Vauban, Germany.\u00a0Because there are not cars, people are forced to use other forms of transportation. Instead of using cars, mothers and their children walk everywhere, people ride their bikes to the store, and a tram is used to go to downtown Freiburg. Another place where transportation has benefited from a car-free society, is Bogota, Columbia. According to the article \"Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota\", written by Andrew Selsky, since car-free day began, bicycle and pedestrian-friendly areas have been improved. For example, since the 1990s, 118 miles of bicycle paths have been built in Bogota. \"Parks and sports centers have bloomed throughout the city; uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks; rush-hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic; and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up\", writes Selsky. Promotion of other transportation, such as walking, is just one of many benefits of limiting car usage.  In \"Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota\" by Andrew Selsky, improvments to Bogota, Colombia as a result of less car usage is expaned upon. \"The day without cars is part of an improvement campaign that began in Bogota in the mid-1990s. It has seen the construction of 118 miles of bicycle paths, the most of any Latin American city, according to Mockus, the city's mayor. Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city; uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks; rush-hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic; and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have been cropped up.\" Cities are beggining to cater to the needs of those who don't\u00a0 use cars. Their negative impact on city streets is finally being recognized, and many are taking action to improve aspects where they live other than roads. In \"The End of Car Culture\" by Elisabeth Rosenthal, the author discusses the goals of the United States and its major figures to reduce total reliance on cars. In this article Bill Ford, executive chairman of Ford Motor Company shares his hopes. \"He proposed partnering with the telecommunications industry to create cities in which \"pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commerical and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected netowork to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and improve safety.\" Many are striving to make public spaces more accessable to those who choose more concious methods of transport.  In paris they banned cars for a little will because of the pollution making smog. Any one found driving would be fined. Almost 4000 people were fined for driving on that monday and 27 people has their cars impounded for thier reaction. After 5 days the the smog started to leave and they could see beijing, china which are the most polluted citys in the world. In france 67 percent of cars are diesel.  In colombia on car free day people kiked, biked, skated or took the bus on car free day. It was the third start year they had to ban cars to reduce all the smog and people who didnt listen had to pay 25 dollar fine. For the first time other places joined the event to help with the pollution.\" These people are generating a revolutionary change, and this is crossing borders,\".  ",

                "content": "When asking multiple people for advice, you have to keep in mind everyone is different.  For example, when asking your mom, dad, brother or grandpa for their advice on politics, they are all going to have different opinions and answers, and it's the job of the person to make and pick a decision that they personally agree with.  Multiple peoples opinion on something will help the person form a different perspective of a topic.  For example, several people giving the person advice on a topic of something like depression will help them find a different perspective of the topic like the bright side of it or that some people aren't as fortunate.  Everyone is different and people have multiple opinions on a topic or situation which can help them find more than one solution in the decision making process when asking for advice.  For example, if a person has an opinion on a topic, asking multiple people for advice can help them form new and different ideas that they can use to help formulate multiple opinions to help them use in finding a solution for a problem.  Therefore, everyone is different, and when asking for advice, multiple or different views will strengthen your thought and help you think diversely.  If someone who does not know much about the topic is asked, they might not give the best, up-to-date answer. However, someone who is knowledgeable in that specific area will probably be able to connect with the subject and give better advice to help. For example, if someone asks what color the sky is, one person could say it is red, and another person could say that it is purple, but a scientist that was asked could say that it is blue. The scientist would be more educated on this subject. Therefore, they would be able to provide the more helpful answer. If the one asking had only talked to one person, it is more likely that they would get an incorrect answer or a response that is not as beneficial.  The way most people collect this information is through other people. However, it is very common for people to listen to only one persons solution. They believe that you can get a more concise solution by doing this. Although this may be true, getting multiple solutions from multiple people gives you more information on the topic. One example for this would be receiving relationship advice from one friend verses multiple friends. On one side, asking one friend for help may result a good solution to the problem as it is more clear and simple\u00a0and is not as complicated compared to receiving many different answers. On the other side however, getting one solution dose not allow for a compare and contrast of possible solutions through pros and cons, and does not give you all the information about the subject. This example shows that having one solution does not always allow for the best solution because most of the time you are not receiving all the information on the subject and arent able to compare and contrast\u00a0solutions.   The more trials you have in an experiment, the more accurate your results will be. Let's use Generic_Name for an example. If Generic_Name had only listened to Generic_Name, then he would be up to his ankles in empty potato chip bags and energy drinks. It was because he asked multiple pterodactyls, that he was able to get the right advice. This doesn't mean that Generic_Name was planning on being messy or that Generic_Name was trying to scam Generic_Name. They were just trying to be good friends. From a scientific perspective, when planning a science experiment, you would want to have at least three trials. This is because something out of the ordinary could happen in your first trial and that it usually takes at least\u00a0three trials to recognize a pattern in the experiment.  If you are asking for advice - don't pick your favorite person. When I say this I mean people like your parents, your boss, etc. Although they could have good opinions, you might listen to them more than the other people who are trying to give you real feedback. Not only that but you don't want to have a person to lie to you and say that there was nothing wrong with your outfit or that your story didn't have confusing plot lines, when they both do. But on the other side of the feedback spectrum, don't pick someone who is going to crush your spirits. I once had a teacher in 6th grade that inspired me to learn more about the world's history and pushed me to learn. I even considered being a historian when I was older. Then, in 7th grade, I got a 72 year-old teacher who instead of having us learn about the Spanish-American War - stopped the whole class to look at pictures of his grandson. Don't get me wrong, I love looking at adorable picture of babies. But during the year, I lost my love for history and never thought about being a historian since. So what I'm trying to say is that you should pick someone you trust and that you respect and know that they will do the same for you.  For example: When I had difficulty learning a unit in math, I asked multiple friends and got multiple answers that helped me learn it. Asking one person alone can get you answers but asking more people is better because maybe if you ask one, they could be wrong and all the others could be right. For example: I asked my friend the answer to a question, he was wrong but I asked my other friends and they were right. When you are seeking for help try to ask questions. When you ask questions you get right answers. In conclusion, asking questions leads to answers and less questions.  Emotion is in the brain, not the heart. The way the FACS understands emoion is simple. It maps out a 3-D model of the face, looks at the shape and positoin of all the muscles, then it associates the different facial movements with differet emotion. For example, your orbicularis oris (muscles around your mouth) tighten your lips to show when you are angry. It even works when a person it trying to mask emotions. During a fake smile, the zygomatic major stretches the mouth sidways, while in a real smile the zygomatic major lifts the corners of the mouth. These examples can show how science IS able to understand emotoin, probaly better than most humans. Arguments that use that falshood, that science is unable to understand emotion, is completly false.  Each person interprets everything you say differently and think about things differently. for example I was wondering if I should start writing an essay now or wait a little bit and brain storm. I asked my mom and dad what I should do and my mom said that I should think and do a little bit of it now, then later go back check it and do a little bit more. I didn't even think of doing that and it goes to show that asking multiple people can provide new ideas and ways of thinking. According to a philosopher if man gets caught up with work and close his mind to other ways of going about it, he will need someone else to open it for him. this explains that different opinions can help one open their mind to different things and make better decisions  Not all advice given is automatically good. Let's say, for example, you are planning to redecorate your bedroom. Someone offers a neon-yellow pillow for your chair. You think to yourself, no way . Someone else tells you to hang up squares cut out from cardboard around the border of the entrance. You think, huh, that's not such a bad idea , until you ask one more person. They suggest that you declutter your shelf and invest in new curtains for a clean and bright look. Brilliant! The third suggestion is far better than the rest.  Sometimes to recieve good advice, it is all in who you ask, because maybe asking people your age or younger may not be the right people to ask but older people may be the right ones, and vise versa. Here is a good example of asking one person versus many people for advice. When trasforming from child teen, we need advice about what's happening and what to do and what not to do. In this case older people would be the people to ask, because they have been through it and they probably have made the same mistakes as you, therefore that would be their expertise. For younger people you could ask advice on what clothes to pick for school and other easier things that they'd be better at advising you with.  In a classroom environment, teachers can easily explain the questions that students may have through visual demonstration. Take for example, my math class at school; when I have trouble understanding a topic in math, I ask the teacher. She then proceeds to demonstrate an example on the Promethean board, showing all the work and further explaining other questions I have. In an online setting however, students would be restricted to communicating with their teachers through messaging or email. In that scenario, it would be hard for teachers to explain student's questions due to their inability to provide a visual demonstration. Also, students may be in the risk of experiencing loneliness due to the lack of social interaction. Students make most of their friends through school, and by having an online classroom with no face to face interactions, they're missing out on all the friends and memories they could've made. Maintaining a social life and friends is critical for the mental health of children and young adults, and distance learning would only be taking this away from them. Distance learning would not serve to be beneficial to students because of its inability to provide face to face interaction interaction with teachers and their peers. ",

Source #3 claim the following, \" So, other things being equal, a large state gets more attention from presidential candidates in a campaign than a small state does....\" When bigger states have more electoral votes, the candidates will be lead to thinking that if they get the bigger states, for example California who gets 55 electoral votes, to be in their favor then they might have a bigger chance at winning which will have the small states, like Hawaii who only gets 3 electoral votes, thinking that they have no say as to who gets to be their president. This claim is supported by source #3 when it is stated, \"\u00a0 Knowing their vote will have no effect, they have less incentive to pay attention to the campaign than they would have if the president were picked by popular vote\".  There has been times when voters have casted votes for the wrong candidate. The voters know about the presidential candidate not the elector. States often do not get the same level of campaigning as eachother. According to  Slate Magazine a larger state gets more attention from the presidential candidates than a smaller state does. Over 60 percent of citizens who vote would like a direct election instead of the kind we have now, says Bradford Palmer.   According to source 3, \"Knowing their vote will have no effect, they have less incentive to pay attention to the campaign than they would have if the president were picked by popular vote.\" Larger states are paid the most attention to by canidates because they will receive more votes than compared to the number of votes a smaller state would produce. This causes smaller states to have less interest in the campaign because they know they have a lesser chance of their favored canidate winning. Even more, canidates focus on swing states. Swing states are states that can be easily convinced for votes. It is important for all states to focus on the campaign so that an unworthy or unprepared canidate is not chosen for presidency, but only large and swing states are paying attention.  \"It avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of vote cast.\" as stated in the article by Richard Posner. It balances the votes by a larger state compared to a smaller state. In article \"In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to kep our despised method of choosing the President\", the author states that a larger state has more popular votes rather than a small state. The author says this, \"The popular vote was very close in Florida [in 2012]; nevertheless Obama, who won that vote, got 29 electoral votes. A victory by the same margin in Wyoming would net the winner only 3 electoral votes.\" As that being said, the author is explaining how larger states get more attention from a presidential candidates in a campain than a small state does. This is when the Electoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment.  A large state gets more attention than a smaller state does... Is that what we really want in our country  In \"Source 3: In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President\", author Richard A. Posner explains that the Electoral College \"restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment of the Senate decreed in the Constitution.\" The Electoral College gives larger states more attention from presidential candidates as opposed to a smaller state. Posner continues the idea with \"the most thoughtful voters should be the ones to decide the election.\" To break it down, voters who pay close attention to the campaign will be the most thoughtful voters and they will recieve the most attention from the candidates. This reduces the amount of disputes because the presidential candidates will decide on who to give the most attention to.  This would be very unfair to the smaller states for an obvious reason, population. Even though a few states might have a bigger population that doesn't particularly mean that everyone in the state will vote. There are still \"independent voters\". For example, as stated in paragraph twenty-one, the election voting in Florida was very close and relied a lot on popular votes. Florida ended up getting twenty-nine electoral votes, compared to Wyoming who only got three electoral votes. State size does matter because larger states will typically always get more attention from the presidential candidates than smalller ones.  If the president is determined by the most electoral votes, it would make sense that the president would campaign towards larger states with more electoral voters such as California, Texas, and Florida. Why would they spend time trying to appeal to some of the smaller states? This can lead to some states not even seeing the candidate. Infact, during the 2000 election, voters in the 25 largest media markets did not witness any campaign advertising  A Certainty of outcome. It is stated in Source 3 that it is less likely to have a dispute of electoral votes than popular votes. And it's because of the winning candidate's share of popular votes. Everyone's President. It's stated that the Electoral College requires to a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal. The South and Northeast region don't have enough electoral votes to elect a president. So Romney had no incentive of campaining in the South. Swing states. The winner-take-all method is popular in each state in the U.S. Giving the winning candidate to win the presidency. The \"toss-up\" states are more likely to pay more attention to the campaign. 4 Big states. Larger states are more likey to have more electoral votes than smaller states. In contrast, Florida and Wyoming. Florida has 29 and Wyoming with only a mere 3 electoral votes. Avoid run-off elections. The electoral college avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast.  Think of this, you live in Maine, or Hawaii, or somewhere with a smaller population than Florida or California- your state would not have really that much of a impact on who wins the electon. Although, you cannot choose who your state senators in the end vote for, there's a greater chance of your state having a bigger impact. It naturally balences out some of the more heavier politically impacting states. Even though things are equal, in the long run larger states (population wise) will get more attention than states with a smaller population. ",

                "content": "In conclusion, we have established our opinion on why the vote should be changed into a popular vote instead of the Electoral College due to a myriad of concepts, such as the disaster factor in 2000, why swing-states are unfair, the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote, just to reveal the tip of the iceberg in our arguments of understanding why the Electoral College is biased, irrational, and unfair. We have also covered the counterclaims and reasoned them with logic, reality, and true rationality of why the Electoral College shoud be abolished in the vote of the President of the United States of America. So, ask yourself as a state senator, who is truly in the hands of the final say for the President?  Counterclains suggest that because the election depends on the vote of swing states, voters there are more thoughtful and should be the ones to decide how the election goes (Richard A. Posner, source 3).  In Richard A Posners In Defense of the Electoral Collage he states that the Electoral Collage is good because of the \" swing states\" wich he then says \" The voters in toss-up states are more likely to be the most thoughtful voters because they know they are going to decide the election\" in saying this he means that people who live in swing states will be more careful and more thought out on who they want to vote for.  Swing states give America's people a chance to decide an elections outcome.  Look at \"In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President\" Mitt Romney doesn't campaign in the South part of the United States since he knows that he is popular in that region with the electors he doesn't bother camapigning there since he knows he will win their votes. But he has to campaign to other states and regions since he knows the South doesn't have enough power to make him president. And with that comes your swing states and the big states. Swing states listen to what the presidental candidates have to say since they are toss-up states. These swing states literally can \"swing\" the election. These are the states that are going to decide who the next president is. And that ties in with your big states; California, Texas, Florida, New York, and Pennsylvania are some of your big states since they have the most population out of the United States. These states can also be swing states since they have the most votes out of every state. With the power of the popular vote a presidental canidate can become president, and other regions will not have a say. But using the Electoral College that can't happen.  Swing states  In Selection Three, it is said that the swing states (or larger ones) \"... are likely to be the most thoughtful voters, on average (and for the further reason that they will have received the most information and attention from the candidates),\" (paragraph 20).  Selection Two points out something very important that should be stressed, \"... each state casts only one vote, the single representative from Wyoming, representing 5000,000 voters, would have as much say as the 55 represantatives from California, who represnt 35 million votes,\" (paragraph 12). This shows the citizens aren't really being represented properly.  To conclude my previously stated reasons, I believe that having the Electoral College is a crucial part of the system. Because without it the nation would have so many voters that only cast their votes based off of popular opinion. Also without it larger states would have more of an affect on the votes than the smaller states do. Finally, Swing States are a very important part of voting because voters who know what is going on and actually pay attention do have one of the biggest affects.     According to source 3, \"Knowing their vote will have no effect, they have less incentive to pay attention to the campaign than they would have if the president were picked by popular vote.\" Larger states are paid the most attention to by canidates because they will receive more votes than compared to the number of votes a smaller state would produce. This causes smaller states to have less interest in the campaign because they know they have a lesser chance of their favored canidate winning. Even more, canidates focus on swing states. Swing states are states that can be easily convinced for votes. It is important for all states to focus on the campaign so that an unworthy or unprepared canidate is not chosen for presidency, but only large and swing states are paying attention.  This is why swing states are so important to the canditates, they know that the chances of them winning the votes in the other party's states are almost impossible, so they must gather all of the votes they can from the states that are known for their swing-like tendencies. It also goes the other way, each candidate trusts that their own party's states will vote for them, so there is no need to waste the money and campaign. Unless its the primary elections, candidates don't typically campaign where they know that the votes are all but set in stone. It's like going grocery shopping, if you know that you are allergic to peanut butter and you already have all the jam you need, you will only go for the special bread that everybody fights for right? The candidates are the same, they don't go after what they already have and what they can't have, only what they might earn, or else it's just a waste of money, so nobody should be able to complain about a candidates campaigning.

From fixing a car that can't seem to stay fixed to not knowing who to vote for, multiple people giving advice can help a lot. The President of the United States has the cabinet, which is a group of people dedicated to giving the president advice. So, if there's a big problem that needs to get solved and the advice of one person isn't working, try one more person, and if that doesn't work, one more, if that doesn't work, keep going until it does, because there's a high chance that someone can help with whatever the problem is, even if it isn't your inner circle of friends or colleagues, the advice that you need could be close by and you could never even realize it, it could be at multiple points nearby, and you could never even know that several people is what you're looking for. Sometimes, if there's a puzzle with missing pieces, you need to ask multiple people to help solve the puzzle, because they could have the missing pieces in their pockets.  Electoral College is a process that help the United States over many many years. So my question now is, why are you trying to get rid of it? They made so it a vote from Congress would go towards the President and a popular vote from cictizens. Without the Electroal College barely anyone's vote would be heard and Congess would be making our choice for us  I mean yeah some have their facts straight and know how the president they are voting is going to help the united states become a better country overall  Electoral college has helped in many ways. Many people have suggested keeping the electoral college or changing to election by popular vote for the president of United States.  America's government was inspired by the Athenian republic, therefore giving the United States\u00a0 their way of governing today. In a republic government, it is said that the people of the country hold the power of electing their leaders to make decisions for their nation. In the United States of America, the presidential election is held every four years. The eligible citizens in every fifty states are granted the right to vote for their desired president. The process of which these votes are counted is called the Electoral College.  Electing a new president of the United States of America has been, and always will be, a big deal. One could be a state senator, a member of the legislative branch, or even an average citizen with zero involvement in governmental jobs/issues. The one thing that ties all of these people together - is that they're all citizens. As citizens, these people will care about who is running their country, what plans they have for it, and how those plans are carried out. Therefore, on behalf of the U.S., it is important to elect the correct person to rule a nation and keep it safe.  Presidential elections provides the United States of America with an opprotunity of unification. The process of choosing the next leader of the United States always brings the people of the country together knowing that all of them play a role in the election. This is present in the popular vote, a vote consisting of the general population. However, the popular vote is not always accurate, as anyone of any background can vote as long as they hold proper citzenship. The electoral college on the other hand, is a process that serves as a compromise between Congress and the rest of America.  The Electoral College is used in the United States to elect a president, yet it is higly debated over whether it is needed or not. The Electoral College was founded to compromise the election of a president between the people and Congress, to try to avoid problems between both parties. Many people allign themselves with one side to argue that it is needed to eliminate unfair advantages, or that it is not needed because it doesn't give the people the power to elect their president. This brings up disputes and controversy especially in situations that give evidence to support both cases, such as the 2000 presidential election between Al Gore and George Bush.  The United States has ways of being civilaized, and thats by electing leaders. Those leaders that take role of the responsiblitiy are President. Presidents need candidates to vote for them. The only way the President will get elected is by the Electoral College or by popular vote. Although both ways are effective, only one way is the best.  On the other hand, changing to election by popular vote for the president of the United States has some advantages. ",

                "content": "When the idea of the Electoral College was introduced, the telegraph was still pretty hot technology. All votes would be counted by hand by an impartial court, counting off the vote of every single person individually, out of perhaps more than a million voters. Instead of this, each state would record their own numbers and dispatch a group of electors, who could not be influenced away from their vote, while sending a horseman or a few across the hundreds of miles of U.S. territory with a few little scraps of paper with votes on it would be impractical and dangerous. bags could be lost, a rider could have an accident, entire counties would be unaccouted for. The Electoral College was a nessecity as well as a stroke of genius, and I applaud the man who thought of it. However, this was when the telegraph was a stroke of genius, too. Now we have a cell phone the size of a notecard that can store thousands or millions of votes alone. We have processors that can count the number of people that like apples versus oranges and come out with a percentage, verdict, reciept, and the best bussines option as soon as the numbers are input, as soon as we push that little blue \"Enter\" button. We can send the votes through the air in the billions, without as much as wires to conduct them. there is little or no possibility of tampering or miscommunication, and there are records to back up and correct every single little error. it is much smarter, safer, and more accurate to initiate a simple counting program on the computer, with each individual terminal sending all of it's results and information to a higher terminal until all of the information is scored, backed up, double checked, counted, percentaged, and a final verdict is reached. This can even be done in a way to run the information separately to different computers, to minimize tampering.  There is a lot contraversy regarding the Electoral College system of voting in the United States. Some voting members would argue that the system, although flawed, has yet to make a monumental mistake, and say that the minor issues were resolved or at the very least barely effective in the overall outcome of the capmaign. However, with the flaws and holes in the system we have alerady experienced, there is bound to be many more mistakes, and it would be shocking to very few that some of those mistakes are catastrophic  The electoral college was a great idea before computers were invented and all votes had to be counted by hand. When the process of the Electoral College was put into place, it would have been impossible to count he votes of the entire country with any degree of accuracy, and even if it was possible, the validity of votes would be constantly be questioned. But in this day and age technology makes the very idea of the elctoral college obsolete. I understand the desire for preserving traditional methods but not when it sacrifices a fast, fair, easy system.  When voting with a popular vote system a debate over the outcome of the vote is very likely and will probably cause some constroversy. When the votes form the electoral college are counted the margin of victory is much higher which simplifies the result of the poll. During the election of 2012 Obama only recieved 51.3 percent of the vote, however he won the vote of the electoral college with an astounding 61.7 percent, a increase in the margin of victory by 10.4 percent. With this wide of a margin of victory a dispute over the victor of the presidential election is unlikely and\u00a0 almost impossible to argue against.  It is still possible to have a tie though because there are 538 total votes and since that is an even number then it can happen. And if there is just a stlight difference and instead the electoral college creates a landslide then that isn't representing the actuall number of the votes by the people. Once again you are being cheated out of your sya it the election. The hardest thing to understand is why people would still support something that doesn't support them. The electoral college basically throws away your votes and replaces them with theirs. And once again, it is possible for ties in the electoral college due to the even number of votes.  Another critical error is that in the process of the Electoral College is that not all states are equally represented.  By , not making their vote count some people can feel that their voices are not being heard which can lead to in some cases riots and rebellions etc. Voting happens for a reason if gives the world a chance to pick whom they want to see lead them and who they feel like is the right person but in the end if there votes cant count and actually go to the electors limits their power and freedom to speak. '' Voters in presidential elections ae people who want to express a political prefeence rather than people ho think that a single vote may decide an election''.(source 3 , p.23). The Electoral College may have worked in the past but now its not working as well.  The electoral college is a thing of the past, a has been that almost no one wants around. Popular vote elections would be more fair and will not have mistakes during elections like the huge mistakes the electoral college system has proven to display. The citizens of America want the electoral college gone and popular vote elections should be what the government is aiming for so we do not have mistakes in our elections and so the U.S. can benefit from actually having a working election process.       \u00a0       \u00a0     For various reasons the electoral college is unfair such as not everyones decisions count just those few people in the electoral collge.  In conclusion, the Electoral College should be replaced by the popular vote system as soon as possible. The Electoral College relies on archaic methods to make tallying votes simpler for the government, which results in problems. It's like the government is rounding the votes. The winner-takes-all method of the Electoral College can render a voter's vote completely useless, and it even allows representatives to vote for the presidential candidate that is against the voter's wills. Presidential candidates will not bother campaigning in states that are loyal to their adversary or are too small to be worth their time. While a single person's opinion might not seem important, or rounding votes seems \"easier,\" no corners should ever be cut when deciding who the leader of a nation with over 50 million citizens is, which is why the Electoral College should be replaced by the popular vote system.

Thus, the Electoral College is a balance of votes that includes many different sources for which the President is elected  What is electoral college? The electoral college is a process, not a place. the founding fathers established it in the constitution as a compromise between election of the president by a vote in congress and election of the president by a popular vote of qualified citizens. But it is also a bad thing because you help choose your states electors when you vote for president because when you vote for president because when you vote for your canadate you are actually voting for your canadates electors.  The Electoral College is a process not a place. When the founding fathers established it in the Constitution as a compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and also a popular vote of approved citizens.  In many cases there is two sides to an arguement. When there is two sides to an arguement it could go either way. In this case the arguement is about the electoral college. What is the electoral college,it is the the process, not a place. The founding fathers established it in the consitution as a compromise between election of president by a vote in congress and election of presidentby popular vote of qualilfied citizens.(stated in paragraph 1)  \"Do you want to be apart of a Electoral College\"  Electoral colleges. Do you know what this means? An electoral college is a process of multiple facts. Not a place. As everyone thinks Electoral College sounds decieving because the word \"college\" in the name but apparentley thats not true. The founding fathers established it in the constitution as a compromise between election of the President and votes by the people of America. Dear Senator, this is where I begin rambling on and on about how the electoral college is wonderful and great. But I am just going to let you in to alittle bit of knowledge behind the thinking, before you get your fingers in a knot.  Do you know what the Electoral College is? It's a process that the founding fathers established in the Constitution as a compromise between election of President by a vote in Congress and election of President by popular vote of qualified citizens.  Most people hear the word \"Electoral College\" and think that it is a place.. But they're wrong, it is a process. The Electoral College is widely regarded as a thing that seems to belong to the past and not to fit in the present. The advocates whom are conflicting with others are saying that the Electoral College method isn't democratic in modern day society, which is correct. The Electoral College is a compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens which was founded by the founding fathers.  The Electoral College, established by the Founding Fathers within the Constitution, was meant to serve as a compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and a popular vote of citizens. What the founding fathers failed to see was the many outstanding flaws within the Electoral College. For many imperative reasons that cannot be avoided,  \"The founding fathers established it in the Constitution as a compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote.\" (the Office of the Federal Register). People must remember that this system is a compromise for the election and that any change could lead to problems among the government again. The public must also remember that \"each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee\".(Richard A. Posner). This system also can often prevent disputes. \"A dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is possible...but it's less likely than a dispute over the popular vote. The reason is that the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College invariably exceeds his share or the popular vote.\" (Richard A. Posner). Along with the fewer disputes, it also creates standards for the candidate. \" The Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal...This is a desirable result because a candidate with only regional appeal is unlikely to be a successful president.\" (Richard A. Posner). Another benefit to this system is that it causes voters to pay closer attention to the election. \"Voter in toss-up states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign.\" (Richard A. Posner). Along with the more aware voters, the Electoral College is also very beneficial to the big states. \"The Electoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states (by population) lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment of the Senate decreed in the Constitution.\" (Richard A. Posner). And lastly, the Electoral Collee helps avoid run-off elections. \"There is pressure for run-off elections when no candidate wins a majority of the votes cast; that pressure, which would greatly complicate the presidential election process, is reduced by the Electoral College, which invariably produces a clear winner.\" (Richard A. Posner). To sum it all up, there are many benefits to the Electoral College.  The electoral college was established as a compromise between election of the President by congress, and election of the President by popular citizen vote. The founding fathers felt it would given congress too much power if it elected the President all by itself. They also felt if citizens chose the seat by themsleves there wouod be chaos. They decided on a nice in between; they both choose, well sort of. What many citizens do not know is that when they cast their vote, they are not voting for the president, but for a slate of electors who in turn elect the President. ",

                "content": "Leonardo Da Vinci was one of the greatest reniassance painters of the time. His study of the human anatomy allowed him to create pictures that captured the humna state. On of his most well known paintings is the \"Mona Lisa\". The Mona Lisa is a women that has sort of complacent facial features. She doesn't really look happy or sad. This was the popular thought up until a new technology was created. This technology is called the Facial Action Coding System. This technology is able to deduce what emotion a person is feeling. It is able to do this whothout the person even showing an obvious emotion. This technology can also be implenmented in many spheres of life, including in the classroom.  According to the article \"Making Mona Lisa Smile,\" there is a new technology called the Facial Action Coding System (FACS) that enables computers to identify human emotions. This technology is relatively brand new. It creates a 3-D computer model of all fourty-four major muscles in the face that move like human muscles as well. Then, psychologists have classified six basic emotions that are associated with different movements in the facial mucles. This new technology could result in many benefits in our community as well as all around the world  Slip into a world where emotions are easily read. There could be no mind games, no pettiness, and no suffering in silence;this could be the new reality. In the article \"Making Mona Lisa Smile\" by Nick D'Alto, he introduces a new concept created by Thomas Haung:Facial Action Coding System software. This programming system allows computers to register all of the emotions on an individual's face, reguardless if they are mixed.  The implications of technology that can detect emotions simply by reading the muscles in the face sound truly remarkable. The thought that one can tell what another is thinking simply by plugging data or maybe even a picture into an algorithm sounds like fiction, but may soon be a reality. The article, \"Making Mona Lisa Smile\" by Nick D'Alto briefly discusses the possible use of such technology in a classroom. The system could examine student's faces, and if they read to be unengaged or uninterested, could adjust the lesson to make learning more interesting to that group of students. That type of technology could revolutionize learning, and customly tailor lesson plans to the feelings of students on any given day.  Students may also use this feature in art classes to really capture what the artist was depicting in the work. For instance, this new software was able to create percentages of Mona Lisa's emotions. The latest innovation in computer software may be very useful for art classes, knowing how a person may be feeling in a painting may help students to depict the artists work, a bit better. As humans, we can tell how someone may be feeling by the look on their face, or the look in their eyes. Most of us would have trouble trying to describe what facial expressions convey being happy, besides a smile. The computer can make exact percentages on each emotion you may be feeling.  In the sixth paragraph of the article \"Making Mona Lisa Smile,\" the author illuminates the possibilites of success human-emotion-recognizing computer software provides in terms the world of marketing, describing how analyzing the emotional response to a Web ad popping up on one's computer screen can mold the variety of its future ads to a more preferred selection (6).  In the article \"Making Mona Lisa Smile,\" the author explains how certain algorithms built into a system, called the Facial Action Coding System, can detect human emotions. In the article, the author describes how a classroom computer can recognize when a student is getting bored or confused based on their facial expressions. This computer can change the way that the lesson is being taught so that the students are more productive in classes.  In the article,\"Making Mona Lisa Smile\" by Nick D'Alto, it describes how the system can regognize how a student is feeling. The lesson changes depending on how the system reads the student's reaction. The system can read when a student is bored and change up the lesson. This is essential because it allows students to be more engaged in learning, since it will no longer be as boring as it was for them. The system may also help students to remain engaged in learning because nobody would be learning something the same exact way. In the article it says that lessons are modified to fit every student using facial recognition, so students would be learning in a way that suites them personally. This technology also keeps students more engaged because they would feel happier, because the system tries to keep students engaged and happy. In the article it says that the system can ready when people are unhappy, so the system would try to prevent students from feeling that way about learning. The system could really help students be more excited about learning.   The article states that the technology associates each emotion with \"characteristic movements of the facial muscles\" and then uses those movements to calculate the spectrum of emotions based on their facial display. But some people show emotions in various ways, and the technology most likely cannot accomodate for the many different ways people express the same emotion. For example, if a student has a resting face that seems generally happy, the system might confuse this dazed face as a satisfied face and think that the student is happy with their lessons when they are actually confused or not paying attention. In the same way, if a student has a resting face that looks naturally sad, the system may think they are unhappy with their lessons, even if the student feels they are learning a lot. A lot of students also try to hide their emotions, like frusteration or sadness, with a happier look on their face, and even though the article states that the system can detect a \"false smile\", it cannot always be accurate as a person may be good at hiding their emotions and displaying a genuine smile. Therefore, since technology is not always accurate and because human beings are so various in the way they behave, the technology would not be useful in a classroom where it may misread a student's state of mind and lead them in the wrong path of education.  Like in \"Making Mona Lisa Smile\" by Nick D'Alto, it could be used to show when a kid is becoming bored and let the teacher know so that the instructor could switch the lesson up to grab the kid's attention ",

                "content": "Some people like to play basketball, some like to play hockey, some like to play football. Likewise, students all have different sets of skills and things that they enjoy. Some students may want to do something that is not offered at that school, yet they wouldn't be able to. It doesn't make sense that they should participate in something that they don't enjoy. If a person who does not like to play sports is forced to play an after school sport, that would unfair towards them. Or, if a person who only likes to draw has to take an extracurricular activity, what would they do if there isn't an art club? Making the students do something they would not like or they're not interested in is not very fair.  Sometimes people are busy all the time, like, people that do sports after school, some of them don't get out of there sports practice or games after sometime, mostly around 9:00pm. Personally, people are great for doing after school activities, but I'm not one of those people, and I will never be, unless its something with basketball, or an activity that I'd want to do on my free time, but it usually waists a lot of free time, and I'm one of those people that like to do homework, especially since I get a lot of it. So what I'm trying to say is, we have a life too, were not always just on our technology 24/7, were actually trying to do things that are good for us.  but some students do not want to do it and some have sports or other things to worry about and i just think it could cause so much stress to students.  There are some students that just don't like the idea of doing extra work when it's not required. It's not necessarily that they're lazy, but they just dont see the importance of going out of their way to do something that they can't see the immediate benefits to. Enforcing the change could arouse\u00a0some anger in a vast majority of students, and possibly parents, but if the students are given an option to not participate in an extracurricular activity, things would most likely run a lot smoother. Most people would call these types of kids, \"average\" due to the fact that they settle for the amount of work given, and typically don't want to exceed expectations. Perhaps making them participate in beneficial activities wouldn't hurt, they just need to be a little more open minded to the idea at hand.  Say for example my school only offers basketball ,track and cheer leading\u00a0,but I really want to do soft ball that could be forcing me too do a sport I would not like to do . For another example say your school offers languages for and extracurricular activity like french and Spanish but he/she wanted to learn another language that would be be hard for me because maybe I only wanted learn language. That's another reason why I do disagree with making people do extracurricular activities.  Do you think every\u00a0body should do a extra curricular activity? Most people do activities but the school does not run them. A lot\u00a0of schools dont even host good our a lot\u00a0of programs. Most activities do not fit every body. After school things separate more time away from peoples family.  If someone makes the team for a sport over a kid who wants it more then that person. The student that made it gets forced to do something\u00a0he docent want to do, and ruins opportunities for other kids.  Students should not be forced to participate in an extracurricular activity because some may not be interested and may not have a means of transportation. A student may also have trouble balancing out extracurricular work and school work. Though at the end of the day, everyone has his or her own purpose in life. It may be to do big things or some may want to do small things. It is not fair to be forced to do something that an individual may not want to do. Students have the right to choose their own path in life and to express themselves as they please.   \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  Some students have trouble socializing with others. So maybe they didn't apply for an activity because they just didn't want too. Some students also enjoy their free time, time where they can do homework, be on their electronic devices, or just take a nap. So they didn't want to do an extracurricular activity because they didn't want to give up their free time. Students shouldn't have to feel like they are forced to do something. I mean it is called extracurricular activity for a reason, because it's for extra credit, so it shouldn't be a mandatory thing that they have to do.  Participating in clubs or groups are not for everybody. If a student does not desire to participate in an extracurricular activity, he or she should not have to. If the student is forced to, he or she may not do any work. For example, a student was forced to participate in an after school club. During the club, the student would talk out and misbehave. The student was disrespectful to the club leader and acted in a disorderly manner. When asked, the student replied, \"I was forced to be here.\" If students are required to participate in an extracurricular activity, a student may not do any work out of a lack of interest.  You can tell them that not all after school activities are sports related, and so instead of making your kids play sports try letting them pick what they want to do. There are so many good clubs and organizations to join in school so why not take advantage of it? For example you could join the yearbook committee or join student council, there are so many options we could keep going forever. Now what if your child does not like any of the extracurricular activities? Schools are great places to try new things, just because your child has never done something before does not mean they won't necessarily like it. So before you jump the gun and say you child does not like something maybe let them explore their options first. ",

The belief that the mesa is actually a face is inncorect due to evidence in the article and my essay. Mesa's are common in the area the picture was taken and the face was caused by shadows along with a low quality camera. Whichever side you are on I believe I have brought forth enough evidence to change your opinion or strengthen your opionion that there was no alien lifeforms yet found on Mars.  I'm a scientist at NASA and the Face, a lot of people seem to think was formed by aliens or is proof of alien life forms, is actually just a natural landform  The author states that scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa when the face appeared. This shows that they have seen things like this before and they knew that it wasn't real, or alien like. Another example that the author proves is that Garvin said it reminded him of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. The camera on board MGS had to peer through wispy clouds to see the face and perhaps alien markings were hidden by haze. Also NASA can be hidding information about the Face. But, you can see that the Face is formed by shadows, and not an alien haze.  In conclusion, the face is just a natural landform. It may look like a head, but that is just because of the unusual shadows that the mesa has. If my co-workers and I thought this was actually proof of alien life, why would we hide it from you? What is the point in hiding that kind of information?  In conclusion, some people may think there is alien life on Mars because of past picture or conspiracy theories. No one can denty however, that NASA has proven the Face to be nothing but a natural landform on the Red Planet Mars. NASA has proven this by recent pictures, scientific evidence, and real-life examples and measurements. Over the years, NASA has worked hard to figure out the mystery of the face, and just recently they have discovered, with pictyures, evidence, and measruements, that the Face is just a natural landform with unusual shadowing formed on the Red Planet Mars.  The \"face\" isn't any perticular shape that any man or alien would want. The landform would be shaped as a circle, square or any other simple shape, and it would not be so ridgid and cracked. If you were to look at the photo furthest to the left, you would assume that it resembled a face, but If you compair that photo to the one taken twenty-five years later, you would begin to understand that to photo was out-dated and that the camera was not as clear as the one taken later. In addition, why would an alien make a structure of a human's face.   Contrary to popular belief, there is nothing unatural about the supposed \"Face on Mars\". Though many would like to believe in the supernatural, this oddity is nothing but a rock formation. There are several reasons as to why the theory of aliens making this formation is preposterous, each reason stronger than the previous.  After scientists did a little research on their own, \"The Face\" turned out to actually be a messa that is common around the american west.  It does look like it could be from another living organism, but it's just a rock on the planet. In our newest image of the rock, it turns out that the face has dissapered. There is no evidence of this being created by aliens, rather it was created by wind and water that has been found on Mars. The reason you might believe that this was indeed aliens, might be the fact that the news has blown it out of poportion. It's just the rock that had some interesting shadows and holes that made it look like a human face.  Even thoug hmy colleague still believes in the \"Face on Mars\" to be a alien made structure. I still believe it's only a butte or mesa. With my evindence of the \"Face on Mars\" only looking like a face due to the techonology of the time, the shadows of the sun, the angle the picture was taken, and our ability to see faces when none are there, I believe I have conclusive evidence that the \"Face on Mars is nothing but a butte or mesa.

When I get home, I have a substantial amount of homework to do, and I have to practice the sports I play. My schedule is already full. homework takes me the longest to do. I work on my homework thoroughly. I try to make sure there isn't any mistakes. When I do this, I'm more likely to pass the test because of how much thought and time I have put into my work. I describe this as my work ethic. My homework takes me about two to four hours at most and it takes up most of my schedule. The sports that I play take two hours. With a total of seven hours at most, I can never seem to fit anything else in my schedule. This might be surprising for other people but this is the daily schedule for average students and most students might have more to do. If we even tried to do an extra activity than we wouldn't be able to finish all of our work efficiently and properly. Adding another thing to do every day would throw off our work ethic and our grades would most likely go down. Time has such a drastic effect on us students because it can be hard to manage. Our parents, for example, suffer from time management along with us. If we all do an extra activity, then that means that school is extended another few minutes. This is hard for our parents who pick us up after school. They have to find another time to pick us up which can be stressful since their schedule is as cramp as ours. We are not able to participate in an extra curriculum because of the amount of time that we don't have, and even if we were able to, there might not be any other options.  You should really consider these possibilities for the students future and how it would impact them when they go to collage, get a job, and have a family. I think you should only have people who have D's or below to not be able to play sports, but let the people who have a C and up be able to play sports. Just remember these ideas and how it could impact the future of those students and how they will live the rest of there lives wonder how to play that sport and teach there kid to learn that sport, but they wouldn't be able to do that if you do not change the grades to have them play sports cause of a grade rule that you put up. So let those kids with a C average play sports.  These students need to be prepared for college and the real world outside of school, such as the work force. For example, if a child wanted to play soccer you would not just sit them in front of a television and watch soccer games. This might be a good way to teach them the general idea of what soccer is but they will never be able to learn the skills that are necessary in the game. That child will never learn how to pass, shoot, kick, or even have the social skills to communicate with his team mates. This goes the same for any other activity. The teachers in this school are treating there students just like this child. If they just give them the summer project and tell them to complete it they will never learn the skills of self-management and creativity that they would develop while design their own summer projects. These are valuable skills that students will need later in their own life time.  This helps them to have a \"C\" or higher and they can apply what they learn on the field to when they'er off the field. A student in my class is always asking for his absent work because he has to leave early for one of his games. This student doesn't play just one sport but 3. So when he comes back the next day he has to make up all of his work if he wants to stay on the team. An example of applying what student learn on the field to off the field is my friend that plays football. He said to me \"I could never make a touch down if some one wasn't covering my blind side\",then he said, \"It's not about if  I win because  I would\u00a0have never maid it if there was no one on the team to cover me.\" Then the next day at his game he maid sure that the crowds were celebrating him and the team when they won.  Children are much more likely to be passionate about their own projects if they feel as if it is uniquely their own. The research and skills would go in to more depth with more focus, for example, if I got to write about what I had learned in Florence and Rome instead of doing mindless work. Anyone is much more likely to benefit and learn from something they love and enjoy. It is also more likely for the kid to retain the information better if they have some sort of association to it, like research about a place they went or sport they participated in. Teachers would have students returning back to school with project in their hands that they are excited to share with their peers.  Some people like to play basketball, some like to play hockey, some like to play football. Likewise, students all have different sets of skills and things that they enjoy. Some students may want to do something that is not offered at that school, yet they wouldn't be able to. It doesn't make sense that they should participate in something that they don't enjoy. If a person who does not like to play sports is forced to play an after school sport, that would unfair towards them. Or, if a person who only likes to draw has to take an extracurricular activity, what would they do if there isn't an art club? Making the students do something they would not like or they're not interested in is not very fair.  The sports activities should be earned by putting forth best effort in your education. If students like sports and extracurricular activities, then they should think more about what they must do to participate in them. students need to think about their options first. Its sort of like cause an effect. If students get lower than a B average then it effects their chances of participating in extracurricular activities. Students must think about the consequences of their own mistakes. Just like many famous people today who act in movies and on television, they also had to work hard. I hard work is put into what you are trying to pursue then it can be accomplished or obtained. You just have to earn it. No one is just given anything in life. Those people earn what they have.  If students are not focusing on their work and only on sports and other extra activities, then they are defeating the purpose of school.  Students who have a grade average of a C should focus more on learning in school before they worry about playing sports or joining other clubs at the school.  If the policy was changed so that students could only participate in sports or other activities if they had a grade average of a B or higher, then you would insure that they were coming to school and learning and staying on track to becoming successful later in their lives, not just coming to school to play sports or participate in extra-curricular activities.  Some students may be very good in a certain thing, such as writing stories, or sculpting, or some other talent that isn't very popular. This then leads to them having nowhere to go, leaving them with something they don't enjoy. If the school doesn't have a club or activity that suits them, then they shouldn't have to participate in one. If they do, it's just extra work that'll bore them. Clubs are supposed to be enjoyable, and help students find others that have the same interests as them, but if participating in a club or activity is mandatory, students may feel left out, and not included. They may be excluded and picked on for having a talent that others can't relate to,or be picked on for not being good at something.  Five day school weeks with consistent schedules provide students with some sort of structure to their education. Without a schedule assisting students with time management, they become accountable for their own learning. This is an issue because most adolescents don't have a passion for knowledge or simply do not know why they have to go to school which makes it difficult to invest their time into something they do not really want to do. For example, I am passionate about lacrosse. I am willing and able to invest consistent time and effort into improving my stick skills, strength, and endurance. With school, on the other hand, I find it difficult to invest the same amount of time and effort into a class or specific assignment I simply don't have that much interest in. It is not until I am forced to complete an assignment by a due date, or study for an upcoming assessment that I put in the effort necessary to succeed. However, with a structured number of hours that I must attend school each week, I am forced to absorb the knowledge required to eventually complete the work due in my classes. Most students who are not super passionate about school would much likelier not pay attention in an online class, or not even attend altogether. Online sessions will be ineffective on student participation, leading students to a lower quality of learning or even complete lack of education. It is completely dependent on the student's thirst for knowledge, which may not be that important to them. ",

                "content": "The Challenge of Exploring Venus\" is an article about the positives and negatives of trying to land a spacecraft on Venus. He has a decent build-up into his first point while giving more and more small facts about our second planet.  In \"The Challenge of Exploring Venus,\" the author supports the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents  Overall, the author of \"The Challenge of Exploring Venus\" makes a claim that although Venus has some exceptionally dangerous conditions, it is a planet worth exploring. They support this claim very well by explaining the importance of going to Venus, and providing a few solutions that might reduce the risk factor of this type of mission. All in all, this author, much like Audrey Hepburn, proves through this article that they feel that nothing is truly impossible, not even a trip to Venus.  In conclusion, the author of \"The Challenge of Exploring Venus\" demonstrates how despite the dangers Venus presents, it is worthy of pursuing. Exploring venus seems like it is almost impossible with all the risks it offers, but the author makes it clear in this article that they disagree. Their use of evidence in their writing to support their belief that Venus is a worthy pursuit shows how well researched their case is. The author used evidence on Venus's relationship to Earth, how landing on Venus is possible, and the natural curiosity humans have to support their idea. After taking a look at this article, readers know that the points made in \"The Challenge of Exploring Venus\" were very nicely supported. The author's support made their idea a thought provoking case.  In \"The Challenge of Exploring Venus\", the author argues the point that exploring Venus is worth the effort and risks exhibited. The author claims that, despite the harsh conditions and deadly atmosphere, this planet is worth travelling to and observing, due to its being the \"nearest option for a planetary visit\".  In \"The Challenge of Exploring Venus,\" the author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit depsite the dangers it presents. The author uses strong details to support this claim throughout the article. Facts and statistics by NASA and other reliable sources are used to back the claims. The author stands by the opinion that Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents.  In \"The Challenge of Exploring Venus\" the author supports Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presnts through his analysis of hovering, silicon carbide, and mechanical computers. He supports his ideas with evidence and also the analysis he has with his knowledge by research. He uses facts, and not a lot of opinions to express his ideas and belief that Venus is a worthy pursuit. He colcudes his argument that humanity's travels on Earth and beyond should never even be limited by threats of dangers or doubts. Without that, knowledge will be expanded and fuel the innovation of the human world and beyond.  Venus is a challenge to get to with its hot surface, with its thick atmosphere, and atmospheric pressure. But scientists and astronomers are facinated by Venus, because they believe it had oceans and could have supported various forms of life.  In \"The Challenge of Exploring Venus,\" the author describes why putting a man on the moon seems like a walk in the park compared to the horrendous obstacles preventing humans from pushing the frontier with visiting one of Earth's neighbors, Venus. The thick atmosphere is toxic to us. The clouds of sulfuric acid, the incredibly high temperatures on the planet's surface, and pressure would present challenges to mankind and its technology.  In the article he writes \" Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere.\" Again he is describing Venus to sound like an awful place, so why would you want to explore it. Another good claim he makes is that, \"since no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours.\"  Why would you go explore Venus in a space craft if all of them were destroyed. If it where me i would not want to explore Venus, the author has given me plenty of reasons not to. ",

        "query": "It keeps a steady stream when it comes time to vote because aslong as someone had 270 votes you know thats who will get picked. so why try changing that and have a whole new system put in and then not know what to do when it comes time to vote. And what if the new system dosent work, what if the new way of the voting process messes with the tallys and they come out wrong and no one will get picked, unlike the other way when u know everything will come out right and u know that we will have a president. I think its fair that they have it set at 270 for voting that way everyone havs a chance to vote instead of it being so low that only a few people get to vote before they shut it down because they have reached there number of tallys that they need.\u00a0 So if they change the number of tallys that a president needs to become president that will be stupid and people will act out on it because they wont think its right, and because the people who didnt vote will not like the fact that they didnt get to put there vote f in before they stoped the voting and because they meet the number that they needed. Its a vote why do they need to title it as a the vote of a president or a popular vote of a president. Why not just vote for there just electors instead of saying vote for your candidate when really you are just voting for the electors. If you are voting for a certin thing there is no reason that u have to re-word it just to vote, if you are voting for something do it the right way instead of changing stuff and making it seem one way when really its the other way. Why should the electoral get just as much as the winning presindent? They are not doing as much as the president\u00a0 and who is helping him out.. so they should not get the same reword.    ",

                "content": "According to source 3, \"Knowing their vote will have no effect, they have less incentive to pay attention to the campaign than they would have if the president were picked by popular vote.\" Larger states are paid the most attention to by canidates because they will receive more votes than compared to the number of votes a smaller state would produce. This causes smaller states to have less interest in the campaign because they know they have a lesser chance of their favored canidate winning. Even more, canidates focus on swing states. Swing states are states that can be easily convinced for votes. It is important for all states to focus on the campaign so that an unworthy or unprepared canidate is not chosen for presidency, but only large and swing states are paying attention.  In source three, Posner states \"it is the electors who elect the president, not the people.\"If one has gone through an election, theres a long process and hassle of being able to vote, but if people go through the craziness to vote, why not make the vote count?\"\"Faithless\" electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please.\"(Plumer, paragraph 11). Not only are voters wasting their time to vote but the electors cheat. For example, if one candidate has the urge to win, they will send one of their electors to be on the opponents side so the opponent loses a vote that they believed would be theres. Electoral College also may not be fair to those in a small state. \"a large state gets more attention from presidential canidates in a campaign than a small state does...\", as said by Posner. Its not fair that even the people who vote from a small state, won't really get recognized because there are bigger states to overrule, and even then, the electors will still choose who they desire. Electoral College is an unfair, and a cheating way to vote.  If someone were to ask one hundred different people what their favorite food is, they would probably get 100 different answers. This can be applied to advice because, if someone were to ask several different people for advice, they could get completely different advice from different people, and, chances are, some of the advice can really help instead of giving the person that needs advice useless information floating around. For a moment, imagine that it's time to vote for the President, and person 1 has no idea of who to vote for.  So person one goes back to his/her good friend person 2, then asks, \"Person two, who are you voting for?\" Person two replies with his/her chosen candidate, and person one asks several other people, and finally, person four tells person one about the candidate that he/she has chosen, and person one also votes for that person, because from what person four said, that person will do great things as President. If person one had just asked person two who to vote for, he/she never would've known that person four had chosen the candidate that was right for person one's beliefs. Another benefit to getting multiple people's solutions is that the different advice can be applied to the same problem until something works. For example, person one is trying to fix that pesky flat tire on his/her car, and then the advice that person two and person three gave. Because person one can't get person four to help, because person four is on vacation in Norway, person one decides to apply the advice of person two and person three to see if something works, and it turns out that person two had good advice once person one figured out what person two was trying to say. Basically, multiple answers can lead to the best answer and many solutions can be applied to the same problem until something works.  It has this ability, because to be a tie both canidates have to have 269 votes which is highly unlikly. To have a President chossen majority has to vote one way (270). Now with a \"winner-takes-all\" system that his country, USA, has, there are only so many combinations of states' votes for one party that there would be a tie. Since the beggening of the Electoral College there has only been two ties. The Electoral College does make it easier for there not to be a tie, because more people voting into selected individuals then having them vote makes it easier for less mess ups and faster counting of votes.  If I had a choice between keeping the Electoral College or a popular Vote, I would pick a popular vote cause the Electoral College is pretty crashed and it really fair. I say give people a chance and let them vote.\u00a0 Picking a pedigree plurality of votes from the Electoral College then from the Popular votes isnt fair based on us. No voters vote swings a national election,and in spite of that,about one-half the eligible American population did vote in the election of 2012,as said in pharagraph 23. I think that Voting for the popular vote would be better then Electoral College cause it would be the states vote instead of just a majority of peoples vote that only want a president that is not validated for success for us.  This might lead the small states to not vote because they feeel that they would not make a difference. Source #3 claim the following, \" So, other things being equal, a large state gets more attention from presidential candidates in a campaign than a small state does....\" When bigger states have more electoral votes, the candidates will be lead to thinking that if they get the bigger states, for example California who gets 55 electoral votes, to be in their favor then they might have a bigger chance at winning which will have the small states, like Hawaii who only gets 3 electoral votes, thinking that they have no say as to who gets to be their president. This claim is supported by source #3 when it is stated, \"\u00a0 Knowing their vote will have no effect, they have less incentive to pay attention to the campaign than they would have if the president were picked by popular vote\".  In Source 2, paragraph 12 it states, \"Perhaps most worrying is the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote.\" This is a big worry because the electoral college holds a total of 538 votes which is definetely possible to cause a tie. If this were to happen, then the vote would be thrown to the House of Representatives where state delegations would vote on the president. Then the concept of the presidential campaigns would become pointless because the point of campaining is to try to win over large, swing states to ensure more votes. Because the bigger the states population, the more votes they hold in the electoral college. But that would only work if it was in the Senates hands because the amount of representatives in the Senate for each state is based off of population, whereas the amount of representatives in the House of Representatives is always two for each state. So if the vote was thrown into the House of Representatives hands, then whichever candidate who holds claim over the most states, regardless of size, would almost automatically win the election because each state holds equal say in their vote.  As stated in the third article, paragraph 20, \"The winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes induces the candidates... to focus their campaign effors on the toss-up states.\" As you know, toss-up state's make the final vote. Therefore, people in these states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign, and they will be the ones with the most information. If it were up to popular vote, then anyone over the age of 18 could randomly pick a winner. Let's be honest, the majority of eighteen year old's will vote on whoever their friends or family vote for, or even the candidate representing their group (Democratic or Republic). Many people, if the president was decided by popular vote, would make an uneducated decision on one of the canidates, not studying their choices as much as one would with the Electoral College system in place.  Chossing your president is something very important and we need a way , a method to help us pick the right one. The Electoral College is the best way of picking the right president and doing it right. If you pick your president by a popular vote it would only lead to a disaster. In our world we need a method like this one that will guide us to make the right desion and something as imporatant as our President, well we can just pick out of anything we have to do it\u00a0 wise and neat so the right choice is picked  Everyone would get to put in their opinion on who should be the president of the United States. I think that if everyone was to be able to individually vote for their president, there would be less chaos and arguements about the election and also the new president.\u00a0But,\u00a0it is possible that the winner of the electoral vote won't win the national popular vote. But, it is very rare. Some people don't bother voting because of the fact that their vote will have no effect. They have less incentive to pay attention to the campaign than they would have if the president were picked by popular vote. ",

                "content": "The electoral college imposes on the American freedom and right to choose their president. The United States of America is a representative democracy. The citizens choose who they want to lead but those votes aren't truly their own votes. According to Richard A. Posner of source 3, \"...the Electoral College method is not democratic in a modern sense...it is the electors who elect the president, not the people. When you vote for a presidental candidate, you're actually voting for a slate of electors.\" American citizen votes do not matter as much as we think they should. The founding fathers built this country for the people. The people should have an actual voice in who they want to lead this great nation. In addition, Americans should have a direct say. Votes should go straight to the president and not the party's electors. This is not only fair to citizens but also a more relible plan. Bradford Plumer of source 2 explains to us that \"\"faithless\" electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please...\" We can't depend on these electors to determine one of the most important things of this country. We can't depend on these \"faithless\" electors to vote who we want when they might do the opposite. Voting by popular vote prevents these mishaps and restores our democracy.  People in the United states have a voice of opinion towards voting,but in the end it is the electoral college that has the final say. To many americans voting is a very important event. The united states is a democracy. A democracy is a form of government where people have the say, The United States does not follow that route because of electoral college. Senator of the United States,  America's government was inspired by the Athenian republic, therefore giving the United States\u00a0 their way of governing today. In a republic government, it is said that the people of the country hold the power of electing their leaders to make decisions for their nation. In the United States of America, the presidential election is held every four years. The eligible citizens in every fifty states are granted the right to vote for their desired president. The process of which these votes are counted is called the Electoral College.  In conclusion Senate, Citizens of this country and I believe that we should put an end to the electoral college. Politicians even disagree with the idea of giving specific people to give the final vote. As senator you have the power to put a end to this unconstitutional doing. The United States is a democracy where everyone matters. Because of the electoral college our opinion on who should be elected has been taking away from us. this event is undemocratic and I ask you senator to think this through and take action on making this voting system to a popular voting system  In Source 3 Posner states, \"it is the electors who elect the president, not the people\". Ever since the United States has been around our lifestyle has been purely democratic. The people are supposed to the empowering body of our government and their voice is the one that should be heard. But since we have the Electoral College the voice of the people has become muffled. No longer is the presidential election a democratic event, but one that is decided through the votes of only a few chosen American citizens. Plumer observed in Source 2 that, \"During the 2000 campaign, 17 states didn't see the canidates at all\". If the people of America are truly part of our governing body then they must see the canidates and hear what they have to say. The Electoral College has driven canidates away from states that will not have much say. These states are then left to make a decision for themselves and decide based on their personal preference, they are never able to truly hear what these canidates may or may not have to offer.  In his article, \"The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong,\" Bradford Plumer specifically states that the people themselves do not vote for their desired candidate, but instead, they vote for electors who then vote for the more popular presidential candidate. The people should be the ones who vote for the president because they will be the ones who are governed by the president. The Electoral College gives no voice to the people and is considered by many to be a non-democratic way of voting and is often referred to anachronism. Today, it is a struggle to encourage people to vote and be present on election day because no one feels like their vote matters. People say that one vote doesn't make a difference and that there is no point in filling out a ballot if it has no real affect on which candidate is chosen. The Electoral College and the process it established is really just confirming these opinions. People do not feel like they are contributing because when it comes down to it, the electoral votes are the deciding votes. The Electoral College only has a little over five hundred electors that are representing the millions of regular people who show up at the polls on election day. In order to make the people feel like their opinions are being voiced and their voice is being heard, and to increase voter turnout on election day, it is imperative that the country switches over to election by popular vote.   With over 300 million people now in the United States, under a unified country that promotes and exemplifies democracy, we have not been democratic in the sense that peoples vote doesnt even go to their president, only to another mind that can cast you away as if you were not important. As stated in Par. 7 Source 1 an article by the Office of the Federal Register \"Most states have a winner-take-all system that awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate.\" These are the minds that are sometimes chosen at random, or by other factors to represent you, a choice you werent allowed to make. The winner takes all method only takes away from states like Texas and California who know their vote doesnt matter because these people will always agree on democratic or republican, and what is currently used in our society. This damages thousands of voices, thousands of votes that could have matter, but seemingly don't. Just like\u00a0 how schools have implemented the 'No Child Left Behind' policy, we should transcribe this to leaving no american citizen without a voice, only dependant on what state their in.  In conclusion, the popular voting method should be applied as the designated process of electing the United States President because it guarantees a direct vote towards a desired candidate of your choice. As our country is listed as a democracy, the votes towards the President should lie in the hands of the people. The electoral college is prone to many more problems and is a more complex method of voting. With votes in the hands of the people, voters can get a full \" hands on\" voting experience. As to not repeat myself, in this way voters can really understand the voting system and get the idea in their head their vote is going towards their chosen candidate. Popular voting has not only been proven to be the more preferred method of voting, but in my opinion, shall be the established method of voting to use in the future elections.    It is more liberating than a dictatorship or monarchy in which people are governed by a higher class, which is more often than not decided by someone other than themselves. In a democracy however, people are given the ability to put who they desire in office. They have the ability to be governed by the person of their choice. This, however, is impeded upon by the electoral college. Because what it does is simply insert a middle man into an otherwise democratic society. We are forced to rely on people we elect to vote for us. Which is irrational as it is completely unecessary. The extra step only sets us up for deception and betrayal. I mean why would you trust a man on the street to cast a vote for you when doing so yourself is much more reliable?  Every 4 years, many people vote for a president they think will lead the United States to greatness; some, however, don't know that they are voting for the Electoral College to vote on their choise. This act of using the Electoral College is, by definition, not democratic. Didn't our founding fathers create this country promising democracy and people representation? They did, and that is why the Electoral College must crumble. ",

The world was full of unfairness and was my job, everybody's job, to help stop it. I stepped up to do my part by joining the Seagoing Cowboys. Do your part. Join the Seagoing Cowboys program today. Make the world a better place, one cow at a time.  the seagoing Cowboys program is a very helpful thing, and it woul;d be wonderful if you joined. We always like a little extra muscle. It really is awesome to go sightseeing, get tours of famous places, and see all the tourist attractions that you wouldn't even have a small chance at seeing if you weren't a seagoing Cowboys. Please join us, and have some fun while your at it.  I loved the opportunity to become a seagoing cowboy, even if it was for a short period of time. I was able to learn animal body language and more about how to take care of the animals. I was able to see many great things like the castle in Crete and the Panama Canal. I also learned about culture in many other countries and some of the hardships of living there. The trips made me more aware of the hardships every person in other countries face every, single day of their lives. I hope that all of these reasons convinced you to become a seagoing cowboy.      You should become a Seagoing Cowboy for sure! If you like animals and travling this is the job for you! You can have so much adventure you would'nt even know what to do with it! This generation needs to carry on with the Seagoing Cowboys! To help animals and more! One day we will need your help more than ever! We need this to keep going with the Seagoing Cowboys! He even know himself it was an opportunity of a lifetime.         You will get to help others in need if you become a Seagoing Cowboy.  The Seagoing Cowboys program is a fun experience in many ways.  While I was in the Seagoing Cowboys program I made nine trips it was the most of any Seagoing Cowboy it was great. I saw so many amazing places I thought I would never be able to see because I was just a normal person in my town. I saw Europe and China while I was in the program it was a great experience for me as a almost adult. I also had the advantage of taking a gondola ride in Venice,Italy, it was the city with the streets of water. I also had a awesome chance at touring the excavated castle in Crete and marveled at the Panama Canal on my way to China in the Seagoing trip. You should join it so you can see all those amazing places I just stated to you that I have seen because of this amazing experience in the Seagoing Cowboys. Another reason you should join it is because if you are almost 18 and you do not want to get military drafted then join this, they count it as your service or they did for me which means they will for you. Another one is after the animals get dropped off and we are going back with no animals we get to play amazing games in the stalls that the animals were in like baseball and volleyball, we also played table-tennis tournaments or even boxing.  These are all the amazing things i got to do and see, you could see and do them to if you join Seagoing Cowboys.  Taking participation in the Seagoing Cowboys program is more of a different world then an adventure! This program helps you think of the people in need and how much you have helped them. Participating in this fun program is a great idea! Just imagine... riding on a boat, mist spraying, cooling you off after a long day herding animals. You have the benefit to see and tour many places that you have never seen before! ",

                "content": "When students are forced to complete something they do not enjoy some people just will not do it. If students enjoy the project and look forward to it many more will complete it. For example, I have been assigned many projects during my life. When a teacher gives the students more than one way they can do the project it always has more submissions than if it was only an essay. Specifically, after reading a book, my class had to do a final report. When the teacher gave us options such as a: poster, essay, picture, or model it had many submissions.  but students aren't enjoying the assignment because they aren't able to express their knowledge that is different from everyone else. Letting the students create their own projects will give them the opportunity to be creative and express their ideas. Additionally, students will continue to use or remember the skills and knowledge prior to help them create their projects.  It's always best to give students options, and letting them enjoy what they do best at, but it's not right\u00a0to force them into doing what they don't want to do; yes I agree that after school activities should be in school, and open to all students.  Don't force students into something they don't feel comfortable\u00a0with, but recommend it to them so they can think about it.  The danger in this scenario is that when a student becomes uninterested in what they are learning, it causes the student to not pay attention and stop doing work because of the lack of strive to learn. Not only does this situation cause a strain on the student who did not do his or her work, and the teacher, but also the other students in the class. The other students are also effected, because the teacher is now required to take the time out of the new lessons to re-teach what should have already been learned. To prevent this lack of gusto, summer projects should be chosen by the students so they can pick a topic that makes them want to learn.  Let's say the options the school provides are all not of interest to them, so they're forced to take something they don't want to do. How would you like to be forced to commit to something you didn't want to do to start with? I'm pretty sure no one would want that. Though extracurricular activities are great for students to do, some are just reserved and are shy when having to do things in front of people. For students with anxiety, that is extremely embarrassing. Plus, if you force someone to do something they don't want to do, they'll just do it with half-effort and that makes everything one step harder for the people who actually wanted to do that activity. I can almost guarantee that this will happen if schools force students to do this, and it'll just make the activities less fun for the ones who actually want to do it.  When given a task you do not enjoy, most people do either of two things. The first thing they do is rush the task to get it over with, and the second thing they do is push it off as much as they can. Similarly, when a student is given an assignment that is not of interest to them, the quality of work is very low. In reference to the summer, this general idea is heightened; a majority of students tend to push off assignments to the very latest, creating lackluster work and also not learning much from the assignment. Personally, I have experienced this repeatedly. When I was given a summer assignment for my English class this year, I was eager to read the book. While, the book was interesting the assignment was extremely long. The intended goal of the assignment was to expand the knowledge and analysis of the book, but after completing the assignment, I felt like that once held excitement and knowledge was gone. If I had the ability to design my own assignment relating to the book, I most likely would have enjoyed completing the assignment, allowing for an expansion of knowledge. This does not only apply to my experiences with summer assignments, but also applies to my overall experience as a student. When given the liberty to decide my own work, I am not only excited to work, but I am also more dedicated. When my education is in my hands, I produce some of my best work. Currently as a junior enlisted in a self led research class, I have learned so much about myself and the overall topic I am researching. Although at first the task at hand was daunting, I learned how to organize myself effectively and complete a thorough research project that I am happy with. By having the research project on my own, I am constantly thinking about it and I spend more time to work. Giving students the ability to decide their course of work is one of the most beneficial decisions a teacher can make for the future of a student.  In cases where a student may not understand something, having to physically be there in a school building and ask a question, the teacher can demonstrate carefully and step by step till the student is able to get a grasp of what is being taught and questions are clarified. Some students just prefer having the need to be around to understand, it makes it better for them. Whereas, when students are far away and learning through a video conference or online, it may be harder to understand because demonstrations may be a little unclear through a video. when there is a need for a question, doing classes online there's no one to ask at times so students have to go the extra mile of looking into researches, YouTube videos, etc before they're able to understand. something which waste time from their studies and brings conflict. Video conferencing is not advisable and taking classes may be better face to face which brings peace and makes things better.  If a student is doing poorly in a subject they do not particularly care for, the sport they participate in after school makes them feel better about what they do. It also gives them incentive to do better in the subject they aren't doing so well in.   \u00a0At first when you decide to participate activities such as school clubs, you may be hesitant because you don't know if you will enjoy what you're going to do there, but your ideas might change after spending time there. If there was a rule saying that students did have to participate in an extracurricular activity, some students might feel as though they are being forced and won't enjoy their time participating in it. However, a lot of students' viewpoints may change over time and they grow to love the activity that they're doing. These kinds of activities can help students discover more about how they like spending their time. A poll performed on Harvard University students showed that 84% of students didn't know what they wanted to major in before joining an extracurricular activity in either middle school or high school. A similar experiment performed by Generic_School showed that, when the principal decided all students must participate in an extracurricular activity, 92% of students enjoyed the activity that they participated in throughout the school year. It also showed that 65% of those students decided to continue that extracurricular activity the following year because they liked doing it. Schools offer many different kinds of activities to participate in, and they can help you discover both your passions and hobbies. When you discover what your passionate about in a certain activity, it also gives you the opportunity to socialize with peers participating in the same activity that might be interested in the same things you are.  At home, a student has limited resources and won't be able to receive support and feedback from teachers and classmates. If a student takes a class online, there won't be any teacher to tell him or her what and how to do the work. And so if a student is stuck on what they're supposed to do, or if they did something incorrectly, then they won't be have the chance for improvement or learn from their mistakes. Feedback is critical for a student's growth, and without a personal relationship with a teacher, there is no growth ",

                "content": "This technology could also help both students and teachers in a long-term manner. In paragraph 7 of the article, it is revealed that this new technology could \"even indicate the difference between a genuine smile and a forced one\" (Paragraph 7). Say there is a classroom without an emotion-sensing computer. In the classroom there is a student who, behind the fake smile is dealing with something that they cannot tackle on their own. The teacher never notices, and the child goes on without help. Now imagine if there was a computer in that class  The people using this technology are doing so many things, \"The process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face;\" So they're not only using 3-D software but also, \"Using video imagery, the new emotion-recongnition software tracks these facial movements.\" The people who are specializing in doing this kind of technology, are branching out in very large, and impactful ways. Many students could be interested in doing this, and sometimes if it's not in school and they don't hear of it. They can never find it.  New technology is being introduced to mankind almost every second in this world, and now, the latest techonology is a computer program called the Facial Action Coding System which can identify a person's emotions. The question is whether this technology is actually valuable and for what it could be used for. Experts suggest this technology could be used in a classroom to identify the state of mind of a student to adjust the lesson they are trying to comprehend. But, even though this technology may be helpful to teachers trying to keep students active and engrossed in their lessons, the question arises of whether this techonlogy is actually worth the recources or whether what experts think is a great idea is actually an invasion of privacy.  According to the article \"Making Mona Lisa Smile,\" there is a new technology called the Facial Action Coding System (FACS) that enables computers to identify human emotions. This technology is relatively brand new. It creates a 3-D computer model of all fourty-four major muscles in the face that move like human muscles as well. Then, psychologists have classified six basic emotions that are associated with different movements in the facial mucles. This new technology could result in many benefits in our community as well as all around the world  The highly inteliigent Facial Action Coding System a valuable asset for students in a classroom, as it fosters an enjoyable and captivating learning environment that will shape the students' commitment to school. This advanced software analyzes the movement of a human's facial muscles, comparing it to an emotionless one, and determines the percent distribution their feelings. This innovative software provides students with the ability to customize the pages and lessons on the computer, giving them control over their method of learning. Students with this ability will feel captivated by their learning, as they are in control and can decide how they learn. The development of a desire to learn is crucial for school-aged children so that in the future, they will continue on to further educate themselves and expand their knowledge. This facial  -analysis technology provides schools with the ability to create a captivating learning environment for students that will motivate them to stay committed to their education and reach their goals. While this new technology provides a bounty of benefits to many, assisting students in the achievement of their hopes and dreams holds the most value.  Dr. Huang is talking about the device using video images to pick up the emotions of each person. Dr. H states \"using video imagery, The new emotion recognition software tracks these facial movments in a real face or on a painted face.\" This quote brings to light that the machine can read emotions but one could say since it is still in new development that not all of the bugs or glitches have been worked out not only that but you also have to devote more resources to keep the machine working which can average to be a heafty hit to your wallet.  The article states that the technology associates each emotion with \"characteristic movements of the facial muscles\" and then uses those movements to calculate the spectrum of emotions based on their facial display. But some people show emotions in various ways, and the technology most likely cannot accomodate for the many different ways people express the same emotion. For example, if a student has a resting face that seems generally happy, the system might confuse this dazed face as a satisfied face and think that the student is happy with their lessons when they are actually confused or not paying attention. In the same way, if a student has a resting face that looks naturally sad, the system may think they are unhappy with their lessons, even if the student feels they are learning a lot. A lot of students also try to hide their emotions, like frusteration or sadness, with a happier look on their face, and even though the article states that the system can detect a \"false smile\", it cannot always be accurate as a person may be good at hiding their emotions and displaying a genuine smile. Therefore, since technology is not always accurate and because human beings are so various in the way they behave, the technology would not be useful in a classroom where it may misread a student's state of mind and lead them in the wrong path of education.  In conclusion, the ability to read the actual emotion and reactions of students in class rooms is extremely valuable because it allows for greater understanding and excitment of a subject, along with the ability to help students be emotionally stable. If this technology is implemented into schools, studnets will overall do better, feel better and make a brighter world for tomorrow. FACS is something revolutionary that hopefully all of us can learn somthing from.  New software has been created to determine the facial expressions of students. It uses technology to give data as to what emotions someone is feeling such as happiness, sadness, and boredom. These technologies are possibly going to be used in classrooms to help students learn better based on their emotions towards the lesson that they are learning.  The quality of learning in a classroom setting could be improved by teachers knowing the emotions of their students, which would make new technology such as the Facial Action Coding System, valuable in a classroom setting. This technololgy would be beneficial because it could identify whether students are confused or bored, which would make class time more productive and interesting, as well as make sure all students understood the material. This would improve their quality of learning, and make school more meaningful. ",

(D'Alto 1). With this in mind, if students were able to be introduced and subject to this technology, there could be future scientist that want to further improve this technology and, until then, would be more involved in it's place at school. (D'Alto 1). Also, due to the fact that this technology is not only limited to the classroom, it is then evident that other jobs could be produced out of this technology being in the classroom, sparking interest in young and vulnerable students. As the author includes, \"The same technology can make computer-animated faces more expressive--for video games or video surgery,\" it is showsn just exactly how various the fields are that this technology could be used in. (D'Alto 6). Whether a kid is devoted to learning about medicne or engrossed in playing games, it has been shown that this technology in the classrooms would expose these kids to it's capabilities and potentially create a passion. (D'Alto 6). Therefore, by including this technolgy in the classroom with it's own purpose, the students would be subject to technolgy that is blooming in several fields and could easily inspire a child to become something that utilizes this technology in their future.  Initially, the thought of additional advancement of technology is frightening. Predicting ideas is not always a sure way of indicating what will occur. However, after Dr. Huang introduces and explains his new concept of Facial Action Coding System Technology, it is arduous to reject the placement of this software into everyday life. Hopefully, the program will be installed soon so it can start making improvements in various industries across the board.  Thomas Haung's new software would not only find useages in a classroom, but also in daily life.  Slip into a world where emotions are easily read. There could be no mind games, no pettiness, and no suffering in silence;this could be the new reality. In the article \"Making Mona Lisa Smile\" by Nick D'Alto, he introduces a new concept created by Thomas Haung:Facial Action Coding System software. This programming system allows computers to register all of the emotions on an individual's face, reguardless if they are mixed.  Dr. Huang is talking about the device using video images to pick up the emotions of each person. Dr. H states \"using video imagery, The new emotion recognition software tracks these facial movments in a real face or on a painted face.\" This quote brings to light that the machine can read emotions but one could say since it is still in new development that not all of the bugs or glitches have been worked out not only that but you also have to devote more resources to keep the machine working which can average to be a heafty hit to your wallet.  There is a saying that goes as this; \"You can't make everyone happy.\" One would typically use this saying if an action they make improves the situation for one person, but creates a worse situation for another. However, if Professor Thomas Huang's new 'Facial Action Coding System' proves to be what he says it can be, then Huang believes that there actually is a way to make everyone happy, even in the school setting.  To start, in order for this new technology to work, students woukld have to constantly be watched by cameras that read their expressions.  I agree with Dr. Hung that the software would be useful to help decipher mixed emoitions.   Technology in the classroom has already begun to advance rapidly with educational websites such as ; Google Classroom, Edulastic, Khan Academy,and Mathia. The facial recognition technology could enhance a students comprehension to maximum potential.

                "content": "So, while some conspiracy theorists would like to think that aliens created this well-known face on Mars, they are incorrect. The face on Mars is just a natural landform that was wrongly perceived by the public. By advancing in digital technology, understanding the effect of shadows, and realizing that there is no evidence to support aliens on Mars, it can be concluded that the face on Mars is just another peculiar natural landform.  I find it highly unrealistic that NASA would even have been able to determine what the Face was forty years ago, much less hiding a discovery of extra-terrestrial life that could make a huge profit for the space program. And, had NASA really claimed that the Face was an object built by otherworldly life, surely someone would let the cat out of the bag. Not to mention that, if the vast majority of NASA believed it was an alien monument, do you really think that they would wait eighteen years to investigate the subject again? On top of all of this, it's simply illogical that aliens would create such a thing. As far as we all know, the supposed \"aliens\" on Mars have never come in contact with a human, much less seen one. That only leaves possible explanation; aliens created a monument that of which coincedentally resembles a human head. An absolute coincedence.  With all of the technology used to investigate the red planet, proof of alien life should have already been found. Jim Garvin, chief scientist for NASA's Mars Exploration Program explained, \"As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size...So, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!\" By stating this, Garvin is saying that if there was any evidence of aliens builing this face on Mars, it would have been found.  With very high resolutioned photos, it is hard for conspiracy theorists to still say that there is face on Mars. It even says in paragraph 11,\" So if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!\"  About twenty-five years ago, something happened around Mars. NASA, snapped photos of the object. On Mars, there is a face printed on the plant. People think it was created by aliens. NASA said it was created on it's own. Scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa. Those are common around Cydonia. A couple of days later NASA saw a nose, eyes, and a mouth.  In conclusion, some people may think there is alien life on Mars because of past picture or conspiracy theories. No one can denty however, that NASA has proven the Face to be nothing but a natural landform on the Red Planet Mars. NASA has proven this by recent pictures, scientific evidence, and real-life examples and measurements. Over the years, NASA has worked hard to figure out the mystery of the face, and just recently they have discovered, with pictyures, evidence, and measruements, that the Face is just a natural landform with unusual shadowing formed on the Red Planet Mars.  Even if the cameras used to take these pictures weren't of the highest quality, said cameras would have been able to at least catch some photos of further signs of life. Things such as houses or buildings, for example. Now, if some one would like to argue that the aliens lived in caves or other natural formations of the sort, how would those people like to argue the fact that there are no visible creatures in any photos? Do they expect people to believe that every living thing on Mars decided to hide from a satelite they would not even be able to see from the surface?  Aliens never made the Face of Mars and the Face of Mars isn't real at all! It's just a natural landform by having the shadows covering up most of the landform making it appear as a face. For the conclusion, Cydonia has a natural landform on it that appears itself as a face using the shadows to make the illusion.  It does look like it could be from another living organism, but it's just a rock on the planet. In our newest image of the rock, it turns out that the face has dissapered. There is no evidence of this being created by aliens, rather it was created by wind and water that has been found on Mars. The reason you might believe that this was indeed aliens, might be the fact that the news has blown it out of poportion. It's just the rock that had some interesting shadows and holes that made it look like a human face.  While NASA never spoke negatively about the theory, they set out again to prove it wrong. on April 8, 2001, the Mars Global Surveyor came over the face on Mars, and it took photos with a resolution of 1.56 meters per pixel; the highest ever yet. What these pictures showed was what would be a butte or a mesa on Earth. These landforms are very common in Cydonia, so the pictures were very realistic. ",

But this make more and more people to make smarter than this way to make people life easier.  Then they find a new way to developed driver's seats and they have lights.

                "content": "Driverless cars can allow people to safely engage in other activities besides driving, allowing them to achieve and accomplish more. Driving can be tiring, and driverless cars eliminate driving as a task for people to complete. Many factors can impair driving ability and prevent one from driving, but with driverless cars, mobility is always possible, and transportation is always accessible. A Google cofounder estimates that driverless cars can eventually eliminate the need for personal cars at all, by introducing a public transportation system of entirely driverless vehicles, and that these vehicles can use half the fuel of current taxis. This can have huge benefits for the environment.  Driverless cars may promote many benefits to humans seeking leisure and comfort while driving, but driverless cars could prove to create some very serious safety issues, especially on the busy roads of today's society.  The idea of driverless cars is a great idea because the environment will benefit from it greatly and human error on the roads will become a thing of the past.  Ultimately, driverless cars would have an extreme influence on today's society. The assistance from technology has changed the world we live in and will continue to do so. Driverless cars are the step in the right direction for driving innovations all across the world.  Because of these specific examples in the article \"Driverless Cars Are Coming,\" I believe that driverless cars will be very beneficial to America and it's many modes of transportation. Driverless cars will use less fuel than our typical cars we use today. They will also require an immensely small amount of attention. Most importantly, any small flaw that these cars possess will be resolved extremely soon. Driverless cars will change our lives for the better.  There are pros and cons for any situation, but in the case of driverless cars, the pros seem to greatly outweigh the cons.  The quality of life would increase, and the variable of the human driver would be eliminated. Driverless cars would be an excellent addition to the car lots and would be an amazing tool for people in everyday life.  The new-age technology provided in the driverless cars will make for a smarter car with the ability to be aware of the road, cars, and people, as well as any trouble that happens unexpectedly.  This technology also creates a safer drive while being efficient to the passengers and the environment.  With all of these self-driving features, the human driver will feel in control when navigating the required situations.  All of these technological advancements lead to a promising future of driverless cars everywhere.  Driverless cars come with baggage on both sides of good and bad, but with a little more knowledge and research it could change someone's opinion overtime. They could potentially save someone's life and other people surrounding them. They could save a new driver's life and could even help them learn all of the skills of the road. With the new techonology we have in this new future, we could cut the wreck numbers in half to seventy five percent. Driverless cars are not a bad idea and they could possibly save this world.  having driverless cars in the world would not be nearly as safe as human intelligence.  The driverless cars will be more of a distraction on to the passengers and essentially, will not help any of the passengers nor pedestrians around them.  There are much too many scenarios that could go wrong rather than if a human driver was actually in control.  The use of driverless cars can vary from ecofriendly transportation to customization for individual scheduals. ",

                "content": "This is because the students who are enrolled in schools may look forward to getting out of the house and seeing their friends every morning, while the students who are enrolled in online schooling have to stay in, isolated from things beyond their household. This may cause harm on the mental health of the students taking school online because they may feel excluded from the world around them. Feeling excluded from the world around them may place a sense of loneless in their life, which may lead to depression. Students should be surrounded by others as they grow so they can maintain a healthy mental state, and be happy.  Helping those less fortunate is a humbling experience. You learn how to be a better person and you want to try harder in life. I once worked at a soup kitchen. I saw kids just like me with parents just like mine and they were starving. I am lucky and I learned just how fortunate I was there. I know that if some of the 'bad' kids went, they would appreciate what they have and be a better student. School isn't just about math and writing its about preparing you for life. An experience like this would defiantly teach you a life lesson.  In education we always have a choice to choose rather we get our education at home or through public and private school but which one is the right choice ? Throughout this essay we will explore the pros and cons on which one is the more beneficial choice. Many kids in life go to public schools since the start of their education life but there are those that choose to get education at home. A child's\u00a0personality also adds on to what the better choice might be for that certain individual. There are a lot of benefits and non-benefits to having a student attend classes from home.  It is a very stressful situation for those students that have fallen ill to catch up to their peers. Missing out on a proper education due to something that could not be controlled is a very stressful situation in it of itself. There are parents that force their kids to go to school despite being sick, putting other students at risk of illness and not giving the sick student a proper learning experience. It gets even worse for those unfortunately inflicted with terminal illness, who must miss school for long periods at a time  In this new era of social media and technology, \"social media influencer\" is a very popular career path for people to take on. This generally entails posting pictures or videos, having sponsorships with companies, and interacting with their fan bases. Another common facet for this lifestyle is travelling. With all of this extra work these influencers choose to incorporate into their lives, school becomes a lot harder to maintain. Online based learning, in this case, makes it a lot more accessible and easy for these young kids to finish their education while still pursuing their dreams.  Putting one-hundred percent of their efforts into academic-related activities, such as studying for exams, doing their homework, etcetera, will help students in the long run.  They will get better grades, go to better colleges, get better jobs, and ultimately live better lives. This policy encourages this needed hard work in school, thus, is a commendable one.  Some children in other parts of the world do not get to have a choice in how they receive an education, so giving the option does matter. Each student perceives knowledge in a different way and because the world is changing with technology and the internet, attending classes at home by the way of online or video conferencing does not sound like such a horrific idea.  This allows for the kids to get a personalized education that fits best with how they learn. If one kid needs more practice, they are able to practice while another kid may be ready to move onto the next. This way the one that is moving on isn't being held back by the kid who might want a little more time on a unit or topic. Students create their own education plan which is also good for the teacher because sometimes it may not be easy, in a classroom setting, to spot when a kid needs a little more attention and work on a topic because they have to move as a group to finish all the units before a final or AP exam. Personalized education through online classes would allow for kids to finish everything before these exams but still learn the way they see best fit.  More students might get better grades because they have something to work for. This could open up students to a new way of learning. Students might notice that they have done so well just to play sports, that they might as well keep it up. More parents will be proud and students will get what they want. Students will learn that they must work hard to earn something. This could help them carry on in their lives an successful people. Just one situation can lead to great things. This will teach students to value hard work and dedication when trying to pursue a goal or dream. More students might understand why their parents work so hard everyday to support them. Parents are working hard to pursue their goal of raising a child that will succeed in life.   Many homes that house one or more students are normally very busy place. Take an average middle class family, around two parents and three children. At least one parent has work, so they are away for they majority of the day. The other parent must now be the one to shuttle the students to doctors appointments, and cannot leave them home. The parent would have to decide between taking their children to everywhere the parent goes, and distracting the children from education, or leaving them home alone. Either the students would not be able to focus on their work, or the parent would not get anything useful done. Say they had a nanny to watch the children while the parents work. Now the children have to be impossibly restrained to keep themselves from bothering each other. Imagine trying to focus on a physics lecture while trying to stop a young child from coming into your room screaming ",

So these Electoral College followers agree with the electors actually selecting the winner because they don't have to do anything. People can just sit back and watch the electors take the power, while the others do nothing but be slumps. In source one, the Office of the Federal Register mention that \"when you vote for your candidate you are actually voting for your candidate's electors.\", which means that if voters have friends in the position of an elector, voters might just vote for the elector because theres nothing else to really pay attention to.  The U.S government lets people choose these electors so they feel important in the choices our country makes. We take time to study our favorite candidates, and if the electoral college does not agree with them, they are pushed to the side. What happens to the people who did not vote for the, \"right\" candidate? They are forever unheard. Sentenced to live in a community where they are silcenced. I do not agree with the electoral college because agree with our fore father Abraham Lincoln. He said this was supposed to be a country of the people, by the people, and for the people.   But some people don't really know what they are voting for in election which is why the Electoral College is the way to go. Also people complained with the \"winners take all method\" some candidates don't go to certain states and only focus on the swing states. In the 2000 campaign seventeen out of fifty states didn't see the candidates. But the candidates didn't go to those states since they knew they had no chance of winning those states and they needed to focus on the swing states to make sure they win the election. Many people do call the Electoral College an anachronism, but it doesn't need to stick in the past, it needs to be kept in the present and in the future.  A lot of voters who are not very well educated may not even understand what the electoral college is or what they are actually voting for when they vote. Instead of voting for the candidate that they want as the next president, they are voting for a group of electors that decide who will win. Sometimes, the electors that are assigned to that candiadate will not vote for them. This process also seems to disriciminate against the less populated states because they don't have as much a say in the college and are often forgoten in the rush of propaganda and aren't really aware of who they should pick and why they should pick them.  People from all around the country don't think that the electoral college is a intelligent way of voting. So they are fighting changing the electoral process to popular vote rather than voting for a state of electors  \u00a0 In the article,\"Does the Electoral College Work\", it states that becasue of the diffrent sizes of our states some people feel they do not get a fair say in who makes decisions for our country. They feel that because they dont live in a big state like Texas they do not have equal say in the decisions our country makes. In the article Plumer wrote, \" In the same vein, faithless electors have pccasionally refused to vote for their party's canidate and cast a deciding vote for whoever they please...\". The Electoral College is changing peoples mind set on how to vote because they feel why should we care if the government does not, can you blame them? If we just took out the simple problem of the Electoral College more voters will vote honestly rather then go with everyone elses vote.  When hearing about the Electoral College, most people think of a group of individuals casting votes based on the popularity of the candidate in their state. What they don't know is that \"the Electoral College is a process, not a place\"(source 1) Some people, like Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, and Bob Dole, have all thought that the Electoral College should be abolished and be replaced by the popular vote. According to a poll taken in 2000, 60 percent of voters believe the precidency should be decided on the popular vote (source 2).  Most people do not like the Electoral College because they are not directly voting for their canidate  Some might argue that the Electoral College is flawed because electors can choose not to vote for their canidate. It is true that this has happened in the past,  \"Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president.\" (Bradford Plumer). The public is starting to not like that their vote is not directly going toward the presidential vote but towards a group of electors that decide the fate of the presidency. \"the Electoral College method is not emocratic in a modern sense.\" (Richard A Posner). The public is also starting to feel that this is not a true Democracy with this system. \"Consider that state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors, and that those electors could always defy the will of the people.\" (Bradford Plumer). The public is starting to not like that feeling that the electors can just turn on the public and not vote for what some people want (and it has happened a few times in the past). \"'faithless' electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please.\" (Bradford Plumer). That is another worry of the public, no matter what party the elector belongs to, they can vote for anyone they want. \"Perhaps most worrying is the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote. In that case, the elcetion would be thrown to the House of Representatives, where state delegations vote on the president.\"(Bradford Plumer). The people are also not liking the fact that an elector representing a small amount of people has as much to say as an elector representing millions of people. All and all, it is hard to deny that there are a few problems with the electoral college and that this causes the public to worry come election time. ",

In 1960, segregationists in the lousiana legislature tried to get rid of the democratic electors. They wanted to replace them with people who would oppose John F Kennedy. Sourse 2, number 11 says \"In some vein, faithless electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for whoever they please...\" This means that with an Electoral college, the person you want to vote for may not even get picked cause of lying electors.  That is in the second paragraph and it really gets my attention, \"Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for the slate of electors, who in turn elect the president.\" With this in mind it is telling us the people that we are not voting for the president at all that is what most people believe that they are doing so you are kind of lying to some of them.  Source 3 states, \"...each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee (and that truth is barely betrayed)... however it is entirely possible that the winner of the electoral vote will not win the national popular vote.\" For instance, if the people vote for candidates for the electoral college, and the majority of them are not what the majority of the people wanted, or they lied about being pledged to a candidate for president, then there is still a chance that the candidate that the people did want could be elected, by the national popular vote. Also, the people that are against the electoral college shouldn't be, because the electoral college is not definite. Just because the electoral colleg votes for a certain candidate, does not guarantee that the overall national vote will be that person.  Now the fact is that the electoral college works well for our country, but when the population that is voting for president is actually voting for a candidate to vote for their state, that is lying to the voters and is morally wrong. We cannot lie to the population and be a strong country at the same time. We want to vote for our country's leaders not have someone else vote for us.  A lot of voters who are not very well educated may not even understand what the electoral college is or what they are actually voting for when they vote. Instead of voting for the candidate that they want as the next president, they are voting for a group of electors that decide who will win.

Many people do call the Electoral College an anachronism, but it doesn't need to stick in the past, it needs to be kept in the present and in the future.  First of all we don't know who picks the electors. We don't know if there truthful as in putting in votes. I'm sure they have to have certain requirments to become an elector but we are not the ones chosing them. In the 2000 campaign 17 states didn't even see the people running in the election. Also in an Electoral College ties exist so then it has to be thrown into the House of Represenatives where the delagations will vote on the president. Making our votes worthless because the people in the goverment get to chose whos next to become president.   There has been times when voters have casted votes for the wrong candidate. The voters know about the presidential candidate not the elector. States often do not get the same level of campaigning as eachother. According to  Slate Magazine a larger state gets more attention from the presidential candidates than a smaller state does. Over 60 percent of citizens who vote would like a direct election instead of the kind we have now, says Bradford Palmer.   because candidates don't spent time in the states they know they will lose in. They only foucus on the states that they know they will win in or of a close chance to the other candidate, because of this there has been times when people would not see the candidates at all or they did'nt get to see a single campaign ad. If there was popular vote then this would not be the case and it would be eliminated, because candidates would have no choice but to put up advertisments all over the country.  When you go to vote, you don't actually vote for the candidate, you vote for a group of people who in turn vote for the candidate. I find this to be ineffective, because the people you are voting for are still able to switch there vote to the other party, ",

The author explains how humans are naturally curious, and how this curiosity often times leads them to dangerous situations. Studying Venus has its dangers, but it is no different. Also stated, \"Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation\" (8). The author is promoting curiosity because it leads us to new things. Curiosity can overcome the fear of danger when exploring Venus to help us learn new things about the planet. To summarize, the power of curiosity in people is something the author uses to support their opinion of Venus being worth it to explore.  There are many dangers that come along with studying planets. Along with the dangers, there are also countless benefits to learning more about different planets. In the passage, \"The Challenge of Exploring Venus\", the author addresses the point that Venus is worth taking a closer look at and focusing on, no matter the dangers it could put one in.  Ultimatley, it is understandable why one would believe that it isn't smart to look into studying and experimenting with Venus; however, the examples of the researched facts and past experiences help to support the authors idea that despite the dangers, Venus is worthy of studying. There may be many dangers that come along with studying different planets, but based off the evidence the author provided, Venus has avoidable ways to make it safe to study.  In coclusion, the authors final claim states, \"Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation.\" Although there are many dangers that could seek upon them, they take them as \"challenges\" and are willing to dig deeper to find out why Venus is the way it is. \"Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth- like planet in our solar system.\" Therefore, this is why the author does a good job by suggesting that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents.     In summary, we should continue studying the planet Venus despite the dangers because if anything were to happen to our planet, Earth, Venus would be the closest planet we could go to, we could learn more about Venus and the planet's harsh conditions, and because Venus is most like Earth and had the ability to support life. Furthering our research on Venus can only benefit us, so lets stop worrying about the dangers and get out and explore our planetary neighbor.  People have studied the many planets in our solar system and are fastinated by them. People have also studied the solar system to help explore and give information about the planets around us. One planet that scientists have studied for a good amount of time is Venus since it shows that at one time, the planet might have inhabited living organisms. However, Venus is a very dangerous planet since many attempts of landing spacecraft has failed on Venus and the clouds of the planet are made of sulfuric acid. Venus is not worth the pursuit of knowledge since the planet has a very dangerous enviorment for humans and that not a single spacecraft has landed safely on the planet and returned.  However, the author has also found that studying Venus could be beneficial considering its proximity and similar geographical features to Earth.  Therefore, the author supports his idea, \"that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents,\" by giving us multiple reasons why we need the knowlage, how it affects us and how we will accomplish that. First, by telling us that Venus is like our twin planet and learning what happened we could adapt. Secondly, by showing us that we are can prevent our own downfall. Lastly, the author tells us how NASA expects to pull this off.  In paragraph three the text illustrates,\"On the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet.\" This piece of text from paragraph three shows that we should continue studying Venus because it will allow us to learn more about the plant's harsh conditions and we would be able to see what materials could or couldn't work in such extreme heat.  The author states, \"NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray.\". Stating ways that Venus can be studied with people not being put in danger helps get the authors point across. The article also touches on how floating above the surface could keep those studying the planet safe. Temperatures would still be high, but nothing the spacecraft couldn't handle, the air pressure would be like how it is on Earth at sea level, soloar power would be bountiful, and radiation would be no higher than the levels on Earth. The text then states, \"Not easy conditions, but survivable for humans.\". Although this would not be an easy job, it is possible to study Venus safely. The details used in this paragraph help convey the authors point that studying Venus can be done safely and that it should continue to happen. ",

The Electoral Collage Creates a dicided ground; as whell as, equal and justified representation.  I think that they should keep the electoral collage because the founding fathers established it in the Constitution as a compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens.  The voters are left with an unfair outcome at almost every election because of the Electoral Collage. The votes can either be very close or the people could miss Ads or campaigns for canidates, leaving the people with nothing and confusion all over. Even if you knew what elector you voted for, you cant necessarily pick who it is your voting for and your vote could possibly get confued giving you a bad outcome. Most elections are just slid by and are just based on what ever the Electoral College thinks should happen. So please abolish the Electoral College its is irrational and is not neccessary, let the people really have a fair chance.  Moreover, the disaster facor has a huge impact on the electoral collage.  I get that they have to monitor the votes but arnt we already using electronic computers to vote... I think voting would go alot smoother if the votes went strait to the presidents through computers instead of having an elector who has a strong personal opinion against one political party who has a chance of twisting the votes around to strongly support the political party that he/she is opinionized towards. This why the Electoral Collage is dangerous. There have been cases of law breaking electors twisting the votes around. It is alot more safe to just let the citizens to just strait up vote.  Many argue that without the Electoral Collage equal power would be given to the people and that \"most people worry is the prosepct of a tie in the electoral vote\"-source 2.  The electorial collage should be changed to the popular voting method because it is unfair to the voters.  All in all, the electoral collage should be banished from the government.\u00a0 Who wants our government to get weaker and more unfair to the citizens?\u00a0 By taking away the electoral college our government would gain back its strength and become the hard- working government we know it can be!     Abolishment of the Electoral Collage would not give power to all states and, would highten potential for bias political leaders.  ",

                "content": "For example, many people believe their vote goes to waste. As stated in the article by Richard Posner, \"Democrats in Texas, for example, or Republicans in California. Knowing their vote will have no effect, they have less incentive to pay attention to the campaign they would have if the president were picked by popular vote.\" Voters want to feel involved and have interest in the political system. People also fear the tie in an electoral vote. They feel like the government will choose whoever will benefit them the best and they won't take the people into consideration. In article, \"The Indensible Electoral College: Why even the best laid defenses of the system are wrong\", the author says the electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. He believes it's anachronism.  Popular vote is a much better idea not only becuase it is more realistic, but because it is easier to understand. Even some of our presidents like Richard Nixon and Bob Dole have thought that this was the way to go. Not only do they believe this, but they lost their presidency votes becuase of the electoral college. I think that they are just trying to scam voters and pick someone that would be best for them, not for our country. I think that by using the electoral college method, they are cheating into picking the winners, but if we used popular vote, this wouldnt happen.  for example if one state candidate was choosen for republican and they were \"faithless\" as it says in source two, and chose the democratic party it would be very unfortunate for the republicans because than there would be no point of the votes the republican supporters have voted for. It only comes once every four years, this is very important to the american people, on choosing who they want for the future of america.  The electoral votes decide who wil get what, who will win. Popular vote in no longer in \"session\" or popular, the electoral votes decide it now. For example, in the 2000 election, when Gore had a lot more popular votes than Bush, but Gore had less electoral votes, it was a shocking suprise for the nation, it seemed to be like more people liked Gore than Bush. One very important thing to consider is ... the reason why Bush won, there is a huge diffrence between making a good choice, aka Gore, and and making the right choice, aka Bush  A lot of voters who are not very well educated may not even understand what the electoral college is or what they are actually voting for when they vote. Instead of voting for the candidate that they want as the next president, they are voting for a group of electors that decide who will win. Sometimes, the electors that are assigned to that candiadate will not vote for them. This process also seems to disriciminate against the less populated states because they don't have as much a say in the college and are often forgoten in the rush of propaganda and aren't really aware of who they should pick and why they should pick them.  For example, if you lived in Texas. And you wanted to vote for John Kerry, you'd vote for a slate of 34 Democratic electoers. Witch in most cases would be O.K., but they could betray the party and vote for whom they please. It doesn't always happen but the possibility is real.\u00a0 And people, like the segregationists back in 1960, could have gone agenst their party and pick electors to go agenst Kennedy.  Additionally, Plumer explains, \"If you lived in texas, for instance, and wanted to vote for [John] Kerry, you'd vote for a slate of 34 Democratic electors pledged to Kerry.\" Why should kerry earn 34 electoral votes. He should earn the amount of voters in that state he persuaded to vote for him. He should not earn the electoral votes of all the people that did not think he was the best presidential candidate. Every vote should count, and that is why the electoral college should be eliminated.   In conclusion, the popular voting method should be applied as the designated process of electing the United States President because it guarantees a direct vote towards a desired candidate of your choice. As our country is listed as a democracy, the votes towards the President should lie in the hands of the people. The electoral college is prone to many more problems and is a more complex method of voting. With votes in the hands of the people, voters can get a full \" hands on\" voting experience. As to not repeat myself, in this way voters can really understand the voting system and get the idea in their head their vote is going towards their chosen candidate. Popular voting has not only been proven to be the more preferred method of voting, but in my opinion, shall be the established method of voting to use in the future elections.    All in all, arguments can be made both ways...for the Electoral College process or against it. The citizens of America deserve the very best person to lead them, and that's exactly who we should get...the one that America votes for. I know that there are more efficient and fair ways to do this, all we need to do is use them. At the end of the day though, using the election by popular vote would ensure that everyone would be 100% sure that their vote went for who they wanted, and that's what counts.     It would then go to the House of Representatives, who might not even have the want of the people in mind. Since most of the time Congress has a party that makes up a majority of it, it would be very unfair to allow them to pick the president. It's also possible that even if a majority of the people vote for a president, the electoral votes elect the other candidate instead, like what happened to Al Gore in 2000. An election like this just has too many holes and pitfalls to be efficient. The holes need to be repaired before we can actually use this as our primary way to select a president, or else we're setting ourselves up to have problems in the future. ",

                "content": "The human body has way more than just six emotions so getting a high accuracy reading on how you are really feeling is out of the question because FACS uses the a process of a 3-D model Dr. Huang states \"The process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D model of the face; all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles.\" This quote explains that it has to use a way of making a model which can sometimes take some time depending on the processing power of the computer not only that but human emotions can change quite quickly and if the pc doesnt make the model fast enough the computer can easly fail at getting and accuarate reading.  The article states that the technology associates each emotion with \"characteristic movements of the facial muscles\" and then uses those movements to calculate the spectrum of emotions based on their facial display. But some people show emotions in various ways, and the technology most likely cannot accomodate for the many different ways people express the same emotion. For example, if a student has a resting face that seems generally happy, the system might confuse this dazed face as a satisfied face and think that the student is happy with their lessons when they are actually confused or not paying attention. In the same way, if a student has a resting face that looks naturally sad, the system may think they are unhappy with their lessons, even if the student feels they are learning a lot. A lot of students also try to hide their emotions, like frusteration or sadness, with a happier look on their face, and even though the article states that the system can detect a \"false smile\", it cannot always be accurate as a person may be good at hiding their emotions and displaying a genuine smile. Therefore, since technology is not always accurate and because human beings are so various in the way they behave, the technology would not be useful in a classroom where it may misread a student's state of mind and lead them in the wrong path of education.  We all know where there are friends, there are foes. When you group a bunch of developing teenagers going through puberty, where emotions and hormones are swarming around, you get a sort of cesspool of emotion. Yes, at times there will be drama, fights, gossip, harassment, and many other things normal to the life of every day teens. Some may say this is a lie, but it is very well the cold hard truth. People won't always get along it's apart of the human nature, and as you're growing up you are still trying to figure out what you do or don't get along with.  Every living thing on planet earth has emotions. These emotions have been used since the beginning of time to express the feelings of the people around you. However, these emotions can be decieving. Someone could say they are happy, when really they are angry or upset. This is where the Facial Action Coding System comes into play. The FACS is a software that detects human emotion by tracking muscles in the face. For example, when you are happy, muscles in your face move up, and when you are sad, they move down, FACS tracks this and calculates your emotions. The creators of this software, Prof. Thomas Huang and Prof. Nicu Sebe are the leading experts of developing better ways for humans and computers to communicate. There are still some questions surrounding the usefulness of FACS, like what could this software actually be used for? One of the ways FACS may be used is in classrooms.  Dr. Huang also explains that \"the facial expressions for each emotion are universal\" reguardless of the desgree of expression, (D'Alto). Finally, the fear of more computer based activities is rapidly squashed by the contradiction that being more aware should envoke more human interaction, not lesson it.  With the constant evoultion of the way we learn, its not suprising that something like FACS was created. Emotions have been with everything living since the beginning of time. Before FACS, it was suprisingly difficult to read these emotions in people. Such a crucial part of our everyday lives could be easily hidden away by a fake smile or a theatre tear. But now that there is FACS helping out, looks are no longer decieving.  While there are many positives to this technology some might argue that computers cannot actually calculate human emotion. They argue that human emotion is not somehting that can or should be understood because it would ruin the entirety of feeling certain ways.  It can read a total of six emotions with some branches coming off of those emotions. The six emotions are stated in the quote,\" Eckman has classified six basic emotions - happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness - and then associated each with characteristic movements of the facial muscles.\" The machine is able to determine whether a student is in distress or not thus telling the teacher to help the student out with the problem that they are facing. The teacher would be able to help the student cope and deal with their emotional sadness or anger and tell them how to deal with it in order to assist them in getting through it. This is not the end though of what this incredible machine can do for a school.  In today's world, students are filled with many emotions, some too difficult for even parents to decode. The rollercoaster of feelings that a teenager endures in a day is confusing and complex. But with newly found technology, it may be easier now for the emotions of students' to be understood and assisted, if needed. The revolutionary Facial Action Coding System allows computers to scan and analyze the feelings of a human, alive or painted, and is a very valuable tool to comprehend student's emotional expressions.  The technology is able to identfy a human's true emotions, but that will not alter the way that person feels. ",

                "content": "In 1976 the face looked like a face. In 1998 it started to not look like a face at all. In 2001 it just looked like a rock. So i believe that it was not created by aliens but that it was just something the olanet had made itself. This has certainly got the attention of the people.  The \"Face on Mars\" is not a face. If you look at the pictures from 1976, and 1998, and 2001 and in the text it says that the photo from 2001 is the most recent photo that NASA has. It still looks nothing like a face so since the 2001 picture is the most recent it shows that it is just a natural landform. It is just a natural landform. On Mars there are natural landforms everywhere and the fade away. Here on earth natural landforms are created everyday.  On April 5, 1998, NASA's MGS flew over Cydonia, the siting of the face, to snap more picture to reveal that the Face was just a natural landform and nothing more  n paragraph 10 it says,\" ...43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo.\" This shows that the photo didn't give very compelling evidence that there was life on Mars. soon later NASA and their supporters claimed that this face is just an act of nature is because of the 1998 Global Surveyor spacecraft. This new spaceship passed over the red planet to take pictures of the \"face on Mars\". The pictures were ten times better than the last pictures of Cydonia this time. The new photos clearly showed a landform on Mars and not a man.  The author states that scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa when the face appeared. This shows that they have seen things like this before and they knew that it wasn't real, or alien like. Another example that the author proves is that Garvin said it reminded him of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. The camera on board MGS had to peer through wispy clouds to see the face and perhaps alien markings were hidden by haze. Also NASA can be hidding information about the Face. But, you can see that the Face is formed by shadows, and not an alien haze.  No matter what people believed after they saw the picture taken in 1998, the picture taken on April 8, 2001 was the one that proved to the skeptics that the Face was a naturally occurring landform.  And my explanation for that is because if they want to have a more clearer picture then they should take another one up there. And again they might even get an even bettere and bigger because of the technology we have today. It might be even in high definition so that they can see if thats actually a face or if its just a mountain with craters. But they might get me wrong and thats ok but as long as they have a better camera to explain how or what i'm right about. Like in the beginning of this article it said that they had take pictures in 1976, 1998, and in 2001 but all of those pictures are on cameras that make pictures blury and in order to see if the picture was actually a face they had to do something to make that picure clearer than it shows.  On April 5, 1998 Michael Malin and his \"Mars Orbiter Camera\" took a picture of the face. The picture was ten times sharper than the original and it proved that it was just a natural landform.  Both seem to resemble a simple mesa, a natural landform quite common on Mars. The 1998 photograph was slightly blurry, so three years later Michael Malin and his crew returned to the Red Planet, to the Cydonia region. Mr. Malin set the Mars Global Surveyor camera to maximum resolution, and snapped an excellent picture from above the Face. And, going even further, I will point out that each pixel in the 2001 photograph spans1.56 meters, as the Viking I's 1976 photo spans 43 meters per pixel. As you can see, this is a significant difference and must not be overlooked.  In conclusion, NASA is either brave or very stupid not to tell people about their \"face\", or people just want to get their word out to make other people critisized, make other people feel stupid, or they just want to feel like they are correct when they are clearly not. Therefore; This \"so called face\" is not a face, but it is just a land mark that was naturally constructed by the elements and not alien life-forms.  The \"face\" isn't any perticular shape that any man or alien would want. The landform would be shaped as a circle, square or any other simple shape, and it would not be so ridgid and cracked. If you were to look at the photo furthest to the left, you would assume that it resembled a face, but If you compair that photo to the one taken twenty-five years later, you would begin to understand that to photo was out-dated and that the camera was not as clear as the one taken later. In addition, why would an alien make a structure of a human's face.  ",

The electoral college is not based on equality because everybodys votes count differently due to supporters or electors who are pretty much the ones getting the votes. fixing the way people vote and how they vote can change the way some people feel towards the preident no matter who they are. Let the people vote for who they want and not the electors because it would make more people more open to vote than there are now.       All in all, the Electoral college has both its good things and their downfalls. As can be seen the bad out ways the good in this situation. A voters vote isn't necessarily direct because they aren't voting on a single representative, they are voting on a group of individuals in which they believe will vote for the candidate in which they choose. Also, being that the number of electors is based on a state's number of congressional represenatives it is an unequal and unfair number of electors per state. The electoral college can even cause an uproar if a tie ever falls in place because the \"tie breaker\" is left in the hands of the House of Representatives. Basically \"the electoral colleg is unfair, and irrational\" (paragraph 14) and it should be abolished because there is a great amount of mix ups and failures within the system itself.     There is pleanty of things wrong in this world, but one thing that is pretty good right now is the Electoral College. More times than not it has one winner and one loser, and rarely a tie. It makes sure that nobody is a favorite or feels like it. Also it shows things can change if something is a problem or needs fixing. The Electoral College is not perfect, but is not broken. Thank you for reading my letter, I hope you take it into concideration when deciding to keep it or not.   The electoral college has many inherint flaws that make it less desirable than a simple election by popular vote. It's only rebuttals to said flaws are weak, and provide little to no reason why the college is beneficial. So there is no real reason to have it in the first place.  The electoral college should be abolished. It has caused nothing but problems for us in the past years. From ties, to innacuracy of votes, to causing re-counts. The electoral college is not putting America in the right direction. Most people don't like change, I am one of those people. Although, this change is for the better. And it should be strongly considered in the comig years  The voters are left with an unfair outcome at almost every election because of the Electoral Collage. The votes can either be very close or the people could miss Ads or campaigns for canidates, leaving the people with nothing and confusion all over. Even if you knew what elector you voted for, you cant necessarily pick who it is your voting for and your vote could possibly get confued giving you a bad outcome. Most elections are just slid by and are just based on what ever the Electoral College thinks should happen. So please abolish the Electoral College its is irrational and is not neccessary, let the people really have a fair chance.  In conclusion,The electoral college is a unfair process that has cause presidential election to change. The best results for electing president is by the popular vote. Obviously popular votes sounds more efficient and a clean election. The winner-takes it all process counterfits the number of american citizens voting result. Eletoral college process is an extra step to the election with more problems than barely any benefits. Electoral\u00a0 college should be change and alter in to a different process with clean votes that'll actually be fair for once.     In conclusion, the Electorial College needs to be replaced with a more fair, balanced system. It has the potential to allow the electors to defy the will of the people who voted them in, invalidating the people's votes and making them pointless. It also has candates only focusing their ads and visits on the states with more votes and the states biased towards their party. Finally, it has almost all the states have a landslide \"winner-takes_all\" style of awarding electorial votes. This means if one side of electors only wins by a slim margin, the other side gets nothing, even though since they lost by a small number they clearly have a sizeable amount of voters for them. The Electorial College needs to be removed before someone takes advantage of it's serious flaws and takes the votes of the people and makes them useless.     Electoral College should be abolished because the electors may help ruin the president election and large states are not vistied or spoken to from the president other than small states. Electoral college may seem an unfair disadvantage for most voters many of their campaign that they want to win can be rather at a disadvantage or advantage depending on their electors,\u00a0 many electors may betray their campaign because they're not pubilicly held in office. Lastly the disadvantage is that many voters want to see what and how they are going to change or improve their well being, but most electors and campaigns do not visit the states that want view and know the candidates better. The electoral College should be abolished for the matter of the voter and the United States of America. In my opinion we should be allowed to vote on our own, for example instead of voting for an elector we should just vote on the type of campagin whose better and meet our daily bases needs.   the 2000 election only a glimpse of the chaos that could result from the Electoral College. The disaster factor is a strong argument against the Electoral College. Consider 1960, when Louisiana segregationists came close to replacing Democratic electors with ones who wouldn't support Kennedy (11). Also along those lines, electors are bound by nothing but obligation to vote for the candidate of their party, and sometimes change their decision upon voting. Even if it only happens occassionally, it is yet another fault in this system. ",

                "content": "After all, electoral colleges should be changed because it is better for the people so there is more of an input from smaller populated states, they will want to vote and there would be less of an ability to tie the election. Having a popular vote lets the citizens in big states that are metaphorically already \"chosen\" allows the minority vote to maybe have a chance in the office. Last but not least, it is understood that having the electoral college decreases wrong-doings, but if the elector chosen by the state changes his intentions just for himself, that gives the state no word about it.     It also means that larger states have the advantage, because they get more votes, like California (55), Texas (38), and Florida (29), while smaller states get less, such as Alaska (3), Rhode Island (3), and Hawaii (4). Just to add insult to injury, this means that larger states are more fought over by politicians, leaving smaller states practically ignored. This is unfair to people in the Dakotas or Montana have no information to base their votes on, instead just picking a canidate by mainly party affiliation. the biggest political battles are in fact fought over the biggest states, in the forms of advertisements and propaganda. Although the propaganda is truely just that: propaganda, there is some truth in them, and the voters in bigger states are more well versed in the political and practical advantages of one canidate over the other. Article 3, while defending the Electoral College, in fact condems itself, by saying that voters in so called \"swing states,\" where there is no true dominant party, are likely to be given the most information on the canidates as they battle over who will get that state's votes in the college. The same thing can be said for the bigger states, because neither politician can really afford to let the other gain the upper hand in that state. Therefore smaller states, or states that are basicly marooned on one party are ignored or disregarded as worthless and unattainable in any case, so they widthold information from them, forcing them to vote blindly in favor of whichever party they choose, which votes may be discarded anyway. With an uncensored popular vote, the political canidates will be forced to advertise for all of the united states, instead of just the bigger or indevisive states. this will also remove all of the unfair advantages from the larger states, including more information as well as an unfairly weighted voting system.  In this system, according to the second source, popular vote, which is what the majority people select, most of the time loses the election due to the Electoral System. An Example used in this source was the 2000 election with Al Gore, he had won the popular vote, but had lost the election thanks to the Electoral College. With this system in play, voters cannot control who they want to vote for and that is not how it should be. In source one, it clearly states most states have a \"winner-take-all\" type of system that awards all electors of that state to the specific candidate, which is the complete opposite of benefiting the people, because not everyone in that state wants to vote for that specific candidate. Source 3 says big states that a larger state gets more attention than a smaller state does because of the amount of votes, however some states claim they never even got to see a presidential campaign had because of how small the states was. Its is Unfair to these states which include Rhode Island, South Carolina. It takes away opportunities from these smaller states.  Some people may argue that the states know what they are doing and are cautious on who to pick  Since most of the big states already have their votes planned out on who is going to win them over, president-to-be's don't try to persuade them because they know they have those votes. Mostly they try to change the swing states, or the smaller states because they could change from Democratic to Republican during anytime in the election. If everyone had a say in the election, more people would be inclined to vote and there would be more input into who became the next 4 year leader of this nation.  Politicts have been around for centuries; politics were made to keep the peace and give everyone a fair expresion to the people. We have all herd of people in political standpoint have been corrupt, but what if our own voting system was corrupt and our votes have never made a diffrence in selecting a president by the people. When we vote for our selected president is it really going to change or make a diffence on who gets elected... right? \"of course it will make a diffrence.\" As long as your states electors dont choice by who they feel is the best fit for presidency. On another note what about the Electoral college votes. Why does one canidate always get all the electoral college votes from one state? Why cant we just revert to how many votes the canidate gets?  According to source 3, \"Knowing their vote will have no effect, they have less incentive to pay attention to the campaign than they would have if the president were picked by popular vote.\" Larger states are paid the most attention to by canidates because they will receive more votes than compared to the number of votes a smaller state would produce. This causes smaller states to have less interest in the campaign because they know they have a lesser chance of their favored canidate winning. Even more, canidates focus on swing states. Swing states are states that can be easily convinced for votes. It is important for all states to focus on the campaign so that an unworthy or unprepared canidate is not chosen for presidency, but only large and swing states are paying attention.  Electoral College should be abolished because the electors may help ruin the president election and large states are not vistied or spoken to from the president other than small states. Electoral college may seem an unfair disadvantage for most voters many of their campaign that they want to win can be rather at a disadvantage or advantage depending on their electors,\u00a0 many electors may betray their campaign because they're not pubilicly held in office. Lastly the disadvantage is that many voters want to see what and how they are going to change or improve their well being, but most electors and campaigns do not visit the states that want view and know the candidates better. The electoral College should be abolished for the matter of the voter and the United States of America. In my opinion we should be allowed to vote on our own, for example instead of voting for an elector we should just vote on the type of campagin whose better and meet our daily bases needs.   Candidates mostly pay attention to states that have more electoral votes, this causes them to pay more attention to the bigger states and leave out the smaller ones, as already argued, some states get more electoral votes than others. Another reason why this is bad is because most states will not pay attention in the election because they will not make a difference. If popular vote were to be in action, then more people and citizens will pay attention because it will be a more interesting election since more epeople have a say and the candidates will pay attention to all states. Even the bigger states with more electoral votes know that they are the ones to basically decide the election.  This nation is a nation of freedom and peace. Not for a bunch of people who are power hungry. The Electoral College is fair and equal, it is the government that is not. If the government would only change for the better then there would be no problem. This nation is still young compared to all the other countries. They have gotten all there issues taken care of, but we have not. The reason is that some of the officials are power hungry and do things to take care of themselves and not others, but some are not and they want to make this country better. Those are the ones that should stay and not the power hungry ones. They make it fair. So I strongly belive that the Electoral College should stay the same, and that the government should be the one to change. ",

They can mess up society and cause harm in more ways than it could help society. Although the car is a very unique way of showing advancement in the technological world, one would have tot look at both sides before concluding whether or not this is a good idea, and in this case it seems that the bad outweighs the good.  In conclusion, driverless cars are not a good idea. Maybe in the distant future if more problems that we are currently dealing with are resolved, but not at this time. Driverless cars are not currently safe, and will not be for many years to come. They would cost a significant amount of money, money that can be spent elsewhere for better causes, especially when we already have cars that work perfectly fine. Finally, driverless cars are not a good idea because they could cause people to forget how to drive a regular car, which could lead to a very dangerous and potentially deadly situation. There are benefits of driverless cars, however there are even more downfalls to the idea that certainly outweigh the benefits.       driverless cars would not be a good idea to implement into society because drivers could get reckless at the wheel.  driverless cars would not be a good idea to implement into society because of who would be to blame if accidents did happen.  driverless cars would not be a good idea to implement into society because of its proness to being hacked.  Another reason that driverless cars are a good idea is that they improve people's safety.  These are the reasons that I do not think driverless cars should be pursued by car companies. I do agree that they would be very cool, but they are in fact, to good to be true. With the many complications that could come up, to the lack of freedom in teens, driverless cars take away more than what they could be bringing. Instead of investing in this innovation, we should use the investments to pursue more practical products, and to continue to make what we already have, better. Driving comes with a great responsibility that technology does not have. That is why I do not think driverless cars are a good idea for the safety of our generations.            The idea of driverless cars is a great idea because the environment will benefit from it greatly and human error on the roads will become a thing of the past.  All in all, the manufacturing of driveless cars is pointless when the car isn't even really driveless. It seems more of a hazard to the economy, the safety of many, and the time of others than it does as an ensuring safe way to get around. In the case of the driveless car, the driveless car lost. There are too many negative effects for it to ever succeed.    I am against driverless cars because the cars aren't completely driverless, there will have to be new laws made for these vehicles, and there would be confusion for who to blame. The idea of driverless cars is a great idea, indeed, but there would be just too much confusion and conflict regarding these. ",

A majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the president.\" The popular vote can get tied up pretty easily, but it is a lot harder for the electoral votes to get tied up because only 270 votes are needed to elect the president.  This is reliterated when The Office of the Federal Register statees, \" Your state's entitled allotment of electors equals the number of members in its Congressional Delegation: one for each member in the House of Representatives plus two for your Senators...(Office of the Federal Register 1). In addition this means that each state will receive an opportunity to have a meaningful vote to the elections because every state has the same kinds of members being awareded to them. Each state will have a different number of members due to the size, but they will all be of equal value to the canidates. To add for support, Posner says, \"No region has enough electoral votes to elect a president\"(Posner 1). With this, all the states understand that their vote is crucial to the election and the canidates. Fortunately, the Electoral College is fair and equal to all the state's voting in the election, sometimes even more than some states know. For example, Posner states, \" Voters in toss up states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign-to really listen tp the competing candidates-knowing that they are going to decide the election\"(Posner 1).\u00a0 Ultimately, the Electoral College is the most fair way to decide and vote for a future president who will be our leader of all the citizens.  Each state gets one vote and then the electors can choose who they want for president. In source two it states that the electoral college consists of 538 electors and the most amont of elecrtoral votes is 270, in order to pick an president. Also in source two it states that the number of electors we have equals to the amount of members of congress we have. I propose a new system by only letting the American people select our president by votes counted all up by each state, for example if we didn't have have electoral college,\u00a0 then it would be a fair vote because people votes would count the number that adds up with all votes for one candidates that will oppose another candidates and there would be technically no tie it would either ,more or less, but if we still had the electoral college then the vote would not be equally fair becuse if the majority of a state for examlpe\u00a0 chose republican candidate, then that would be vague becuse some people choose democratic and there vote did not really count. but without the electoral collge, than everyones vote counts and each candidates gets vote from every one, not only electoral.  The number of entitled electors per state is based upon the members of the state's congressional delegation. \"One for each member in the House of Representatives plus two for your senators.\" (paragraph 3). This is unfair because the number of \"House\" members is based on the states overall population compared to the amount of senators. It may somehow be good for the residents who beleive their votes doesn't count becasue of the candidate's regional appeals but what about those who fear that their electors won't choose the candidate in which they favor.  When the Constitution of the United States was written our founding fathers decided on an Electoral College as the way to ellect the president instead of a direct vote. The Electoral College is a process that makes a compromise between the popular vote of the citizens and the Congressional vote. When citizens vote for president they are actually voting for a member of the Electoral College that is going to select their president, rather than the citizens voting for the president themselves. The Electoral College is made of 538 electors, the number of electors from each state varies depending on the states Congressional delegation. Washington D.C. is counted as a state for this process and alloted only three electors.  Source 1 states, \"Your state's entitled allotment of electors equals the number of members in its Congressional delegation: one for each member in the House of Representatives plus two for your Senators.\"\u00a0  Most people dont really understand what the Electoral College is, or what it is about, so let me just inform you about it a little. The Electoral College is a process that was established in the constitution and it is a strategy that we use to elect out presidents. The citizens vote for the president, but so the the electors in the Electoral College. There are over five hundred members of the Electoral College, and if a canadate wants to win presidency, he/she has to gain 270 of the Electoral College's votes. Each person running has a set of their own electors  In this case, the election would be thrown to the House of representatives, were delegates from each state would vote on the president. Since each state has only one vote to cast, a vote from a state containing 500,000 people would carry the same weight as a vote representing the opinions of 35 million. Given that many voters vote one party for president and another for Congress, the selection made by the House of Represenatives can hardly be expected to respesent the will of the people.     In the 1960 election, segregationists in the Louisiana legislature almost succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy and make it seem that a popular vote would have not gone to Kennedy. What would happen if their was a tie in the electoral vote? The case would be thrown in the House of Representatives, where state delegations vote on the president. Becasue each state counts for only one vote, a single representative from Wyoming would represent 500,000 voters, 55 representatives from California who getto represent 55 representatives would have as much say as the one from Wyoming.  In what's wrong with the electoral college, is saying that \"The most worrying prosepct is the tie in the electoral college....in that case the elction would be thrown to the H.O.R., where state delegations vote on the president.\" If this ever does happen, MAny people in the senate or house of representatives would have to vote and would have to rake on responsibilty of the as many as 500,00 voters.

Bogota, Colombia has gone into its third year of banning cars and the turnouts of the pariticipation were large, with two other Colombian cities joining and municipal authorities from other countries to view the event (Source 3). The evidence show that limiting cars wasn't opposed by the people, in fact, other countries were wanting to get in on the action. This limiting of car usage really cuts down on traffic congestion and new community projects have been established to ease the transition to alternative transportation. Heidrun Walter, mentioned in Source 1, syas that when she had her car she always tense and stressed and is happy with the change. The source also mentions that the \"swish of bicycles and the chatter of wandering children drown out the occasional distant motor (Source 1).\" This shows that the limitation of car usage greatly enchances the wellness of the community and promotes a safe and stress-free environment for the people.  Many people agree with the statment\u00a0 that without cars their lives are easier and less stressful due to the fact that they no longer have to worry about traffic jams and car crashes as well as any other dangerous event that can happen while driving. This excerpt from the third source, shows a man's reply to the event Day Without Cars that takes place in Bogota,Colombia once a year. \"'It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,' said businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza.\"(Source 3). This excerpt only furthers my point that less car usage causes people to be more calm and less worried or stressed. \"'When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,' said Heidrun Walter\" (Source 1). This quote from source 1 which discusses a suburb in Germany that is car-free. This blurb shows another example of someone who became happier without a car.  they're always tense, not using a car makes them happier, as stated by Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two (Source 1). The stress aspect of this could be due to the fact that in the most recent years, the percentage of car crashes and accidents have gone up. Many people abhor the idea of using cars because they have been in an terible accident themselves or someone close to them. Also, it can even just be all the traffic jams that occur during rush hour, which makes people late and accidents do happen. For example in Bogota, Colombia, millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated, or took buses to their designated location, to leave the streets due to traffic jams (Source 3). Since they knew that lots of their citizens were deciding not to use cars they started making uneven, pitted sidewalks into nice, smooth, replaced ones for them (Source 3).  It is no secret that morning traffic jams and 5'o'clock traffic is often enough to send any driver into a fit of unadulterated rage and what better way is there to prevent that than to simply not drive at all? Mother and media trainer, Heidrum Walter attested to this after moving into a mostly car-less community, claiming \"when [she] had a car [she] was always tense. [She's] much happier [that] way\" (Source 1). If that were not enough, businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza who participated in the Day Without Cars in Bogota, Colombia, after just a day was able to say \"it's a good oppurtunity to take away stress\" (Source 3). Just one day was enough to de-stress this man and if that does not speak wonders, one has to wonder what does. The event \"[left] the streets of [Bogota] eerily devoid of traffic jams\" (Source 3), which goes to show how stressful it was everyday, with traffic jams a common occurance. No one enjoys them, so why continue to suffer through them?  A decent amount of stress comes with owning and operating a motorized vehicle.\u00a0 You are constantly worrying about if you will be late, or if you have enough gas to make it from point A to point B.\u00a0 Children are another concern and trying to keep them safe around roads and driving by themselves.\u00a0 Limiting the use of cars can create a less stressful, and safer society.\u00a0 In Source 3 it explains that, \"Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city; uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks; rush-hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic; and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up.\"\u00a0 Lowering the use of cars can make life a little less busy because it is one thing less that you have to worry about throughout your day.\u00a0 Heidrun Walter said, in Source 1, \"When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way.\"\u00a0  When in a car, it is easy to see when the driver is stressed out. Stress accumulates with traffic jams or when someone is becoming infuriated by another driver, who is driving right in front of the other driver and going really slow. There are people who have seen there stress levels drop when they are not in or don't own a car. For instance, a community in Vauban, Germany, at least 70 percent of their residents don't own a car, while 57 percent sold their car to move there. A woman, Heidrun Walter, who is a resident there stated, \"When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way\"(Source 1). This verifies how people can get away from stress by just not having a car. In Bogota, Colombia, there is a day when automobiles are banned for a day, with the execption of buses and taxis. This day has become very popular, and is a \"good opportunity to take away stress\"(Source 3), as said by Carlos Arturo Plaza, a business man who rode a two-seat bicycle with his wife on that day. On this day millions Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work, leaving the streets free of any traffic jam, when a driver gets stressed out he most, as stated in source 3. This shows the number of people who participated in this event and also shows their, less stressful, alternative modes of transportation.  The continuing congestion and traffic jams that are among most areas of the world, create an enormous amount of stress for the people driving. Many develop road rage or irritability and are unhappy after suffering from a long ride home because of traffic. Some believe that cities should become more like Vauban, a community in Germany in which the citizens have given up their cars, because those who live there are not focused on driving and are pleased living in such a manner. Heidrun Walter, a mother who lives in Vauban, portrays her love for this car-free community when she states, \"When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way\" (Rosenthal). By living in an area with little or no use of cars, the society becomes more cheerful and has less stress to cope with. In addition, with no cars people are forced to spend more of their time outside to get from one place to another. In Bogota, Colombia there is an annual car-free day, in which anyone who does use their car has to pay a fine. Many spend their day outside walking or riding their bikes to get around and believe that the car-free day is \"a good opportunity to take away stress...\" (Selsky). As they exercise more without cars and enjoy the great outdoors, they wear bright smiles on their faces and look at things with a positive attitude.  Cars are one of the main sources for people's stress, whether it be because of car failures, others who annoy you while you drive, or the fact you can never find a parking spot.\u00a0 Heidrun Walter claims \" When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much mappier this way ( In German suburb, Life goes on without Cars 3).\" One main reason people are less tense and stress is because people do not have to constantly worry about if another car is about to hit them, if traffic is going to be to slow to get to work, or if your car is going to breakdown on you. Car's create unwanted stress that can be easily avoided. Indeed life would be very different without cars people in Bogota, Paris, and Germany have all been able to function properly without motorized vehicles.\u00a0 In fact \"70 percdent of Vauban's families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold cars to move her (In German Suburbs, Life goes on without Cars 3).\" These individuals have proven that it is okay to make a switch.  Heidrun Walter said \"When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,\" when talking about moving to a car free community. Thousands are converting to the trend of using the car less and others are cutting the use completely! Following this trend would be a large benefit to yourself and the enviornment around you.  Wrecks are things that claim the lives of people each and everyday. Some can be prevented, yet not all can. Think of how many lives are taken each day, due to wrecks because of things like congestion in big cities. Or even things such as someone behind the wheel who is stressed, and driving wrecklessly. A source from paragraph 3, states \"When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way\" Many people, get tense and stressed from the drivers around them. Limiting how much you use a car, can improve things such as stress levels. Imagine how much more at ease you would be if you constantly heard, a bicylest wizzing by you, or hearing children chattering and laughing among themselves, instead of hearing horns honking, loud motors, or even the sound of a car crash.  Roads and streets take up much more space than we think or even realize. With less cars on the road everyday and more people walking, or riding a bike, could only mean one thing; less roads and bigger sidewalks. More cities are trying to make limiting car usage a much bigger thing, \"...in attempts to make suburbs more compact...\" Source one, also states that \"In this new approach, stores are placed a walk away, on a main street, rather that in malls along some distant highway.

                "content": "In his article, \"The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong,\" Bradford Plumer specifically states that the people themselves do not vote for their desired candidate, but instead, they vote for electors who then vote for the more popular presidential candidate. The people should be the ones who vote for the president because they will be the ones who are governed by the president. The Electoral College gives no voice to the people and is considered by many to be a non-democratic way of voting and is often referred to anachronism. Today, it is a struggle to encourage people to vote and be present on election day because no one feels like their vote matters. People say that one vote doesn't make a difference and that there is no point in filling out a ballot if it has no real affect on which candidate is chosen. The Electoral College and the process it established is really just confirming these opinions. People do not feel like they are contributing because when it comes down to it, the electoral votes are the deciding votes. The Electoral College only has a little over five hundred electors that are representing the millions of regular people who show up at the polls on election day. In order to make the people feel like their opinions are being voiced and their voice is being heard, and to increase voter turnout on election day, it is imperative that the country switches over to election by popular vote.   under the electoral college system, voters vote not for president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president. a dispute over the outcome of an elecoral college vote is possible, it happend in 200 but, its less likely than a dispute over the popular vote. The reason is that the winning candidate's share of the electoral college invariably exceeds his share of the popular vote. The electoral college requires a presidential candidate to have transregional appeal.  In conclusion, the Electoral College should be replaced by the popular vote system as soon as possible. The Electoral College relies on archaic methods to make tallying votes simpler for the government, which results in problems. It's like the government is rounding the votes. The winner-takes-all method of the Electoral College can render a voter's vote completely useless, and it even allows representatives to vote for the presidential candidate that is against the voter's wills. Presidential candidates will not bother campaigning in states that are loyal to their adversary or are too small to be worth their time. While a single person's opinion might not seem important, or rounding votes seems \"easier,\" no corners should ever be cut when deciding who the leader of a nation with over 50 million citizens is, which is why the Electoral College should be replaced by the popular vote system.     In conclusion, the Electoral College seems unconstitutional, since a variety of issues can occur due to the many problems that could potentially occur. The United States should shift into a more reasonable and logical means of electing our president in our Republic, where everybody is equal. The Electoral College should no longer decide the president based on the possibility of a tie, the possibility for betrayal of trust and disputes due to how close the votes are. The system should change to where the popular opinion should\u00a0 decide on the president of the United States of America, making people believe that their vote will be fairly counted.  Overall Mr. Senator, I believe that the Electoral College should not be used to determine who becomes the President of the United States instead they should use popular vote. This being because the people are not directly voting, the candidates are just focusing on getting the votes and not on the people. And lastly because it can be considered unpredictable with the \"faithless electors\" and bais state legislatures.  Citizens' wishes will not always be equivalent to what the electors vote for. This occurs partly because of the winner-take-all system. In this system, the winner of the popular vote in an individual state wins all of the electoral votes a state has. According to the Office of the Federal Register, all but two states use this system. These two states are Nebraska and Maine. As a result of the winner-take-all system, it is possible that a presidential candidate loses the overall popular vote, but wins more electoral votes and thus wins the election. This occurance happened in the infamous 2000 election, when Al Gore won the popular vote but lost to George W. Bush by a mere five electoral votes. If the public indicated they wanted Al Gore as president, why should Bush have won due to this unfair system? It simply doesn't make sense. The winner-take-all system also results in political campaigns to focus their efforts in only certain regions. Some states very predictably vote either for the Republican candidate or for the Democratic candidate. Take Texas, for instance, which has traditionally always voted red. A Democratic candidate knows he should not focus his campaign in Texas, because he realizes his best efforts won't allow him to win the popular vote there and thus win the electoral votes. Because of the tendencies of certain states, many electoral votes are practically predetermined. The states which do not typically only vote in favor of one side are labelled \"swing states\". With the way the Electoral College works, the few states which are a toss-up carry the most weight. Presidential candidates will usually spend most of their time in these swing states, and very little time in others. For example, in the 2000 election, seventeen states were not visited by either candidate. Supporters of the Electoral College view the disproportional focus of campaigns as a positive. According to Richard A. Posner's article in favor of this corrupt system, \"The Electoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment of the Senate decreed in the Constituion...\" (21)  To conclude I belive that my state senator should remove the electoral colleges. To change the election by popular vote for the president of the United States. For the fact that voters vote not for the president but for a slate of electors. Who can always defy the will of the people. It should also be removed because its simply unfair to the voters. There votes may or may not be counted or may vote for the wrong person or oppsite party. The Electoral College is unfair, outdated, and irrational.     The President of the United States is currently determined by an electoral college. The electoral college process involves the public voting for their elector and not the main focus, the candidates. Through this, many of the states gain more power than they should, and the votes are set up as a \"Winner-takes-all\" system.  Richard Nixon, Jimmy carter, Bob Dole, and plenty of oothers think that it should change because according to a gallup poll in 2000 taken shortlyafer Al Gore he wonn the popular vote but lost the presidency dur to the quirks of the electoral college. in the Electoral College system people vote not for the prresident but for a slate of electors as i had said in the last pargrraph who in turn elect or the president. electors could be anyon not holding public office. voters sometimes control who there electors vote for. wich makes the voters sometimes get confsed about the electors wich makes them vote for the wrong candidate. In the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in the centery. in 1960 segegaters in Louisiana legslater nearly suceeddin replacing Democratic electora with new electors. So that the popular vote for Kennedy woulld not have actually gone to Kennedy. So them electors in the same vein they qould have to occasionally refuse to vote for the partys cannidate and cast a decideiing vote to who ever they please.  My first reason of why we should abolish the electoral college is because of the method it is done in.  What I mean by this is, according to Source 1:What is the Electoral College?, it says, \"Most states have a  \"winner- take all\" system that awards electors to the winning presidential canididate.\" The winner- take all system is not a fair way to elect a president becuase of its biases.

                "content": "The author supports their claim by giving numerous details and supporting his ideas.\"Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endbeavors.\" A big issue that is brought up are the harsh conditions Venus brings. \"On the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Farenheight, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet.\" Knowing this, you might think that they must stop there with their research because there's no way they can discover Venus now because it's to dangerous and harsh. That is false, \"NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray.\" Their solution is to have a vehicle hovering over Venus that would avoid the unfriendly ground conditions by staying up and out of their way. It would still be toasty but not deathly. The author claims, \" Not easy conditions, but survivable for humans.\" The author supports his claim by saying yes, the temperature is a challenge they will face, but NASA has one particular compelling idea for sending humans to study Venus, and they will continue to challenge themselves and find solutions to these conflicts they face.  To illistrate, \"...human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors\" (8). The author explains how humans are naturally curious, and how this curiosity often times leads them to dangerous situations. Studying Venus has its dangers, but it is no different. Also stated, \"Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation\" (8). The author is promoting curiosity because it leads us to new things. Curiosity can overcome the fear of danger when exploring Venus to help us learn new things about the planet. To summarize, the power of curiosity in people is something the author uses to support their opinion of Venus being worth it to explore.  Secondly, the author uses the point of human curiosity to support the idea that Venus is a worthy pursuit.  The author does not suport his ideas well, because he draws the reader away from the topic many times, he doesn't support his thesis very well, and the evidence he does bring up are opinions or assumptions. The author provides to much on the \"danger\" aspect of it, and he should focus more on the \"why\" aspect of his idea . So, it would be best if he looked over his essay and ,with his thesis in mind, start over from scratch.  Although many people believe that the author doesn't support this idea well, the author provides researched evidence and past experiences all throughout the passage to support this idea.  Finally, the supporting evidence that the author did bring up, weren't very factual or even well thought out.  In \"The Challenge of Exploring Venus\" the author supports Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presnts through his analysis of hovering, silicon carbide, and mechanical computers. He supports his ideas with evidence and also the analysis he has with his knowledge by research. He uses facts, and not a lot of opinions to express his ideas and belief that Venus is a worthy pursuit. He colcudes his argument that humanity's travels on Earth and beyond should never even be limited by threats of dangers or doubts. Without that, knowledge will be expanded and fuel the innovation of the human world and beyond.  The author did not make it extremly obvious as to what he was truly trying to convey. If he would been more clear and less contradictive, then it would have been more obvious that he supports the idea that Venus is worthy of being explored. Also, it would have been easier to understand the point he was trying to put across if he would have stayed on topic throughout the article. The message of the article should be obviously supported by the author.       Lastly, the author supports their idea by telling us how we are going to uncover more information without loosing more.  Venus used to be covered in oceans and supported life. Additionally, Venus still has features that are similar to Earth's such as a rocky sediment with valleys, mountains, and craters. Insight into the Venusian landscape would further allow astronomers to determine how closely related Earth and Venus were. The author also states that humans should not be limited by their fear to go out and explore. In the final paragraph of the article, the author describes how human curiosity will lead humans into many intimidating expidentures. However, the author believes that travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited simply due to danger, and humans should travel as far as their innovation will take them. ",

                "content": "Some may argue that no region has enough electoral votes to elect a president but regions do have the power to swing an election in an enourmous way. An effect of the winner take all system is candidates not going to certain states if they know they can not win it. This can basically stop some voters from wasting time and voting because they may feel there personal vote would make no difference. In the 2000 election \"17 states did not see candidates at all.\" according to Bradford Plumer. How could somebody possibly feel engaged in an election if whoever is running finds there vote unimportantant to them winning the election.  The canidates would have to campaign in every state rather than just the \"swing\" states which are people that have not yet decided which way they wanted to vote. the cenidates dont campaign in a state if they know that they have no chance of winning the electoral votes in that state. During the 2000 election a remarkable seventeen states did not see the campaign one time nor did the people in the 25 largest media markets see a campaign ad whether it be on t. v., in the newspaper, or over the radio. If the president was elected by popular vote than every state would be considered a swing state.  This is why swing states are so important to the canditates, they know that the chances of them winning the votes in the other party's states are almost impossible, so they must gather all of the votes they can from the states that are known for their swing-like tendencies. It also goes the other way, each candidate trusts that their own party's states will vote for them, so there is no need to waste the money and campaign. Unless its the primary elections, candidates don't typically campaign where they know that the votes are all but set in stone. It's like going grocery shopping, if you know that you are allergic to peanut butter and you already have all the jam you need, you will only go for the special bread that everybody fights for right? The candidates are the same, they don't go after what they already have and what they can't have, only what they might earn, or else it's just a waste of money, so nobody should be able to complain about a candidates campaigning.  Some people don't even bother voting due to the fact that their vote will not contribute to their favored candidate's election. This happens often when a democratic voter lives in a republican state, and vice versa (source 3)  In large states, where this a majority of either republican or democrats, voters may think that if they are in the minority, and the other party will surely win the election, what's the point of voting. If there was no Electoral College, the votes that they put in could contribute to the greater pool of that parties voters, while with Electoral College the votes are pointless and basically disapear. That, to me, is robbing the citizens of the U.S. of thir right to vote. According to Richard A. Posner, the Electoral College restores some of the weight that the large states hold in a presidental election. However, the large states may not have all of one party and those other votes can really make a difference.  If one wanted to, an elector can completely disregard the decision of the voters and choose who they want. Considering the ratio of electors in some states to people, it seems completely non-democratic for the votes of some to be more important than the wants of the common people. Some start to feel that they shouldn't vote because their one vote wouldn't have the power to change anything, and wouldn't even ensure the election of the president they want. Another thing that lowers the morale is the absence of candidates in states that can't be won very easily. If a candidate is pretty sure he can't win over a state, he won't visit it because it wouldn't be worth his time. He also wil prioritize large states over small ones because they have more electoral votes. All of these can make a state or person feel as if the election isn't really in their hands, and when people feel like their vote doesn't matter, they don't vote.  If there is a tie in the in the electoral vote \"the election would be thrown to the House of Representatives\" (paragraph 12). This is an unfair method also becasue now there's only one vote per state and some states have a higher population than others which can and will cause contreversy in the public. \"The pressure, which would greatly complicate the presidential election process, may be redcued\" (patagraph 22) but it still doesn't reduced the fact that swing voters can cause catastrophe within the electoral voting process. This is because they are the most targeted voting areas due to their reputations as the \"most thoughtful voters\".  Because of the \"winner-take-all system in each state\", the candidates don't take time to go to other states that they know they will lose, they only really focus on the \"swing\" states. For example, during the 2000 campaign, seventeen statesdidn't see the candidates in their state at all, also 25 of the largest media markets had not seen a single campaign ad from a candidate. Also it's unfair because voters don't really know who to vote for because they see no campaign ads and candidates don't show up to their state and tell them what he/she is running for. That's why the Electoral College is unfair to voters of the presidential election.  But some people don't really know what they are voting for in election which is why the Electoral College is the way to go. Also people complained with the \"winners take all method\" some candidates don't go to certain states and only focus on the swing states. In the 2000 campaign seventeen out of fifty states didn't see the candidates. But the candidates didn't go to those states since they knew they had no chance of winning those states and they needed to focus on the swing states to make sure they win the election. Many people do call the Electoral College an anachronism, but it doesn't need to stick in the past, it needs to be kept in the present and in the future.  According to Source 2, \"state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors, and... those electors could always defy the will of the people.\" The defenders could be completely indifferent about the voters choices, or situations where swing states are borderline one party or another, and the Electoral College allows a limited selelction of people to make the final decision of millions (Source 1). The ballots that we vote in don't even effect the results of the election. It is as if these elections are trying to illude citizens from the fact that the only votes that contribute to the adoption of a new president are the electoral votes. Why bother letting us vote for a president, if only the defenders get to make the decisions? ",

Unlike Earth, Venus has an atmosphere that is \"almost 97percent carbon dioxide\" with a surface temperature averaging \"over 800 degrees Fahrenheit\" and an \"atmospheric pressure [that] is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet\"(Paragraph 3). Due to these extreme differences in temperature, pressure, and air content, Venus would be fairly inhospitable for humans. Usually when NASA launches missions to other planets they are trying to find alternatives habitats for the human race in the event that they cannot survive on Earth. If humans will not be able to withstand the conditions of Venus it is no longer a good option; therefore, it is not worth looking into since the author provides evidence that Venus would not be a useful living environment in the future.  Well, first of all, The atmospere of Venus has a THICK layer of carbon dioxide the covers 98% of the planet, in which makes Everything a much hoter place,but, to top it of with the atmosphere problem, the clouds in there have highly corrosive sulfuric acid. If we some how passes through the atmosphere, than we'll face ANOTHER problem with the ground. Since Venus is the second planet from our sun and with all those carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, the surface ground temperature is over 800 DEGREES FAHRENHEIT. In which with the surface and the atmosphere, it could basically melt many types of metal with no problem. Another Problem is that the atmosphereic preassure is 90x greater than our Earth, with that much preassure could easily crushed a submarine that is built to surrvive the deeper end of the ocean. From what we gather small information from our space craft, the geology of venus pretty much have erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lighting strikes.  but in reality, Earth and Venus are very differnet. Earth is much safer in terms of temperature, pressure, and gas compaired to Venus. Venus has a blanket of gas that covers it that is, \"almost 97 percent carbon dioxide.\" Plus, on its surface, \"temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit.\" with the level of carbon dioxide and the ragging heat that it has, nothing is safe for long on Venus, especially humans. He does state that several spacecrafts have attempted to land on Venus, and only lasted a few hours, but he doesnt state what happened to them. most people would guess that they just melted entirely because of the extreme heat, which is most likely what happened, but we don't know for sure.  According to the article, 97 percent of the atmosphere of Venus is carbon dioxide, which is unable to be breathed by humans. Another detail the article states is that on the surface of the planet, the average temperatures is over eight hundred degrees. The climate and enviorment of Venus is too dangerous for exploration. The planet does not hold nowhere near a safe enviorment for people or even machine.  Venus has features such as mountains, craters, and even valleys that are also seen on Earth. According to the article, its atmosphere is 97% carbon dioxide with temperatures averging 800 degrees Fahrenheit. Atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than Earth with can crush nearly anything that tries to reach its surface and even liquefy metals. The second paragraph discussed how spacecrafts in the past barely lasted a few hours and since there hasn't been a spacecraft sent there in more than three decades. This evidence shows that despite the success of reaching Venus, we are not even close to even slowly progressing and fixing smaller issues with spacecrafts traveling there and back to Earth.  There are many dangers on Venus, including sulfuric acid rain and an atmosphere of nintey seven percent carbon dioxide. Hovering over it would be useless. In paragraph six, it states, \"... peering at Venus from a ship orbiting or hovering safely far above the planet can provide only limited insight on ground conditions because most forms of light cannot penetrate the dense atmosphere, rendering standard forms of photography and videography ineffective.\" This states that by hovering on top of the planet, they can't learn anyting they don't already know.

                "content": "Later, in paragraph 5, the author mentions how NASA (The National Aeronautics and Space Administration) has \"one particularly compelling idea for sending humans to study Venus.\"  The author says NASA has an idea on how to send humans to study Venus, \"...possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray\" (Paragraph 5). The ship would hover above, avoiding the dangerous conditions by remaining away from it. Allowing the scientists to be close enough to study some elements of Venus, and to have more context on how to understand it more, without a human possibly dying. To further support this, the author states, \"...hovering safely far above the planet can provide only limited insight...\" (Paragrah 6). The author is aware that hovering is not the most effectove technique, but he supports the idea by hinting it will still be worth it because information can still be gathered, despite the limits.  When discussing the exploration of Venus, most people are turned off by its reputation as a dangerous and challenging planet for humans to study. While the author doesn't stray away from these harsh extremities, they make sure to prove how these details seem insignificant and how safe travel can still be executed. The author thoroughly describes the plan provided by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) to allow astronauts to float above the fray and avoid the hazardous conditions. They provide specific qualities of the plan, such as the air pressure being close to the sea level on Earth, the abundance of solar power, and the containment of radiation, to prove how humans would be kept in a safe atmosphere. They even provide a real world connection between NASA's possible solution and a blimp-like vheicle hovering around the ground to make it easier for the audience to understand. The author combats the speculaiton of Venus being too dangerous to explore in order to further support the idea of it being a worthy pursuit.  When explaining NASA's ideas on sending humans to Venus, the author states, \"NASA\u0092s possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray.\" This provides evidence that shows what a solution is to avoiding some of the difficulties that occur when trying to explore Venus. The author was able to support his idea throught the use of NASA and it's research. The passage continues to come up with a plan on the best way to float above Venus when the author says, \"At thirty-plus miles above the surface, temperatures would still be toasty at around 170 degrees Fahrenheit, but the air pressure would be close to that of sea level on Earth.\" This factual evidence that is included ensures that the author is supporting this idea to the fullest of his potential. Researched and factual evidence that is provided all throughout the passage shows how the author supports this idea thoroughly and well.  From the example stated earlier, regaurding the extreme conditions in Venus, the author was able to provide a logical solution to the weather without using any opinions. The author wrote,\"NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow sceintists to float above the fray.\" The author then goes onto describe NASA's plan in full depth, and going into fine detail about the floating contraption that would suspend the astronauts safely above the harsh atmosphere of Venus. They then state, \"Not easy conditions, but survivable for humans.\" The author is displaying a solution for the conditions, and even the minor flaws it has. The author going into detail about the solution for the extreme conditions in Venus and even conceding a bit when saying, \"Not easy conditions but survivable for humans,\" helps argue their point. They affectively refuted the counter-arguements by using factual evidence in their rebutal, and deemed themselves trustworthy by the opposing side by even conceding slightly on a few issues.  This furthers the point more that NASA is also trying to send humans to go visit and study our planet's \"twin\". The author then goes on, proceeding to help our visualization of NASA's plan, telling the reader that NASA would not directly put humans on Venus's surface, but rather have them float in a blimp-like vehicle above the startpoint of Venus's weather and \"avoid the unfriendly ground conditions by staying up ad out of their way.\" The author lastly pointed out how, even with the toasty weather, Venus' surface is still survivable for humans, even though it's not full of easy conditions.  The author states, \"NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray.\". Stating ways that Venus can be studied with people not being put in danger helps get the authors point across. The article also touches on how floating above the surface could keep those studying the planet safe. Temperatures would still be high, but nothing the spacecraft couldn't handle, the air pressure would be like how it is on Earth at sea level, soloar power would be bountiful, and radiation would be no higher than the levels on Earth. The text then states, \"Not easy conditions, but survivable for humans.\". Although this would not be an easy job, it is possible to study Venus safely. The details used in this paragraph help convey the authors point that studying Venus can be done safely and that it should continue to happen.  When talking about something as dangerous as exploring another planet, it is easy to see that our Earth bound technology simply cannot do the job. in paragraph 5 of the article, the author describes an idea that was thought up by \"The National Aeronautics and Space Administartion\". This idea is to have humans 30 or so miles above Venus for exploration. The author claims how this would be beneficial in keeping humans safe from the Venusian landscape. However, The author does not support this idea well, as he goes on to say how not much exploration can be done from there, and the conditions would still be extremely dangerous but \"survivable\". Also in paragraph 7, the author explains how NASA is working on other approaches to study Venus. He explains how they are working on some simplified electronics, made of silicon carbide, that have been testedd in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface. This may sound like a good thing, but it is far from one. This is because the author finsihes by saying that the electronics lasted only three weeks. If a computer can't withstand Venus's conditions longer than three weeks, I am very doubtful that a human can. This proves my point that our technology is far too inadvanced for such a task like exploring another planet. Therefore supporting my claim that the author did a poor job in supporting this idea.  This, in turn, aids in convincing readers that might have originally disgareed with the author due to the fact that Venus' \"conditions are fare more extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth; such an environment would crush even a submarine assustomed to diving to the deepest parts of our oceans and would liquefy many metals,\" (3). The author, after making this counterclaim, refutes it by talking of some solutions to this ever-looming issue: \"NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions of the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray. Imagine a blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the roiling Venusian landscape,\" (5). The author talks of how the air pressure, temperature and radiation would all be survivable for humans. Some, such as the air pressure 30 miles above Venus, would be almost identical to Earth at sea level.  They are considering a blimp-like vehicle that would float above the suface of Venus to meet the challenges presented. This blimp would avoid the poor conditions of the Venusian landscape by floating some thirty miles above the surface. Conditions around the blimp would still be slightly hot, but the pressure and toxicity would be similar to that on Earth. These conditions are not ideal, but they would be sufficient enough to study Venus further. Another one of NASA's ideas is to use mechanical computers to study Venus. These mechanical computers do not require electronics, and they would be more resistant to the poor conditions of the surface. These new innovations in the study of Venus is what makes the dangers tolerable and the study worthy. ",

                "content": "First, voters can walk into the booth and \"...get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate\" (Plumer 10). Not every voter is educated on exactly how the electors and candidates are represented on the ballot and that may lead to an accidental win. On top of this misconception, almost decietfully, an elector promised to a candidate can change their vote at a moments notice(Plumer 10). Even Posner who writes for the electoral college admitted that it is possible, and he claims that it is \"rare\";however, it has happened before in 1960 (Plumer 11), and not even Posner can control the actions of an elector, legally anyway. Also, when a candidate wins a popular vote, which is the true mind of the people, that candidate still may not win the electoral vote, overall, loosing the election. This happened just a few years back in the 2000 election between President Bush and Gore(Posner 16).All in all, the electoral college does not represnt the people.  Students have the tendency to not to things if told by another individual, but when the idea is introduced by oneself, the individual is more inclined to do it.  The Hunger Games is a novel that displays a similar effect; being based off of a numerous amount of decisions that could either end up in an individual's death, or survival, a certain scene in this book depicts the choosing of a weapon. The main character, Katniss, chooses a bow and arrow, being a weapon that the character has a great strength in and has a higher chance in succeeding with it. Having the ability to choose and having a personalized approach to the task makes one's task more likely to be completed with great excellence, especially if the individual personalizes the project to aid their strengths rather than their weaknesses. A teacher would not be able to identify a student's weaknesses, resulting in a weaker result than anticipated.  Online learning accommodates students with disabilities as well as students with injuries that may prevent them from easily leaving their homes. It is unfair that our education system would require that they come to school when they can learn the same, or potentially more information from home. Recently, it has become clear that online learning is feasible for an entire school. Take for example, schools in Italy or South Korea. These countries have temporarily closed their schools until April in order to better combat the novel corona virus, COVID-19. That said, the schools are still holding lessons online where attendance is taken and students are given the same education by the same teachers, only through a computer screen. If it is feasible for other nations to accommodate for their students during a health epidemic then surely we can also implement a similar program for our students during times of peace. Furthermore, we can not, both morally and legally, allow for our disabled students to receive a sub par\u00a0education than their peers. That is a disservice not only to them but the moral foundation and integrity of the community as a whole. Similarly, students with mental illnesses like depression or anxiety are more likely to be productive and learn in an online setting than they are in the classroom  While I was in the Seagoing Cowboys program I made nine trips it was the most of any Seagoing Cowboy it was great. I saw so many amazing places I thought I would never be able to see because I was just a normal person in my town. I saw Europe and China while I was in the program it was a great experience for me as a almost adult. I also had the advantage of taking a gondola ride in Venice,Italy, it was the city with the streets of water. I also had a awesome chance at touring the excavated castle in Crete and marveled at the Panama Canal on my way to China in the Seagoing trip. You should join it so you can see all those amazing places I just stated to you that I have seen because of this amazing experience in the Seagoing Cowboys. Another reason you should join it is because if you are almost 18 and you do not want to get military drafted then join this, they count it as your service or they did for me which means they will for you. Another one is after the animals get dropped off and we are going back with no animals we get to play amazing games in the stalls that the animals were in like baseball and volleyball, we also played table-tennis tournaments or even boxing.  These are all the amazing things i got to do and see, you could see and do them to if you join Seagoing Cowboys.  hovering  Projects help the teacher get a better understanding of what the child may need help with in order to get better at the subject and/or to pass their upcoming Standards Of Learning test.  There is a boy at my school that we are going to call Generic_Name. Generic_Name does not understand the WWI subjets in his history class. He's been doing his class and homework, been paying attention, he's been writing his notes, but he still does not understand the subject. He's asked his teacher for extra help and has recieved it. While his knowledge for the unit is growing, he still just barely passes his Standards of Learning test with a 401. Over the summer, his school required all students to make up their own project about anything they may have learned. At first he did not think it was going to help him but he decides to give it a try anyway. Generic_Name decides that if he has to learn about something over summer, he might as well learn about something he's been having trouble with. He completes his project with just a month left of summer and now has a better understanding of the war for his next year of highschool.  In Pre-Advanced Placement World History, students were required to plan, create, and execute an entire project based off of a topic of their choice relating to world history and present it to the class. It was expected that students would create said project at an Advanced Placement level skill set, that did not go as planned. Students would come into class during work days and do absolutely nothing, treating the block like a study hall, and when it came time to present projects, they had next to nothing, or something that could be done by a sixth grader. Students did not take the assignment seriously and could not be trusted to create projects or assignments on their own. When asked why the poor outcome of the project, students protested with arguments of how it was their assignment to design and how it was unfair of teachers to judge them on their skill set for that even though the real reason was them slacking off to still get a grade; therefore, it is out of question whether or not students should be able to create assignments for themselves, let alone be trusted with the task.  The main extracurricular activities that people partake at my school are plays and clubs where you can compete in, such as Model United Nations, debate club, Science Olympiad, and many others. At my school with over 1,000 students, only about 100 decide to join these clubs. These clubs only appeal to certain people that enjoy academics. If you're interested in things related to sports, my school does not have much to offer for you. When my sister was in middle school, about 7 years ago, they had very few clubs. They had 3 official clubs. Our mom made her choose a club to participate in. All that she could choose from was debate club, chess club, and homework club.  She had little to no interest in doing any of these clubs that she thought were boring and dumb. She ended up doing chess club, but she ended up hating it immensely. She said that everyone was better than her and she didn't even know how to play. This all happened because she was forced to pick an activity from three, horrible sounding, activities. This all would not have happened if no one had made her do an activity she despised. The same thing will end up happening to many children if the schools make them participate in activities they don't wish to do. Kids doing something that they don't want to do will end up with them being unhappy, which will end up in a negative learning environment.  Listening to different ideas may inspire you to tweak you decision. When I had just moved into a different house, I was presented with an age old teenage dilemma: how to decorate my room? Consulting with my parents, sister, friends, and my wise pet dog, I settled on a blue comforter and yellow walls. However, when sometimes you've strained your brain but no solution has been thought up, the presented advice may end up being the one you pick. In the book  Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,  Harry Potter has no idea how to contact Sirius Black. Luckily for him, his friends do. With their help, a plan was hatched with the involvement of invisible gas and breaking into the headmaster's office, all things he wouldn't have thought of himself. My grandmother's saying, \"Our brains are crazy in different ways,\" in this case, is\u00a0an extremely accurate expression.  World renown author of several New York\u00a0Times awarded self-help books, doctor, and psychiatrist, Leonard Steigerwald explains, \"Getting involved in clubs, sports, and other extracurricular activities can not only boost your physical health, but mental too.\" Steigerwald is stating the obvious, when students participate in sports, or even a poem writing club, they are staying physically, and mentally active. Being around other people can also help keep you mentally healthy. A recent news story even further investigates this topic, New York resident, Flynn Engstrom, was visiting a relative in Colorado when he got lost on a hike. He was missing for a month and six days and when the police found him, he was in a desperate state. He was so happy to see people that he began to cry uncontrollably. He remembered, \"I was longing to see humans again. I barely had food, or clean water and in my weak mental state, I began to imagine things,\" he shuddered, \"Horrible things that I had convinced myself were real. Seeing those officers, [I] felt my sanity pouring back into my mind.\" Although this story is quite an extreme example. If students are just sitting at home all day after school\u00a0on their phones, their confidence and motivation to do anything will begin to dwindle. ",

                "content": "Lastly, America is known for being obese and cars support this idea. Cars make it easy for someone to get places without putting any physical work into it. Cars encourage people to be lazy  We as a species are very passionate and thrive off of compassion. Studies have shown that this current generation is statistically the most depressed it has ever been. Connecting studies show that this is due to majority of millennials\u00a0feeling lonely due to the inability to communicate properly with others. This is due to the over usage\u00a0of technology to communicate rather than face to face interaction. Most people when asked when they have talked to others in person answer with either in school or in a place of business. We can't revert the effects technology has had on society but we can surely stop it from getting worse. Implementing distance learning would only cut off a form students from getting an already stagnant amount of social reaction that is needed. Thus leading us to an even more depressed society.  Humans now live in a world where technology is accessed from all parts of the world. They are at a point where one does not need to be at the same place, or even country, to communicate. In some countries, a small number of businesses have even used technology to their advantage, and allow their workers to have the choice to work at home. However, when it comes to school, it is very different in the sense that students can be very limited when it comes to quality education and resources, which is important for a growing child.  In our world today, technology has influenced the daily lives of millions. A rising debate is whether the majority of students should be able to take classes online. With technology at the tip of our hands, it can be possible for this idea to become a reality. However, the question remains if this idea of schooling is as effective as traditional public or private schooling. I think technology plays a big role in our education today.  This process is too old to keep up with the third largest population in the world  In our society, where technology is constantly improving and the need for better education is always increasing, our country's demand for better schooling with the use of technology is exponentially growing. Online schooling has become more and more possible as well as necessary with the growing rates of both children in need of schooling as well as the demand for better school conditions.  Younger generations of people in our modern world are becoming increasingly attuned to smart technology,with developments such as the smartphone, smart watch, etc. spreading throughout the nation. The introduction of a driverless car would further stimulate this already existing dependency, which could lead to problems down the road.  It's a common known fact that America has problems with obesity. Making kids do community service would definitely take time off of children's clock that they could be doing active activities like working out or playing a sport. This would increase obesity rates in America even more, causing the life span of children in this Country to shrink.  One of the largest issues for parents in today's world is trying to get their children away from the computer, television, and cell phone. Technology has lessened the need for toys and books, since children entertain themselves with games on their tablets or books they download also on the tablet. But cars play a big part in this. When a person first gets a car, he/she feels free. You feel like the world is yours because you can go anywhere. But the problem is that people become less social with cars. Instead of going to play a sport with some friends, most people would rather drive somewhere else. It is also the reason the United States is ranked second in country with the most overweight people, vehicles are so unexpensive here that anyone is able to purchase a car and drive to their destination instead of riding a bicycle or skateboard and getting some real exercise. \"Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city; uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks\" (Selsky 28). This also shows the improvement on the cities' sidewalks and the increase of people attending parks. Without cars, the streets look better and people recieve more exercise.  An example of this can be observed on a daily basis: with the simple accessibility of smart phones, it is now engraved in our culture that using technology to opt out of social situations is acceptable and more commonplace than ever before. This is because our long-term\u00a0un-moderated exposure to technology and its tendency to distract us from meaningful relationships with the people around us, is used as an excuse to limit our own social development. As a technologically-dependent and ever-evolving 21st century society, it would be unrealistic to propose that we halt the development of new technology as a means to preserve basic human interaction. Because these social habits are nearly irreversible on a global scale, an isolated, 100% digitized school environment would only promote the social debilitation of today's adolescent student body. ",

Despite having a lot on your plate, you are now required to alter your weekly schedule in order to comply.  The principal should not force all students to participate in at least one extracurricular activity  Extracurricular activities have been a controversial topic of discussion for decades. Parents, teachers, students, and principals have felt the need to express their opinion on the implementation of extracurricular activities. I attend Generic_School, a place where students have many extracurricular activities to choose from, all of which take place after the school day is over. Some choose to attend and others choose to abstain. I partake in them occasionally, but I tend to go home once the final bell rings. That was before my principal decided that all  Generic_School students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity, whether it be sports, yearbook design, student council, or something else. This decree has denied the freedom of choice to not only me, but hundreds of other students at my school with regards to extracurricular activities.  If my principal ever decided to make students participate in an extracurricular activity, I would agree with their decision. Joining certain extracurricular activities can bring many benefits to students' lives and open up more opportunities for them in the future. Think about all the things you could learn through extracurricular activities.  \"SCORE! Three points to the Wildcats,\" an announcer exclaims. The crowd goes absolutely wild, and the players feel proud about their effort. Basketball is only one of the many amazing and exciting extracurricular activities students have the privilege\u00a0to pick from. There's a variety to what's available, from art to softball to helping produce the school yearbook. Each of those activities are creative, entertaining, and helpful one way or another. In addition, our principal has decided that all students should take part in at least one extracurricular activity. As a result, some students are complaining and disapproving about this decision while others, such as me, think this is an opportunity for students to have a incredible time doing whatever activity they choose.  If a principal made every student engage in an extracurricular activity, I would disagree. I do not think students should be forced to do certain activities  Adding the rule that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity would be a fantastic way to make sure that students are getting involved with their school.  However, the specific decision of the principal should be changed as students may already participate in extracurricular activities not provided by the school.  For example, one may take piano lessons with a private teacher, or play on a travel soccer team with no association to the school. By forcing these students to have to pick up another extracurricular activity that is provided by the school, they may become overwhelmed with trying to manage their busy schedules. Then, all of the positive attributes of physical activities fall apart. This reason is why the decision of the principal should be changed so that only students who do not participate in any extracurricular activity of any kind will be required to take one. Otherwise, there will be drawbacks to the principal's otherwise good intentions. ",

You still are in control just that you choose somebody he/her is not likely to change his or her mind and vote for the exact person you want he or she to vote for. It stated in the article that \"Each candidate running for president in your state has his or her own group of electors. The electors are generally chosen by the candiate's politcal party.\" I say that if the candidate political party chooses the electors then they must be good and the party must be sure the elector won't change his mind out of no where.  If i was to be voted for president i would like to be voted by Electoral College because , electoral college is not voted for the presidents it is voted for the electors , who in turn elect the president . In conclusion , each candidate running for president in your state has thier own group of electors.  As said in the article, \"What Is The Electoral College?\", \"The Electoral College process consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for President and Vice President, and the counting of the electoral votes by Congress.\" That is a huge amount of work but that is what keeps the elections well organized. Each candidate running for President in a state has their own group of electors. After each election, the governor of your state prepares a certificate presenting all of the candidates that ran for your state. As stated in the article by the Office of the Federal Register, \"The Certificate of Ascertainment also declares the winning presidential candidate in your state and shows which electors will represent your state at the meeting of the electors in December of the election year.\" The Electoral College is what mantains everything professional.  In the electoral college voters aren't essentially voting for a president but they are voting for a group of electors who will then elect a president. The electors can be picked in many different ways. Sometimes they are they are picked at state conventions, they can be picked at state party's central committe, or sometimes the presidental canidate picks them themselves according to Bradford Plumer (source 2).  According to source one, \"What Is The Electoral College?\", each political party has it's own set of electors that equal the amount of congressional delegates per state. Usually each state has a \"winner-take-all\" method, so the presidential candidate that gets majority in your state will get all of the electors that represent their party, not just most of them. This is beneficicial to the outcome of the election becuase it makes the ability for a candiate to get majority vote much simpler. There is less of a possibility of a tie, or an outcome where no candidate wins. Source 3, \"In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep out despised method of choosing president\", states that \"even a very slight plurality in a state creates a landslide electoral-vote victory in that state...\" , therefore allowing the candidate to secure all votes to their side, instead of having the votes divided on the line of majority rule, and causing rifts between Electoral College voters.   In Source 2 Plumer declares, \"faithless electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party's canidate\". With this method of selection for our country's president, the vote is never certain. The slate of electors that the people essentially vote for may or may not stick to the original plan. This ties back into people losing hope that their vote will not matter because they trust the electors to vote their canidate into office, when the electors could go either way. Another key point is, the canidates may not campaign in states that have a lower number of electoral votes. In Source 1 the Office of the Federal Register also asserted, \"Most states have a 'winner-take-all' system that awards all electors to the winning presidential canidate\". Due to the Electoral College system being based off population some states have more of a say than others. Whenever a state decides their votes for Electoral Colleges the state typically contributes every vote it has to one canidate. When this occurs the state's people may be misrepresented.  Not one region or state has enough electoral votes to elect a president (Par 19 and 21).\u00a0 This is a good thing because canidates pay equal attention to all of America's people.\u00a0 Also, in the Electoral College, not every state has the same amount of electoral votes because every state has a different population size.\u00a0  The author shadows in Source 1: paragraph 7 that \"Most states have a \"winner-take-all' system that awards all electors to the winning presidential canidate. However, Maine and Nebraska each have a variation of \"proportional representation.\" The thing is that with a popular vote system you would not have to worry about a winner-take-all and states that have a different system than the other states. Just let the people decide and everything will be easy and fair.  This is reliterated when The Office of the Federal Register statees, \" Your state's entitled allotment of electors equals the number of members in its Congressional Delegation: one for each member in the House of Representatives plus two for your Senators...(Office of the Federal Register 1). In addition this means that each state will receive an opportunity to have a meaningful vote to the elections because every state has the same kinds of members being awareded to them. Each state will have a different number of members due to the size, but they will all be of equal value to the canidates. To add for support, Posner says, \"No region has enough electoral votes to elect a president\"(Posner 1). With this, all the states understand that their vote is crucial to the election and the canidates. Fortunately, the Electoral College is fair and equal to all the state's voting in the election, sometimes even more than some states know. For example, Posner states, \" Voters in toss up states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign-to really listen tp the competing candidates-knowing that they are going to decide the election\"(Posner 1).\u00a0 Ultimately, the Electoral College is the most fair way to decide and vote for a future president who will be our leader of all the citizens.  The canidates hold off on campaigning in states they already know they have dominated the votes in, because there is no one region that can elect a president. This makes voter feel inferior, and discourage them from \"wasting\" their time voting. If we use the majority of votes way to establish the new president, it is more likely that they will decide to vote once again, since they feel as if their opinion once again matters ",

                "content": "Also, many states may not even see the future president at all, like in the 2000 election where the candidates did not even go once and talk in seventeen states. This leads to a poor democracy because voters in these states will surmise that if the president will not bother to visit their state, they shouldn't bother on making an educated decision when voting, or may choose to not vote at all. In a election by popular vote, presidents will have to make greater strides in getting the people's votes and citizens will then have more of an impetus in learning more about their country's government and politics.  According to source 3, a supporter of the Electoral College, \"Voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election....\" This should not be the case when voting. Voters should research their choice as if the election relied completely on them. But instead, there is a system in place where somebody's vote can be rendered completely useless in not multiple ways! For example, if a state already has their majority of citizens voting for president A, if somebody votes for president B it will be as if they didn't vote at all! Even in a case where the state is completely 50:50 on who to give the electoral votes to, if the last person votes for president A, tipping the majority in his favor, according to source 2, \"... those electors could always defy the will of the people,\" and end up voting for President B. The Electoral College is an anti-thesis to democracy, because a citizen's vote can be rendered completely pointless at multiple points.  It would then go to the House of Representatives, who might not even have the want of the people in mind. Since most of the time Congress has a party that makes up a majority of it, it would be very unfair to allow them to pick the president. It's also possible that even if a majority of the people vote for a president, the electoral votes elect the other candidate instead, like what happened to Al Gore in 2000. An election like this just has too many holes and pitfalls to be efficient. The holes need to be repaired before we can actually use this as our primary way to select a president, or else we're setting ourselves up to have problems in the future.  Everyone would get to put in their opinion on who should be the president of the United States. I think that if everyone was to be able to individually vote for their president, there would be less chaos and arguements about the election and also the new president.\u00a0But,\u00a0it is possible that the winner of the electoral vote won't win the national popular vote. But, it is very rare. Some people don't bother voting because of the fact that their vote will have no effect. They have less incentive to pay attention to the campaign than they would have if the president were picked by popular vote.  If two candidates receive the same number of electoral votes and tie in an election, the House of Representatives then chooses the president, while the Senate choose the vice president, but their votes may not show who voters want as president, seeing that voters often vote one party for president while the other for their representatives (Plumer 12). The vote for president is distributed unevenly, and states with many voters will only be represented by one vote. this could lead to the House of Representatives choosing a president that is only liked by a small population and this cannot easily be undone. Swing states are the only thing that can cause or prevent a tie in elections, and a tie has almost occured in 1976 in Hawaii and in 1968 in Ohio.  For example, many people believe their vote goes to waste. As stated in the article by Richard Posner, \"Democrats in Texas, for example, or Republicans in California. Knowing their vote will have no effect, they have less incentive to pay attention to the campaign they would have if the president were picked by popular vote.\" Voters want to feel involved and have interest in the political system. People also fear the tie in an electoral vote. They feel like the government will choose whoever will benefit them the best and they won't take the people into consideration. In article, \"The Indensible Electoral College: Why even the best laid defenses of the system are wrong\", the author says the electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. He believes it's anachronism.  each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee, and that trust is rarely betrayed\" (Source 3, Paragraph 2). So when the party selects their electors they are most likely to select the candidate of the party they were selected by. There is also regional appeal,if a president only has diserably mojority of vores in a certain region of the country he is \"unlikely to be a succesful president\"( Source 3, Paragraph 5) . This is because if a president is only desired by a certain region and not the rest of the country, the wants of the rest of the country aren't met and he most likely will not tend to the needs of them, and ultimately doesn't have a chance of being selected as president. Finally, when no candidate for president has a clear majority of votes, the electoral college's votes gove a clear winner and a candidate is selected.  For instance, there technically is no region of the country that has enough electoral votes to vote a president into office, so no one area of the controls large numbers of votes. Along with this, the system helps avoid Run-Off Elections (which complicate the election process and provide a clear winner).  The people make the decisions, the people vote for what they want and the people should be able to elect a president they believe will give them that! According to source 3 \"... it is the electors who elect the president, not the people.\" Why can't the people be the electors? If the people in the United States don't have the freedom to vote for a president of their choice, what say do they really have? Electing a president is like raising money for charity, the president does all the work but all they money that is raised goes to charity (the people). The people want someone who will help raise the money for them, not screw over their charity. Just like when signing up for a job the boss needs to see your resume, is like the people needing to see what the president can do to help their country. The citizens should be the ones making the decisions with help from the president that they believe could help with such decisions, not from electors who believe so.  Certainty of outcome means that one of the Presidential Candidates has to be cosen to become President. There are no recounts in Electoral College, whoever they like the most becomes President, and that ins't fair to the people. Bigger states tend to have more members in the electoral college. This can greatly influence an election if a big state like Texas favors one candidate over the other. Swing states are the states that recieve more atention than other states due to bias, greatly influencing votes. In my opinion, this is something that needs to be changed.  ",

                "content": "NASA. The United States form of a dominating space academy. The Viking 1, was in fact NASA's spacecraft that was launched in 2001. The spacecraft was set course for the small, red planet that is simillar to Earth. The planet is called Mars. Viking 1's \"sister\" Viking 2 was supposed to be landing on Mars, and that's why Viking 1 was sent up in space to begin with. While Viking 1 was snapping photos, its camera picked up a weird face-like structure on the surface of Mars. Some believe its a mysterious face that \"so called aliens\" built. I believe that their reasoning is just a bunch of garbage.  In 1976, the Viking 1 spacecraft was orbiting the planet of Mars, and it was taking new pictures for all of mankind to see. As it was passing over a strip of Mars called Cydonia, it snapped a picture that would cause an uproar in space exploration. This new picture showed what seemed to be a human face. A few days later NASA reveled these pictures for the world to see; it was an instant hit  NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft has found something while circling  Mars. But what is it, they have seem to have found a face formed into the rocks. Is this new discovery actually a face or is it just another rock formation.  The believers and the non-believers of the face on Mars are waiting anxiously to find out what it is. Is it a rock formation or is it an actual human face, no one knows  In 1976, Viking 1 took photos of Mars and found a huge rock formation that remebled a human head with shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth.  This was soon to be known as the \"Face on Mars\".   In 1988 a Viking 1 took a, slightly disturbing, picture. Of a face! Viking 1 found a landform that happends to look like an Egyptian Pharoah. This face was found and started major controversy.  Some people had thought that it was fake and others thought that it was just a coincidence. The massive sand storms just created a face. That's all that they thought. But can that be true?   n paragraph 10 it says,\" ...43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo.\" This shows that the photo didn't give very compelling evidence that there was life on Mars. soon later NASA and their supporters claimed that this face is just an act of nature is because of the 1998 Global Surveyor spacecraft. This new spaceship passed over the red planet to take pictures of the \"face on Mars\". The pictures were ten times better than the last pictures of Cydonia this time. The new photos clearly showed a landform on Mars and not a man.  \"And so on April 5, 1998, when Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) team snapped a puicture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos.\"  The Apollo 11 mission was just seven years old! To attach a high-powered camera to a space shuttle was very challenging at the time. I still hold to my belief that, during the 1976 mission, it was either the fault of the Viking I for holding a bad angle for the camera and causing blurriness, or the camera's fault for simply not being powerful enough. The 1976 photo spans just 43 meters per pixel, which at the time was a very high resolution, but now is considered very low. All in all, the Viking I photo of the Face on Mars is forty years old and must not be taken as seriously as it once was.  Like we said during this speech we said that \"And so on April 5, 1998, when Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing... a natural landform.\" Later on we did it again in the speech \"Nevertheless, on April 8, 2001- a cloudless summer day in Cydonia- Mars Global Surveyor drew close enough for a second look. \"We had to roll the spacecraft 25 degrees to center the Face in the field of view,\" Said Garving. \"Malin's team captured an extraordinary photo using the camera's absolute maximum resolution.\" \"Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo.\" Now you may say that we never did that, but we have photographic evidence of that clear photo that lets you see everything on the face. So we have the evidence we need to prove that this photo is real.  To start, NASA has taken recent picture of Cydonia in 2001 that shows it is just a natural landform that has developed on the Red Planet Mars. \"On April 8. 2001--a cloudless summer day in Cydonia--Mars Global Surveyor drew close enough for a second look. \"We had to roll the spacecraft 25 degreesto center the Face in the field of view,\" said Garvin. \"Malin's team captured an extraordinary photo using the camera's absolute maximum resolution.\" Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel inv the best 1976 Viking photo.\" (p. 10).

The electors can be picked in many different ways. Sometimes they are they are picked at state conventions, they can be picked at state party's central committe, or sometimes the presidental canidate picks them themselves according to Bradford Plumer (source 2).  A lot of voters who are not very well educated may not even understand what the electoral college is or what they are actually voting for when they vote. Instead of voting for the candidate that they want as the next president, they are voting for a group of electors that decide who will win. Sometimes, the electors that are assigned to that candiadate will not vote for them. This process also seems to disriciminate against the less populated states because they don't have as much a say in the college and are often forgoten in the rush of propaganda and aren't really aware of who they should pick and why they should pick them.  As you probably already know, each state's \"...entitled allotment of electors equals the number of memebers in its Congressional delegation...\" (Source One, paragraph 3). Most represntatives spend most of their time campaining in places like New York and California that the small states such as Rhode Island arent even visited. \"In the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see candidates at all...\" and that campaign was refered to as a \"fiasco\" in which the Electoral College caused a dispute (Selection 2, paragraph 13).\u00a0  Most states have a \"winner-takes-all\" system (with the exception ofMaine and Nebraska) that awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate in their state.(source 1) There may be an arguement that no state has enough votes to give the presidency to someone; however, this system basically casts away the other votes of those on the side of the opposing candidate, making it undemocratic. Besides that, there is also the chance that a few of the electors go rouge and vote for the opposing candidate.  Men who are running for a spot as a presidental candidate are not voted for by the citizens of that state. They have to gain supporters who then become the electors. Then the people of that state have to vote for the electors, not the person to become a presidental candidate. Voters can't even directly vote for who they want. What if you vote for a slate of electors, who are supposed to be in favor of the presidnetal candidate you want, but don't vote for him? What happens then? Presidental candidates who should actually get a chance at running for president because they didn't get enough electoral votes.  It seems unfair that the president of the United States, the most important man in the country, is not truely picked by the voters, but by the Elctoral College. The Office of the Federal Register says that the electors that are selected are chosen by the candidates political party but that stae laws differ on how they are specifically selected. This way does not seem like the best way of performing the task and I can see how it results in issues. Trusting the weight of the United Stated on the the backs iof only 538 electors is not the most stable way to perform an election. Why trust a select group with this descion if the whole United States can contribute to it  In 1960, a group of segretationists in the Louisiana legislature almost succeeded in removing electors who supported John F. Kennedy with those who opposed him. If this had happened, all of the states electoral votes would have been cast by biased electors, rather than by the actual voters themselves. In the same year, Hawaii sent two state electors to congress instead of one. It is sad that we maintain a system in our government that continues to let issues like this arise. Along with issues with the electors, why is it that the size of a state automatically gives it a bigger advantage in elections? Texas and California are the most two saught-after swing states in every election. Candidates will do everything they can to win over those electoral votes. But what about the little states? Many of the smaller states do not get visited by candidates. Some never even see campaign ads. This system we are using creates target areas in the United States that are more valuable in elections than others. This is in no way fair to the voters in smaller states, despite having the exact same rights as voters of bigger states. ",

                "content": "Well, first of all, The atmospere of Venus has a THICK layer of carbon dioxide the covers 98% of the planet, in which makes Everything a much hoter place,but, to top it of with the atmosphere problem, the clouds in there have highly corrosive sulfuric acid. If we some how passes through the atmosphere, than we'll face ANOTHER problem with the ground. Since Venus is the second planet from our sun and with all those carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, the surface ground temperature is over 800 DEGREES FAHRENHEIT. In which with the surface and the atmosphere, it could basically melt many types of metal with no problem. Another Problem is that the atmosphereic preassure is 90x greater than our Earth, with that much preassure could easily crushed a submarine that is built to surrvive the deeper end of the ocean. From what we gather small information from our space craft, the geology of venus pretty much have erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lighting strikes.  The article mentions that \"A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent blankets Venus.\" As carbon dioxide is waste product of human respiration, the inhalation of this gas would be very dangerous for life to visit Venus. It also says that \"On the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Farenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet.\" Without shelter that can withold these extreme temperatures and amounts of pressure, the human body, similar to the spacecrafts, would be lucky to survive for more than a few hours. These numbers support the author's claim to focus on the horrific dangerous of exploring Venus to present a logical standpoint on this issue.  \"A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus. Even more challenging are the coulds of higly corrosive sufuric acid in Venus's atmosphere.\" In Paragraph 3, the author does not give a higly convincing argument. Humans need oxygen to live, so how is it expected for them to survive on a planet that has little to no oxygen? It is not possible to change the chemical makeup of an entire planet. The argument displayed by the author is not credible in any way and does not give any reason as to why one would want to continure research in this area.  Venus is a challenge to get to with its hot surface, with its thick atmosphere, and atmospheric pressure. But scientists and astronomers are facinated by Venus, because they believe it had oceans and could have supported various forms of life.  Venus having an average of 800 degrees fahrenheit on its surface, make's it virtually inhabitable to humans. These conditons are so extreme the author explains that \"such an environment would crush even a submarine accustomed too diving to the deepest parts of our oceans.\" Venus has very harsh conditions and it make's it virtually impossible to explore it from the surface and proposes a tough challenge on finding alternatives ways to explore it. Although, NASA has proposed an idea to explore the harsh planet. NASA believes we can explore the planet from a distance approximately 30 miles away. The author explains that the pressure would be comparable to sea level on earth, tempature would be around 170 degrees. The author states that \"Not easy conditions but survivable for humans.\" The mission would propose great danger and it would be a expontential battle, but with the right people and technology it could be done and accomplished. The benefit is the knowledge gained from this great planet that has had the world beat for a long time, it is time to step up to the challenge and explore Venus for the people of this world.  According to the article, 97 percent of the atmosphere of Venus is carbon dioxide, which is unable to be breathed by humans. Another detail the article states is that on the surface of the planet, the average temperatures is over eight hundred degrees. The climate and enviorment of Venus is too dangerous for exploration. The planet does not hold nowhere near a safe enviorment for people or even machine.  In this article the evidence they use for example: \"These conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth; such an environment would crush even a submarine accustomed to diving to the deepest parts of our oceans and would liquefy many metals\" and also \"A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus\" supports the controdicting claim that going to Venus is too dangerous with too many complications.  In \"The Challenge of Exploring Venus,\" the author describes why putting a man on the moon seems like a walk in the park compared to the horrendous obstacles preventing humans from pushing the frontier with visiting one of Earth's neighbors, Venus. The thick atmosphere is toxic to us. The clouds of sulfuric acid, the incredibly high temperatures on the planet's surface, and pressure would present challenges to mankind and its technology.  Venus has features such as mountains, craters, and even valleys that are also seen on Earth. According to the article, its atmosphere is 97% carbon dioxide with temperatures averging 800 degrees Fahrenheit. Atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than Earth with can crush nearly anything that tries to reach its surface and even liquefy metals. The second paragraph discussed how spacecrafts in the past barely lasted a few hours and since there hasn't been a spacecraft sent there in more than three decades. This evidence shows that despite the success of reaching Venus, we are not even close to even slowly progressing and fixing smaller issues with spacecrafts traveling there and back to Earth.  Venus is the second planet in the Milky Way solar system, that is so close yet so mysterious. Its conditions are unhabitable and unsafe for humans, making Earth seem safe despite some dangers it also has. Venus may well have also been covered with oceans like Earth currently has. ",

When adjusted for population growth, the number of miles driven in the United States peaked in 2005 and dropped steadily thereafter, according to an analysis done by Doug Short of Advisor Perspectives, an investment reseach comapny.\" In this article, the disregard full time use of vehichles is also shown. \"The Internet makes telecommunicating possible and allows people to feel more connected without driving to meet friends. The renewal of center cities has made the suburbs less appealing and has drawn epty nesters back in. Likewise the rise in cellphones and car-pooling apps has facilitated more flexible commuting arrangements, including the evolution of shared van services for getting to work. With all these changes, people who stopped car commuting as a result of the recession may find less reason to resume the habit.\" People today can get access to a vehicle on command. Different resources make the constant use of cars unneccesary.  In \"Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota\" by Andrew Selsky, improvments to Bogota, Colombia as a result of less car usage is expaned upon. \"The day without cars is part of an improvement campaign that began in Bogota in the mid-1990s. It has seen the construction of 118 miles of bicycle paths, the most of any Latin American city, according to Mockus, the city's mayor. Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city; uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks; rush-hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic; and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have been cropped up.\" Cities are beggining to cater to the needs of those who don't\u00a0 use cars. Their negative impact on city streets is finally being recognized, and many are taking action to improve aspects where they live other than roads. In \"The End of Car Culture\" by Elisabeth Rosenthal, the author discusses the goals of the United States and its major figures to reduce total reliance on cars. In this article Bill Ford, executive chairman of Ford Motor Company shares his hopes. \"He proposed partnering with the telecommunications industry to create cities in which \"pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commerical and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected netowork to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and improve safety.\" Many are striving to make public spaces more accessable to those who choose more concious methods of transport.  Public transportation is getting on board with this idea and trying to accomodate those who have made this decision by making public transit \"free of charge from Friday to Monday,\" according to the BBC in the article  Paris bans driving due to smog . As also mentioned the importance of car is no longer such an immediate thought to people more recently.\u00a0 Elisabeth Rosenthal solidifies this in the article  The End of Car Culture when she includes \"recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by.\" This clear and simple states that people are not considering their cars as such an extreme item and more considering it as a means of transportation only when absolutely necessary such as when \"Bay Area Rapid Transit doesn't work.\" As well costs not only personally so much as federally are being affected dramatically. Elisabeth Rosenthal author of In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars explains \"In previous bills, 80 percent of appropriations have by law gone to highways and only 20 percent to other transport.\" By intorducing this idea, people are aware that the advantage is personal and is in the everyday common person's favor.   \"Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe...and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States\", Rosenthal writes in \"In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars\". By driving less, we can reduce our greenhouse gas emissions. \"Paris bans driving due to smog,\" by Robert Duffer, is a prime example of the reduction of air pollution after limiting car usage. \"After days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city\", writes Duffer. One Friday, the smog of Paris \"rivaled Beijing, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world\". On the following Monday, motorists with even-numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a $31 fine. After only one day with less cars on the roads, the smog had nearly dissappeared. This shows that even a day with less cars can make a huge difference in the amount of air pollution. Rosenthal's article, \" The End of Car Culture\", states that many sociologists believe that if the pattern of less cars continues, \"it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment\" because transortation is America's second largest sourse of carbon emissions. Less air polution is a very important advantage of less cars.   Cars have always been apart of American culture. From the \"...birth place of the Model T;\u00a0the home of Detroit; the place where Wilson Pickett immortalized \"'Mustang Sally'\"(The End of Car Culture, Rosenthal) Cars and automobils have impacted our everyday lifes from going to the store to hanging out with friends, but car usage has been stedily decreesing and for all the right reasons.  \"After days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city.\" (Duffer 10). This states that the air has been getting so polluted that some cities have been temporarily banning the use of cars because of this issue. Earth has been getting too polluted and destroyed lately, to the point that some people have been trying to predict an \"end is nigh\" date due to all of these issues with earth. Scientists have been talking about global warming for years now, and the problems we have been having with the greenhouse effect and the ozone layer. \"President Obama's ambitious goals to curb the United States' greenhouse gas emissions, unveiled last week, will get a fortuitous assist from an incipient shift in American behavior: recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by.\" (Elisabeth Rosenthal 29). So it seems that the lower use of cars by Americans has been helping the atmosphere and postponing the date of the complete destruction of the ozone layer. That was why cars have such a big impact on the environment as a whole.  Elisabeth Rosenthal states that car usage reduction \"will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment\" (Source 4), especially in America \"since transportation is the second larget source [of emissions]\" (Source 4). Cutting down on cars for alternative, public, or group transportation provides a solution to the car epidemic of suburban America.  In the article \"Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota\" by Andrew Selsky, the changes that the Columbian city of Bogota has gone through in response to less car use are discussed. The changes are a direct result of the city's Day Without Cars campaign, where car use is banned for the whole city for one day out of a year. It reads, \"It has seen the construction of 118 mile of bicycle paths, the most of any Latin American city, according to Mockus, the city's mayor. Parks and sports centers have also bloomed throughout the city;uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks; rush-hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic; and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up\".\u00a0 These additions are in response to the city's inhabitants using alternative transport. Since cars could not be used, the public had to get to where they were heading by other means. Bogota was able to use the situation to improve itself by either fixing things already in place or adding new ones competely. Another way that a city improved itself as a result of limited car use is shown by Elisabeth Rosenthal in her essay \"In German Suburn Life Goes On Without Cars\". She writes, \"While there have been efforts in the past two decades to make cities denser, and better for walking, planners are now taking the concept to the suburbs\". One of the results of applying this idea to suburbs is that stores are placed within walking distance of houses rather than in a mall next to a highway. Vauban, the city where the changes took place, is taking advantage of the opportunities to open new stores. This change would not only create more business for the strore itself but improve the economy of the city by increasing spending. The overall impact that limiting car use has had on citites is that it provides opportunity for the city to improve itself.   With global warming increasing by the day, any step to reduce pollution and greenhouse gases should be taken, limiting car usage is an essential tool to head in that direction. As a Elisabeth Rosenthal from the New York Times expounded: \"Passanger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States.\" Clearly cars are extremely harmful to the environment. However there is hope, because once car usage is limited these high numbers can be mitigated everywhere. In fact, in Paris, as Robert Duffer from the Chicago Tribune reported, policies to lower car usage have been taken and have actually worked! In France's capital \"motorists with even-numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22-euro fine. The same would apply to odd-numbered plates the following day.\" In hopes to reduce carbon emmissions and save the environment, Paris's prayers were answered as the smog cleared enough for the government to remove the ban for odd-numbered plates. Clearly, the pollution reduced due to one factor--limiting car usage. If actions around the world are initiated similar to Paris's plan, then a better environmental future is inevitable. The environmental benefits of reducing car usage are endless. After all we only have one planet, cars should not be the machines to dictate our environmental future.  people all over the world are paying attention to what they can do to help the environment, meaning that this is an advantage that will appeal to a widespread audience. One way that limiting car usage will help is that it will reduce greenhouse gas emissions. In Elisabeth Rosenthal's essay \"In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars\", she writes, \"Passenger cars are responsible for 2 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe ... and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States\". By limiting the usage of cars, the amount of greenhouse gases being emitted into the world would decrease substantially. While the idea that everyone would stop using their cars and the gas emissions caused by them would disappear completely is unrealistic, the prospect that a majority of the emissions could do so is perfectly reasonable. The reduction of these emissions would mean that the air quality would increase and be overall healthier for both all the world's population and all the wildlife across the world. Robert Duffer provides another example of how less car usage would impact the environment in his essay, \"Paris bans driving due to smog\". According to the article, an intense smog had covered Paris for five days, when the city decided to ban car usage over the course of two days. The cause for the smog was thought to be the high use of diesel fuel in France, with 67 percent of cars using it over gasoline, about 14 percent higher than the rest of Western Europe. The plan for the ban had been that cars with even-numbered license plates to not be used the first day and for ones with odd-numbered license plates not to be used the next day. In actuality, cars with odd-numbered plates were never banned from driving since the smog had cleared just after the first day. This shows the impact of limiting car usage. In just one day, a smog that was comarable to the one in Beijing, China, one of the most polluted cities in the world, was removed considerably after just half the normal amount of cars were used over the course of a day. If this was used all over the world, the result would be even more significant. This evidence supports that limiting car use is good for the environment in more ways than one. ",

Most teachers have to stop the lesson because they have to waste their time taking students cell phones away.  One might believe that when students aren't in a classroom environment, they are simply just going to find a way to cheat the system and not actually do the work and tests assigned to them like a famous Youtube creator has told his fans  This effect is not a problem at home, because one does not have to fear getting talked about by fellow students in the classroom. In the isolation of one's home, nobody sees them, what they have on, how their hair looks, etc. For example, one could have half of their hair undone, and not have to worry about what the next person has to say about it. This online replacement, in fact, completely eliminates the need to get ready and look the utmost best to try to avoid stares and whispers.  If a student is feeling sad or feeling stressed about home problems which they are trying to conceal, then the technology detects this and displays it for the teacher and the electronic lesson to see. This is an invasion of privacy, as the teacher does not need to know about a student's homelife or about their feelings outside the classroom. A teachers job should be to monitor how their students are feeling about their lessons, not about how their students are feeling about their life outside of school, and since this technology could pick up on digressing feelings, it should not be used in a classroom where a student's internal feelings are revealed to a teacher. Therefore, using Facial Action Coding could end up being an invasion of privacy that should not be introduced to the classroom.  Around middle and high school, classes aren't the only thing become harder, there is also pressure regarding students and their peers. Many teenage students may have a difficult time focusing in a classroom due to another students presence there which throws the student off. It could be whether it is a romantic interest, a bully, or someone who does not treat them well and makes them feel uncomfortable when they are in their presence. Or it could be that the student isn't comfortable around new people or doesn't like to be in a crowded place and prefer to be alone or in an environment in which they are used too. Regardless, it affects the student and negatively impacts their studies. If the student could attend a class through online means, or have a video conference with the teacher when they are teaching, they could still learn the material they need to know while at the same time staying in an environment where the student is comfortable in and not having to deal with peers who make the student feel uncomfortable.  If a person is having troubles in all of his classes a teacher cant only pay attention to him she has to look after the rest of the class. if they are at the back the teacher might not get to him because of all the people at the front. This way the student learns the minimum amount of knowledge he needs to pass the test or the quiz.  ",

                "content": "Some people don't even bother voting due to the fact that their vote will not contribute to their favored candidate's election. This happens often when a democratic voter lives in a republican state, and vice versa (source 3)  In Source 2 Plumer declares, \"faithless electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party's canidate\". With this method of selection for our country's president, the vote is never certain. The slate of electors that the people essentially vote for may or may not stick to the original plan. This ties back into people losing hope that their vote will not matter because they trust the electors to vote their canidate into office, when the electors could go either way. Another key point is, the canidates may not campaign in states that have a lower number of electoral votes. In Source 1 the Office of the Federal Register also asserted, \"Most states have a 'winner-take-all' system that awards all electors to the winning presidential canidate\". Due to the Electoral College system being based off population some states have more of a say than others. Whenever a state decides their votes for Electoral Colleges the state typically contributes every vote it has to one canidate. When this occurs the state's people may be misrepresented.  \"Because of the winner-takes-all system in each state, canidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight race in the \"swing\" states.\" What the author is saying here is the canidates dont give equal chances to the states to here what they,the canidates, have to say. For example if a democrate is going to states he would most likley avoid the ones full of republicans because he feels he has no chance and does not spend the money. But, if we get majority votes this will allow every indvividual to vote rather a group of republicans. Not only does this allow a better chance of winning for that democrate it allows the voters to feel like they can change there minds because they have a say. This will contribute to the conidates because they can now get there point across to more, rather then to select little groups.  Some may say that the winner-take-all system isn't fair to some states because most of the candidates don't even bother going to the states that they know they have no chance in winning.  In source three, Posner states \"it is the electors who elect the president, not the people.\"If one has gone through an election, theres a long process and hassle of being able to vote, but if people go through the craziness to vote, why not make the vote count?\"\"Faithless\" electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please.\"(Plumer, paragraph 11). Not only are voters wasting their time to vote but the electors cheat. For example, if one candidate has the urge to win, they will send one of their electors to be on the opponents side so the opponent loses a vote that they believed would be theres. Electoral College also may not be fair to those in a small state. \"a large state gets more attention from presidential canidates in a campaign than a small state does...\", as said by Posner. Its not fair that even the people who vote from a small state, won't really get recognized because there are bigger states to overrule, and even then, the electors will still choose who they desire. Electoral College is an unfair, and a cheating way to vote.  For example, many people believe their vote goes to waste. As stated in the article by Richard Posner, \"Democrats in Texas, for example, or Republicans in California. Knowing their vote will have no effect, they have less incentive to pay attention to the campaign they would have if the president were picked by popular vote.\" Voters want to feel involved and have interest in the political system. People also fear the tie in an electoral vote. They feel like the government will choose whoever will benefit them the best and they won't take the people into consideration. In article, \"The Indensible Electoral College: Why even the best laid defenses of the system are wrong\", the author says the electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. He believes it's anachronism.  but in the past the electors have refused to vote for their party's candidate. You do not want to put this in hands of someone who will not help you and the other people on such an important event like voting.  Everyone would get to put in their opinion on who should be the president of the United States. I think that if everyone was to be able to individually vote for their president, there would be less chaos and arguements about the election and also the new president.\u00a0But,\u00a0it is possible that the winner of the electoral vote won't win the national popular vote. But, it is very rare. Some people don't bother voting because of the fact that their vote will have no effect. They have less incentive to pay attention to the campaign than they would have if the president were picked by popular vote.  \u00a0 In the article,\"Does the Electoral College Work\", it states that becasue of the diffrent sizes of our states some people feel they do not get a fair say in who makes decisions for our country. They feel that because they dont live in a big state like Texas they do not have equal say in the decisions our country makes. In the article Plumer wrote, \" In the same vein, faithless electors have pccasionally refused to vote for their party's canidate and cast a deciding vote for whoever they please...\". The Electoral College is changing peoples mind set on how to vote because they feel why should we care if the government does not, can you blame them? If we just took out the simple problem of the Electoral College more voters will vote honestly rather then go with everyone elses vote.  because candidates don't spent time in the states they know they will lose in. They only foucus on the states that they know they will win in or of a close chance to the other candidate, because of this there has been times when people would not see the candidates at all or they did'nt get to see a single campaign ad. If there was popular vote then this would not be the case and it would be eliminated, because candidates would have no choice but to put up advertisments all over the country. ",

                "content": "and I agree, students usually at middle school\u00a0should try and sign up for something that will benefit for them like, sports and maybe some extra lessons to keep up their grade up, or try out and be ahead of everyone else, now while that may seem bad its really not, because it's there choice if they want to take geometry one year and take algebra 2 in the summer, or after school everyday. They'll be on their way to getting a good job or even be being the next Albert Einstein, who knows?  At every school, there is always a group of individuals that have no interest in being at school, and focus all of their efforts into disrupting the class. At home, you can not only rid yourself of these students who curse loudly, blast music throughout the halls and classrooms, and often start fights in the middle of class, but also other distractions such as the droning artificial lights and loud air conditioning. Schools have small budgets for large amounts of students and this causes the school to make financial choices that sacrifice quality school equipment, such as quieter air-conditioning and plumbing that doesnt shake the walls of surrounding classrooms every time someone needs to relieve themselves.  As a current student in middle school, I have learned how children use cell phones. If you are reconsidering the cell phone policy, I believe the second one is the only way to go. Children in this school may sneak their cell phones into class without the teacher ever knowing if they are not banned. This will also lead to students doing poorly in class because they won't be paying attention to the teacher. Also, the use of cell phones in a wrong way can cause a student to get hurt. Overall, I believe your second policy to ban cell phones in class is the best choice because after being a student in school, I know what will happen if they are allowed in school.  Often, when teachers ask if everyone understands the material, students who do not understand, will be too emabrassed to ask for help, or the teachers, with such a large class, will not notice if one or only a few students are falling behind. Furthermore, in the article, Dr. Huang states that \"'most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication\" meaning that most communication is picked up in other ways, such as visually. Unfortunately, often in a classroom setting, teachers must face away from their students when writing on a white board at the front of the classroom, or in similar situations, which means that without the visual connection, much of the communication between students and teachers is lost. The new technolgoy could help with this problem, as it could identify students' emotions even when a teacher's back is turned, and thus could alert teachers and help them improve their lessons to fit their students' needs. It could also help evaluate emotions that teachers do not notice, such as if a student is confused, they may try to hide it. This new technology could identify these emotions and help the teacher make sure all of their students understand the material, which would lead to an improved quality of teaching and learning.  Students are forced to learn in classrooms with another 20-30 students. Some students have trouble concentrating with so many of their peers present. There will be less people at a time in online classes, so they can learn better and acquire a better grasp on concepts, as there are less distracting factors. The primary benefit, however, is for students with social anxiety, those who feel intimidated by the presence of others, which is more common than one might think. Those who say social anxiety can be reduced by being around large quantities of people at a time do not understand the mechanisms of anxiety. Sometimes time is the best remedy; being forced to indulge in conversation with their peers will only be an obstacle to students with anxiety-related issues. This obstruction is eliminated in distance learning.  My footsteps seemed impossibly loud as I walked into the classroom, and it felt as if everyone was watching me. I glanced around, taking in the unfamiliar eyes staring me down.  I'm never going to fit in here.  One of the eyes turned away from me and began to speak. She formed strange sounds with her mouth in a language that wasn't familiar to me. I turned around and ran out of the room, feeling so alone, so deserted. Salty tears stained my cheeks.  A week ago, I had taken a 14 hour long flight from  Generic_City to Generic_City. It was my first time being somewhere else other than my home country, and I felt so intimidated by the new environment. Strange shapes, strange sounds, and strange people with impossibly bright hair and piercing eyes surrounded me. It was all beautiful to me - but at the same time, the most horrifying thing I'd ever seen. I felt trapped in a haze. This haze was brimming with thoughts of never fitting in, never adapting to these alien surroundings, and mostly - the crushing feeling of homesickness.  This haze pushed me down into a deep cavern, and I was encapsulated by darkness. Even though my parents tried to find me in this cavern, every search effort was in vain, until something miraculous happened. An angel, perhaps, entered the deep labyrinth and ushered me out. Her name was Ms. Generic_Name. She gave me a new perspective, a new bias. Ms. Generic_Name told me to view this unfamiliar atmosphere as something special, a new opportunity - not a hostile monster trying to swallow me whole. She told me to be glad of the change in my life. This was the first time I had ever listened to somebody's opinion and savored it in my heart. I didn't know the importance of listening to the viewpoints of others at the time. I thought  I always knew what was best; after all, nobody knew me better than myself. I took her words and used them as fuel for learning English and making friends. I thought her words were all I needed, but somehow, I was still in despair. I still struggled. So - I decided to let someone else tell me what they thought was best.  After school, I talked with my parents. I told them what I felt, that I was always alone. That I felt so, so homesick. They told me it was good to feel that way. Moving overseas was a tough thing to endure, and they said it was healthy to let myself feel down sometimes. They told me I didn't always need to pretend I was happy when I was not. These two opinions from Ms. Generic_Name and my parents shaped me as a person - I learned to let people in, and know that seeking multiple opinions is a wise thing to do.\u00a0Because of this, I learned to speak English and surround myself with a group of compassionate, kind friends who guided me through my darkest times. I learned to let in my parents and take notice that they always wanted what was best for me. I learned that I didn't always know what was best, and that was okay.  Forcing students to participate in an extracurricular activity is unethical and promotes involuntary participation to students who are already busy managing grades and a social life. Highschoolers, and even middle-schoolers, are constantly under pressure to pursue high academic scores while putting aside time for socialization. This new rule is immoral and does not value student's time or schedule. The school should spread awareness about after school\u00a0activities so that teenagers can reach out on their own, rather than bluntly making them join an activity they don't have time for or interest for.  Throughout the school day, everyone has that one class they absolutely hate. They walk into the room and it's like a minute turns from 60 to 1,000 seconds and they are stuck there forever. In this time, nothing gets done and the same amount gets learned. This class consists of about half who actually care about what the subject is, and the other half who can't seem to control themselves enough to not act out in spite of not caring. The half of the students who actually pay attention are stuck with a teacher who has to repeat themselves\u00a0a thousand times a class period when they should be on another chapter by now. This not only frustrates the teacher and the students, but it creates negative air between the students and the teacher. I mean, who wouldn't hate a teacher that talks about the mitochondria a BILLION times a day? In this situation, some perks of distance learning are shown. The students who show passion to learn can be offered one-on-one time with the instructor through video conferencing, which will not only help the faster paced learners, but take away some of the tension in the classroom.  Similarly, while in my AP Chemistry class, since I am usually one of the last students to finish the test, there is always a constant moving of students and whispering among the inconsiderate students who cause me to lose focus. It is very challenging for students to concentrate on their thoughts when they are followed by constant whispering and movement going on in the classroom. These distraction may cause students to either get the question wrong or run out of time, therefore, hurting their education  Students are often young and their brains have the power to rapidly grasp and process information. However, this ability can be negatively affected especially when the student is in an environment that they are well acquainted with. A well known area where students have limited interactions can dull their curiosity and aspirations for learning, causing boredom. This boredom is able to take over a young student's malleable mind and replace curiosity with distraction. In a world where technology is ubiquitous and can bring the world to one's fingertips, students would much rather research the latest scores of a basketball game or catch up on celebrity gossip, than they would learn about the Pythagorean theorem. At home, a student's mind is able to roam around freely, especially without an instructor prohibiting such distractions. Making it less likely that students are being attentive to the subject being taught on an online forum that limits their participation in the class. Therefore, students will not benefit from attending online classes at home as they will get easily distracted by the comforts in their home. ",

The author also states, \"Some simplified electronics... have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface and have lasted for three weeks in such conditions\" (7). The author backs up her idea by using these electronics, that can survive three weeks on venus, to once again show that we can get through to venus. Science and technology being able to help us properly function on Venus shows that the planet is a worthy pursuit. Ultimately, the author backs up her idea by giving evidence on the different ways landing on Venus is possible.  Although the author describes how Venus could be studied from the air, scientists still desire to learn about Venus from the planet's surface. One of their solutions to the problem of getting equipment to last on the surface of Venus is to expirement with new materials. \"Simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the choas of Venus's surface and have lasted of three weeks in such conditions\" (7). Research and experimentation taking place on Earth is giving scientists and astronauts more options for studying Venus. Although conditions on Venus are not hospitable to life, these new scientific advances are making it possible for data-gathering equipment to be sent to the surface of Venus and last long enough to gather data. Other scientists are moving away from traditional electronics and looking into purely mechanical systems. \"Systems that use mechanical parts can be made more resistant to pressure, heat, and other forces\" (7). The alternative that has presented itself to would-be explorers of Venus is older technology, like that found in the earliest computers. Scientists have realized that modern technology is too fragile and that more durable technologies are needed. By turning to other forms of technology, scientists are widening their options for ways to study Venus. The author mentions three different ways that scientists are making progress towards being able to study Venus - from the air, using new materials, and using old technologies. The author's postion that Venus should continue to be studied is supported by the scientific advancements that are serving to make studying Venus a reality.  The Challenge of Exploring Venus\" is an article about the positives and negatives of trying to land a spacecraft on Venus. He has a decent build-up into his first point while giving more and more small facts about our second planet.  The author mentions that no spacecraft has survived on Venus: \"...no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours\" (The Challenge 2). Since these missions have been unmanned, there is not much loss except for the spacecraft itself, but if there had been a human aboard, the loss would be tremendous and nothing would be gained from the mission. The conditions of Venus simply will not allow manned missions for closer examination of the planet.  He mentions, \"...no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours. Maybe this issue explains why not a single spaceship has touched down on Venus in more than three decades.\" This quote uses ethos to ensure the reliablity of the author, and to emphasize that scientists are truly struggling to develop devices that are well enough developed to explains the dangers. The understanding that technology made by scientists who have succesfully researched across the milky way cannot withstand Venus's circumstanes demonstrates how dangerous the planet is.   The article says, \u00a8... humans have sent numerous spacecraft to land on this cloud-draped world,\u00a8 and then says \u00a8... since no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours.\u00a8 If a spacecraft made by people can not survive the landing on Venus numerous times, how can we even come close to surviving the trip? Venus is too dangerous to explore and it is a waste to even send a spacecraft. The spacecrafts cost a good amount of money to make and for them to be wasted on a inhospitable planet is not worth the information we would achieve.   but in reality, Earth and Venus are very differnet. Earth is much safer in terms of temperature, pressure, and gas compaired to Venus. Venus has a blanket of gas that covers it that is, \"almost 97 percent carbon dioxide.\" Plus, on its surface, \"temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit.\" with the level of carbon dioxide and the ragging heat that it has, nothing is safe for long on Venus, especially humans. He does state that several spacecrafts have attempted to land on Venus, and only lasted a few hours, but he doesnt state what happened to them. most people would guess that they just melted entirely because of the extreme heat, which is most likely what happened, but we don't know for sure.  NASA's advancements for Venus exploration are promising, \"For example, some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface and have lasted for three weeks in such chaos,\" (7). Humans would not be able to use the most advanced technology, but durability is the goal, \"By comparison, systems (mechanical computers that use gears and levers to calculate) that use mechanical parts can be made more resistant to pressure, heat, and other forces,\" (7). If humans were to only hover over Venus, the possibilites are limited. Humans and technology have to be as close as possible. Technology that could last for a few weeks is enough to vastly expand our knowledge. Mechanical computers are now obsolete, but in Venus would be a valuable tool, just like the other electonics being made. Researchers have worked tirelessly to continue making Venus exploration a reasonable reality.  In paragraph 7, it says, \"some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface and have lasted for three weeks in such conditions.\" This shows that they are already testing new methods that could possibly survive on Venus. In paragraph 7, it says, \"Another project is looking back to an old technology called mechanical computers...system that use mechanical parts can be made more resistant to pressure, heat, and other forces.\" This proves that they are using all resources that even date back to the 1800s.

As also mentioned the importance of car is no longer such an immediate thought to people more recently.\u00a0 Elisabeth Rosenthal solidifies this in the article  The End of Car Culture when she includes \"recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by.\" This clear and simple states that people are not considering their cars as such an extreme item and more considering it as a means of transportation only when absolutely necessary such as when \"Bay Area Rapid Transit doesn't work.\" As well costs not only personally so much as federally are being affected dramatically. Elisabeth Rosenthal author of In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars explains \"In previous bills, 80 percent of appropriations have by law gone to highways and only 20 percent to other transport.\" By intorducing this idea, people are aware that the advantage is personal and is in the everyday common person's favor.   Cars have always been apart of American culture. From the \"...birth place of the Model T;\u00a0the home of Detroit; the place where Wilson Pickett immortalized \"'Mustang Sally'\"(The End of Car Culture, Rosenthal) Cars and automobils have impacted our everyday lifes from going to the store to hanging out with friends, but car usage has been stedily decreesing and for all the right reasons.  In \"The End of Car Culutre\" by Elisabeth Rosenthal the decreasing numbers of people getting licenses and cars is discussed. \"But America's love affair with its vehicles seems to be cooling. When adjusted for population growth, the number of miles driven in the United States peaked in 2005 and dropped steadily thereafter, according to an analysis done by Doug Short of Advisor Perspectives, an investment reseach comapny.\" In this article, the disregard full time use of vehichles is also shown. \"The Internet makes telecommunicating possible and allows people to feel more connected without driving to meet friends. The renewal of center cities has made the suburbs less appealing and has drawn epty nesters back in. Likewise the rise in cellphones and car-pooling apps has facilitated more flexible commuting arrangements, including the evolution of shared van services for getting to work. With all these changes, people who stopped car commuting as a result of the recession may find less reason to resume the habit.\" People today can get access to a vehicle on command. Different resources make the constant use of cars unneccesary.  \"All of our development since World War II has been centered on the car, and that will have to change\" (Rosenthal source 1) said Transportation of America official David Goldberg in Elisabeth Rosenthal's article \"In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars.\" With air pollution, smog, and greenhouse gas emissions rising all around the world, officials have announced that cars are to blame. With this, many are resorting to making changes in their communities by offering alternate means of transportation and bringing homes and stores closer together.  few people will be buying gas or diesel fuel for their cars. Elisabeth Rosenthal tells her audience that Vauban, Germany has an upscale community where nearly everyone has given up their cars. Here, people sold their cars just so that they could buy a house in peace without having to hear traffic jams and honking horns all the time. Many say that this environment makes them happier because it is so peaceful. 70% of the community do nott own cars and the ones that do must leave it in a large parking garage outside the developement\u00a0 that is purchased with the home. In another article, also written by Elisabeth Rosenthal, discusses America and the recent\u00a0 decrease of the amount of driven by a single person. Research shows that the amount driven in 1995 is about the same as the amount driven in 2013. This is due to environmental protectionists who walk evrywhere they go and due to the dangers of driving. There are fewer young adults driving today as well; in eight years, the amount has decreased 23%  Elisabeth Rosenthal states that car usage reduction \"will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment\" (Source 4), especially in America \"since transportation is the second larget source [of emissions]\" (Source 4). Cutting down on cars for alternative, public, or group transportation provides a solution to the car epidemic of suburban America.  people all over the world are paying attention to what they can do to help the environment, meaning that this is an advantage that will appeal to a widespread audience. One way that limiting car usage will help is that it will reduce greenhouse gas emissions. In Elisabeth Rosenthal's essay \"In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars\", she writes, \"Passenger cars are responsible for 2 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe ... and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States\". By limiting the usage of cars, the amount of greenhouse gases being emitted into the world would decrease substantially. While the idea that everyone would stop using their cars and the gas emissions caused by them would disappear completely is unrealistic, the prospect that a majority of the emissions could do so is perfectly reasonable. The reduction of these emissions would mean that the air quality would increase and be overall healthier for both all the world's population and all the wildlife across the world. Robert Duffer provides another example of how less car usage would impact the environment in his essay, \"Paris bans driving due to smog\". According to the article, an intense smog had covered Paris for five days, when the city decided to ban car usage over the course of two days. The cause for the smog was thought to be the high use of diesel fuel in France, with 67 percent of cars using it over gasoline, about 14 percent higher than the rest of Western Europe. The plan for the ban had been that cars with even-numbered license plates to not be used the first day and for ones with odd-numbered license plates not to be used the next day. In actuality, cars with odd-numbered plates were never banned from driving since the smog had cleared just after the first day. This shows the impact of limiting car usage. In just one day, a smog that was comarable to the one in Beijing, China, one of the most polluted cities in the world, was removed considerably after just half the normal amount of cars were used over the course of a day. If this was used all over the world, the result would be even more significant. This evidence supports that limiting car use is good for the environment in more ways than one.  In \"In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars\", author Elisabeth Rosenthal shares the story of Vauban, Germany and their efforts to reduce greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. \"Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emmisions in Europe...and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States.\" The impact of these gas emmsions is incredibly negative on cities. They make the environment unstable and unsafe for a large number of people. These numbers could easily be reduced if fewer people chose to rely on cars as their mode of transportation. In some places the pollution caused by automobiles is so high that the government is stepping in to assist in the management of city spaces. In \"Paris bans driving due to smog\", author Robert Duffer explains this specific situation in Paris, France. \"After days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city. On Monday motorists with even-numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22-euro fine ($31). The same would apply to odd-numbered plates the following day.\" The effects of this temporary ban were also shared. \"Congestion was down 60% in the capital of France, after five-days of intesifying smog.\" It is easy to see that just a small reduction of vehicles created a significant change.  In the article \"In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars\", by Elisabeth Rosenthal, the author talks about a car-free town, Vauban, Germany.\u00a0Because there are not cars, people are forced to use other forms of transportation. Instead of using cars, mothers and their children walk everywhere, people ride their bikes to the store, and a tram is used to go to downtown Freiburg. Another place where transportation has benefited from a car-free society, is Bogota, Columbia. According to the article \"Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota\", written by Andrew Selsky, since car-free day began, bicycle and pedestrian-friendly areas have been improved. For example, since the 1990s, 118 miles of bicycle paths have been built in Bogota. \"Parks and sports centers have bloomed throughout the city; uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks; rush-hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic; and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up\", writes Selsky. Promotion of other transportation, such as walking, is just one of many benefits of limiting car usage.  \"Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe...and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States\", Rosenthal writes in \"In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars\". By driving less, we can reduce our greenhouse gas emissions. \"Paris bans driving due to smog,\" by Robert Duffer, is a prime example of the reduction of air pollution after limiting car usage. \"After days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city\", writes Duffer. One Friday, the smog of Paris \"rivaled Beijing, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world\". On the following Monday, motorists with even-numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a $31 fine. After only one day with less cars on the roads, the smog had nearly dissappeared. This shows that even a day with less cars can make a huge difference in the amount of air pollution. Rosenthal's article, \" The End of Car Culture\", states that many sociologists believe that if the pattern of less cars continues, \"it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment\" because transortation is America's second largest sourse of carbon emissions. Less air polution is a very important advantage of less cars.  ",

In Richard A Posners In Defense of the Electoral Collage he states that the Electoral Collage is good because of the \" swing states\" wich he then says \" The voters in toss-up states are more likely to be the most thoughtful voters because they know they are going to decide the election\" in saying this he means that people who live in swing states will be more careful and more thought out on who they want to vote for.  Abolishment of the Electoral Collage would not give power to all states and, would highten potential for bias political leaders.   I get that they have to monitor the votes but arnt we already using electronic computers to vote... I think voting would go alot smoother if the votes went strait to the presidents through computers instead of having an elector who has a strong personal opinion against one political party who has a chance of twisting the votes around to strongly support the political party that he/she is opinionized towards. This why the Electoral Collage is dangerous. There have been cases of law breaking electors twisting the votes around. It is alot more safe to just let the citizens to just strait up vote.  It has this ability, because to be a tie both canidates have to have 269 votes which is highly unlikly. To have a President chossen majority has to vote one way (270). Now with a \"winner-takes-all\" system that his country, USA, has, there are only so many combinations of states' votes for one party that there would be a tie. Since the beggening of the Electoral College there has only been two ties. The Electoral College does make it easier for there not to be a tie, because more people voting into selected individuals then having them vote makes it easier for less mess ups and faster counting of votes.  in our day and time we have smart phones and aindroids that we can use to vote for the president in the peoples choice. there could be a web site that you can go on to submit your election and at the end of the election the compuster can tally us the number of votes to the exact amount so it would be the peoples choice. its\u00a0 also outdated becouse we dont need one or a few guys to be sent somewhere to cast the vote of the people , we have so mmusch advanced technology that we can have any legal person who wants to vote can and actually have there vote matter insted of what the elector pick so it matters to those few poeple instead of every single person in america.  In conclusion,\u00a0 the state senators should eliminate the electoral collge because they count the majorty votes, and don't count other votes that is not popular as the other candidates vote. also because they can decide vote on an canditate they want based on their opinions and beliefs. and lastly because of the winner takes it all system which is bascially taking the losing candidates electoral votes.     It is possible to have a tiwe because there is an even number (538) of electors, But for a tie to happen is very unlikly. (source 3). Having no tie will ensure that we have a Presidnet that a majority of the citizen and even non-citizens are happy with.  Accoriding to bradford plumer he qoutes that \" The single\u00a0 best argument against the electoral colloge is what we might call the disatser factor\" (source 2). Even though electors votes it can lead to more of an unoraginized distaster. it can mainly lead to a lot of confusion and miss counts. a lot of people do not like the fact of electors being one just like the presidnet of untied states.

                "content": "Emotion is in the brain, not the heart. The way the FACS understands emoion is simple. It maps out a 3-D model of the face, looks at the shape and positoin of all the muscles, then it associates the different facial movements with differet emotion. For example, your orbicularis oris (muscles around your mouth) tighten your lips to show when you are angry. It even works when a person it trying to mask emotions. During a fake smile, the zygomatic major stretches the mouth sidways, while in a real smile the zygomatic major lifts the corners of the mouth. These examples can show how science IS able to understand emotoin, probaly better than most humans. Arguments that use that falshood, that science is unable to understand emotion, is completly false.  The article states that the technology associates each emotion with \"characteristic movements of the facial muscles\" and then uses those movements to calculate the spectrum of emotions based on their facial display. But some people show emotions in various ways, and the technology most likely cannot accomodate for the many different ways people express the same emotion. For example, if a student has a resting face that seems generally happy, the system might confuse this dazed face as a satisfied face and think that the student is happy with their lessons when they are actually confused or not paying attention. In the same way, if a student has a resting face that looks naturally sad, the system may think they are unhappy with their lessons, even if the student feels they are learning a lot. A lot of students also try to hide their emotions, like frusteration or sadness, with a happier look on their face, and even though the article states that the system can detect a \"false smile\", it cannot always be accurate as a person may be good at hiding their emotions and displaying a genuine smile. Therefore, since technology is not always accurate and because human beings are so various in the way they behave, the technology would not be useful in a classroom where it may misread a student's state of mind and lead them in the wrong path of education.  asking multiple people for their opinion helps you make a better choice to decied what best suits you, opens your eyes to different points of view, or possibilities. You now know the pros and cons for your question, you may even be able to relate to an opinion more, helping you decide on an option. In the end, you happily go home with a cat.\u00a0  Life contains many differences, includes positive and negative things, truthful or untruthful. Some people said emotions are never lie. We could figure out the statue of someone by looking at their face, and that's true. However, life is something really complicated, sometimes things in front of you don't mean like what you think. Likewise, even though the expression from people face is the most authenic, when they are trying to hide their feelings, we literally cannot know their real emotions. The changing of teenager is issue that causes headache for parents, their characters aren't the same like before, their emotions are changed. Both of them could not find the common speech, and push them further each other. That is the moment, the childrens easily fall in the darkness. For real instance, children or students aren't agree about their parent's thinking, or the education from school completely. Most of them don't say it out, or talk back. It's really affects about effective in studying and their plans in the future.  Without needing to have face- to- face human interactions to see how people are feeling, it could result in a decline of being able to recognize emotions in facial expressions.  I learned a few chords on the ukulele this summer. I could piece together a song or two. Now after a few months, I can't remember the first thing about playing those chords. This example shows that if you learn something then don't do it for an extended period of time, it will take a while to relearn how to do it. Although reading emotions is nothing like playing ukulele, the same holds true; if you learn something, and rely on something else to help you do it, it is going to be hard for you to re-learn how to do it again.  As stated in by Nick D'Alto, most human communication is not verbal. Meaning that people express their emotions by their looks or their actions, but they chose when to do this. The Facial Action Coding System takes away this freedom from students, they do not have the choice when to express what they are feeling if anyone can just use a face scanning system on them. \" Imagine being able to detect exaclty how other people are feeling, even when they are trying to hide their emotions (D'Alto 1),\" this first sentence perfectly shows how it takes away peoples freedom of when they want to express certian emotions tocertian people.  The age of computers is inescapable, but it doesn't have to be. Instead of computer analyzed emotional connection, people should put their phones down and ask each other how they are. Not every person wants their emotions analyzed, especially in schools. Students bonds with teachers are simply student to teacher; a child must trust an adult before they talk about their feelings. Computer facial technology might be helpful, but not in schools. This technology falls flat in the category of connection. Don't take the easy way out, instead of analyzing emotions with a computer, ask someone how they are. If a student looks upset, sit down and talk with them. Show someone they are valuable and deserve one on one human interaction  Every living thing on planet earth has emotions. These emotions have been used since the beginning of time to express the feelings of the people around you. However, these emotions can be decieving. Someone could say they are happy, when really they are angry or upset. This is where the Facial Action Coding System comes into play. The FACS is a software that detects human emotion by tracking muscles in the face. For example, when you are happy, muscles in your face move up, and when you are sad, they move down, FACS tracks this and calculates your emotions. The creators of this software, Prof. Thomas Huang and Prof. Nicu Sebe are the leading experts of developing better ways for humans and computers to communicate. There are still some questions surrounding the usefulness of FACS, like what could this software actually be used for? One of the ways FACS may be used is in classrooms.  The FACS will pick up emotions that a student is feeling and teachers, parents, and or consoulers will be able to get the help that that particular student aqquires. \"To an expert, faces don't lie; these muscle clues are sometimes used to spot when a \"smiling\" politicain or celebrity isn't being truthful.\" This same concept can work with students too. If a student is giving off a false emotion than that student really feels; the FACS can determine the actual emotion the student is feeling. If teachers and parents realize the actual feelings and emotions someone feels, he or she will be able to provide more comfort in the act of helping towards that individual.  New technology is being introduced to mankind almost every second in this world, and now, the latest techonology is a computer program called the Facial Action Coding System which can identify a person's emotions. The question is whether this technology is actually valuable and for what it could be used for. Experts suggest this technology could be used in a classroom to identify the state of mind of a student to adjust the lesson they are trying to comprehend. But, even though this technology may be helpful to teachers trying to keep students active and engrossed in their lessons, the question arises of whether this techonlogy is actually worth the recources or whether what experts think is a great idea is actually an invasion of privacy.

                "content": "Even today many struggle in making decisions of their own; if students are taught to make choose what they want to do, they'll have less difficulty in making good choices for themselves. Sometimes adults do not know what choices to make as some do not choose wisely. Letting students make their decisions through own accord can make it easier for them when they have to make important choices in their life as their brain will be programmed to think about the choice they are making. There are many skills people need to survive in the real world and decision making is one of them. Little things can have a big impact on many; it may not seem like a lot to let students design their projects but it can be a big influence on many.  Many students would say that they would never do such a thing, that they must honor their integrity, but they're lying. Teenagers are impulsive, and if there is an easy road out, we are going to take it, simple as that. For example, if a teacher gives an assignment and they say the answer key is on schoology to check our work, we're going to maybe attempt it. When we don't succeed, guess where we're going: Schoology. I'm saying that I don't trust teenagers to be able to honestly do every single assignment on their own especially if there are no eyes watching. Another example of this would be in a scenario of this said online school. Imagine that there's a big test due on the 18th in math that you haven't studied for. Today is the 17th. Everyone else has done the test and taken pictures of it in case their computers shut down, while others had malicious intent. You haven't studied at all. Your failure is imminent as you already have a C in the class and you need a C to graduate. Your heart is thumping, you don't want to seem a failure to your parents. So what do you do? Ask the teacher for an extension? No, he's too strict and he's going to say no. So you think your only option is to cheat. So you text a student who took picures for the wrong reason. You get the answers you so desperately wanted. But at what cost? You take the test and get a 70. You nearly failed, but you didn't. You find out a few days later that several students have asked for an extension and received one. That is the mindset a lot of students go through when they cheat on a test or assignment.  For example, studies have shown that when students are given work that's confusing or not\u00a0enjoyable; they procrastinate until the due date and the scores and grades are often lower. However, when students are given the opportunity to choose their own topics and work on what they want to do, they take more responsibility and complete the task on time with a higher score. Teachers being more experienced than students may be true, but giving students a chance and letting them work on their own may show better results. Often times, students are too focused on grades and rubrics, which can be stressful and upsetting when they receive a bad grade for their work they thought was good, however, when students follow their own rules and knowledge it'll be more rewarding when they receive a good grade and it'll be easier for students to find what they lack and need to work on, to improve when they receive a bad grade.   Student-designed projects may bring conflict to some who feel that they're doing more than another. This will only cause more stress on teachers and students who rather spend their time worrying about their own work. Students who may have had an older sibling in the same class tell them what to expect and then them receiving something completely different angers students. Students stick to the idea that everyone should get what others get, nothing different. If they receive something opposing their original belief, they will bring it to the teacher's attention almost immediately. The importance of teacher-designed projects is to inform the student not cause arguments. In addition, it will also limit the amount of work teachers have to put in. Teachers can then focus on what the main idea of the project is and assess each student based off of that.  In the eyes of a student currently attending Generic_School, like myself, working alone can sometimes be a struggle, two minds will always be greater than one. Two minds sometimes create bias, and at times bias is good. One would benefit from hearing the other side of the argument which may ultimately end one's single-sided thinking. Also having the classroom aspect where you have multiple people who look at the same thing in different ways is important as well. Maybe the way student A looks at something is more compliant to your way of thinking rather than student B. Classmates help each other\u00a0if the teacher can not, there are many instances in my learning here at Generic_School where I come to the terms of understanding a subject, but once one of my classmates broke it down for me in their way of thinking and seeing, a new light shown over the way I looked at things.  By doing so, teachers and students are most likely to get along with each other with no issues of any kind. Teachers are more than people who went to school and got their degree, but they are also regualr people just like everyone esle and at a certain point they become like family to us. So it is important for students to make sure they are in good terms with their teacher just in case they need help or guidance from the teachers, they will not get it if they behaved wrongly or cursed at their teachers which is something we often see in schools today. Well, if students and teacher manage to keep a steady and firm bond between one another, no obstacle or problem will come between their relationship, meaning they will be able to work with each other on a daily basis with no problematic concerns from either side.  There are some students that just don't like the idea of doing extra work when it's not required. It's not necessarily that they're lazy, but they just dont see the importance of going out of their way to do something that they can't see the immediate benefits to. Enforcing the change could arouse\u00a0some anger in a vast majority of students, and possibly parents, but if the students are given an option to not participate in an extracurricular activity, things would most likely run a lot smoother. Most people would call these types of kids, \"average\" due to the fact that they settle for the amount of work given, and typically don't want to exceed expectations. Perhaps making them participate in beneficial activities wouldn't hurt, they just need to be a little more open minded to the idea at hand.  When given a task you do not enjoy, most people do either of two things. The first thing they do is rush the task to get it over with, and the second thing they do is push it off as much as they can. Similarly, when a student is given an assignment that is not of interest to them, the quality of work is very low. In reference to the summer, this general idea is heightened; a majority of students tend to push off assignments to the very latest, creating lackluster work and also not learning much from the assignment. Personally, I have experienced this repeatedly. When I was given a summer assignment for my English class this year, I was eager to read the book. While, the book was interesting the assignment was extremely long. The intended goal of the assignment was to expand the knowledge and analysis of the book, but after completing the assignment, I felt like that once held excitement and knowledge was gone. If I had the ability to design my own assignment relating to the book, I most likely would have enjoyed completing the assignment, allowing for an expansion of knowledge. This does not only apply to my experiences with summer assignments, but also applies to my overall experience as a student. When given the liberty to decide my own work, I am not only excited to work, but I am also more dedicated. When my education is in my hands, I produce some of my best work. Currently as a junior enlisted in a self led research class, I have learned so much about myself and the overall topic I am researching. Although at first the task at hand was daunting, I learned how to organize myself effectively and complete a thorough research project that I am happy with. By having the research project on my own, I am constantly thinking about it and I spend more time to work. Giving students the ability to decide their course of work is one of the most beneficial decisions a teacher can make for the future of a student.  although I would respect the principal's ultimate decision, I disagree with her statement. Students should not have to be involved in an extracurricular activity. They should be able to choose if they want to participate in an activity. Ultimately, the students choice should be prioritized, because they know their own strengths, and there are a couple reasons to support my claim. The student may not have the money to do so, it may be out of their comfort zone, and lastly they may not have enough time, and forcing them to participate in an activity would bring stress onto their shoulders.   \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  At home, a student has limited resources and won't be able to receive support and feedback from teachers and classmates. If a student takes a class online, there won't be any teacher to tell him or her what and how to do the work. And so if a student is stuck on what they're supposed to do, or if they did something incorrectly, then they won't be have the chance for improvement or learn from their mistakes. Feedback is critical for a student's growth, and without a personal relationship with a teacher, there is no growth ",

Second, the electoral college has an even number of votes meaning there could be a tie therefore ruining the election. Finally, most people would like to personaly vote for theyre president rather than someone else to do it for you. These simple reason suggest why the senate should change the system.       \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  The last reason, why we should change over to election by popular vote is because of the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote.  To conclude this letter, I again say that the Electoral College should be changed to election by popular vote because, popular vote is fairer then the Electoral College, the people have no power compared to the electors and the are subject to corruption with in the system.  There are many reasons why the voting process should be changed to popular vote instead of the Electoral College.  In conclusion, I strongly feel that we need to change to an election by popular vote.\u00a0 Above all, it is more fair to the people.\u00a0 Citizens would feel that their votes matter more than they do now.\u00a0 People wouldn't have to be worried about if the electors would flip on what they had voted for.\u00a0 Although some say its is absolutely fair throughout all the states, there are still the set backs that come along with keeping an Electoral College.\u00a0 I agree with former presidents, Nixon and Carter, that we need to abolish the Electoral College.\u00a0 All of these reasons show you the problems there are with the current system of electing our President and I know you will agree  I think we should change the voting method we have now to popular vote because everyone would have a say in getting the right person to become our most important man.  The electorial collage should be changed to the popular voting method because it is unfair to the voters.  For many reasons, election methods must be changed to popular vote, and the Electoral College must be disgarded. It will only lead to a profound disaster, and it is also extremely biased and unfair. The United States must take action, one state at a time, to reverse the negative path it is on. This is the only way the U.S can finally reach its long term goal-- complete prosperity.     The first reason as to why I would be in favor of the popular vote process is that in the Electoral College process, big states are being more effective than small states.  In conclusion, we have established our opinion on why the vote should be changed into a popular vote instead of the Electoral College due to a myriad of concepts, such as the disaster factor in 2000, why swing-states are unfair, the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote, just to reveal the tip of the iceberg in our arguments of understanding why the Electoral College is biased, irrational, and unfair. We have also covered the counterclaims and reasoned them with logic, reality, and true rationality of why the Electoral College shoud be abolished in the vote of the President of the United States of America. So, ask yourself as a state senator, who is truly in the hands of the final say for the President? ",

                "content": "but the car may have a flaw. This again will bring conflict and debate. This can lead people to believe that driverless cars are unsafe and unproductive and is a liabilty. But say you were paying attention to your surroundings, instictively, you would look left and right. The car will go foward but, there is a car coming from the other side (remember there is no stop sign for the other car to stop at) you and that person collide. Again, the car is to have warned you but if you were alert, you would have taken control of the car when driving through a neighborhood.   I think that driverless cars are a terrible idea. There are too many problems that can occur during the driving process, and I don't want my life in the hands of a car that can't see or think the way that a human does  These examples of recklessness, misblaming and hacking all show why the idea of having driverless cars are not a good idea. They can mess up society and cause harm in more ways than it could help society. Although the car is a very unique way of showing advancement in the technological world, one would have tot look at both sides before concluding whether or not this is a good idea, and in this case it seems that the bad outweighs the good.  There are situations there a person is the best option. Unless the car can think for it self. The drivrless car is too unpredicatable and can put peoples lives in danger. Accidents occur all the time, i don't believe a driverless car can avoid an ongoing accident. Then there are situations with police, or stolen cars. Would the car give away its owner if they were on the run from the police? How would traffic stops work, would the car be so perfect to not break the law? The car could be harboring fugitives or runways or even kidnapped victims. The car wouldnt be smart enought to know, its going to do what its told and drive.  This could cause health risks to anyone who happens to be driving near a unmaned car. I agree with the states that do not allow the testing of the cars in their respected areas. While states such as California, Nevada, and Florida all allow the cars to be tested. These states are putting their people at risk just so they can find all the flaws of the car. Most people will agree when I say that is it really worth the risk of a human life just for a car that can drive itself but not really control itself.   To justify my argument that everyone should be against the development of these driverless cars, just think about if it was you. These cars can not be pradictable and no one can be postive what will really happen. But what if it was you who got hurt or maybe a family memeber, because they let these unsafe and unperdicable cars out onto the roads. You would have no one to blame because it was just a machine or just a accendent. They are never meant to hurt but everyone would rather be safe than sorry. Make the right choice and do whats right to keep people safe, not to make their lives easier.  In conclusion, driverless cars are not a good idea. Maybe in the distant future if more problems that we are currently dealing with are resolved, but not at this time. Driverless cars are not currently safe, and will not be for many years to come. They would cost a significant amount of money, money that can be spent elsewhere for better causes, especially when we already have cars that work perfectly fine. Finally, driverless cars are not a good idea because they could cause people to forget how to drive a regular car, which could lead to a very dangerous and potentially deadly situation. There are benefits of driverless cars, however there are even more downfalls to the idea that certainly outweigh the benefits.       Technology should not be relied on for big tasks like driving. Car companies are being thourough and making sure they are safe, but technology, even today, still seems to occasionally mess up. In the article it says, \"Most drvining laws focus on keeping drivers, passengers, and pedestrians safe, and lawmakers know that safety is best achieved with alert drivers.\" I agree that the best way to ensure safety is with a driver that is focused and knowledged. These driverless cars could potentially be dangerous to us. If the car messes up even once, or the company makes a mistake in the programming, we could definately be in great danger. Safety is the most important thing, and because we can never be 100% sure that technology won't mess up, we should not have driverless cars in the future.  Let's say someone is in a wreck and later come to find the car had failed them, who is responsible now? The manufacturer. The car could fail out of nowhere with no warning signs and even cost someone their life. Though there have been studies, a driverless car could have a potential downfall affect on drivers. Some could feel like they can be lazy and not have to worry about their surroundings and cause an accident that way; A person could even fall asleep at the wheel and do more damage than good. Some states make it illegal to even drive computer-type cars because of a law they have.  These driveless cars I've been telling you about won't make this world any better.  Imagine Earth being invaded by robots. That's right, the new apacolypse. You see these can be extremely dangerous to the environment and the people inside the car. This new technology can't be acurate. There can be some huge change in it that you won't see it coming from two inches away.

The text also states in paragraph 6 line 10 that ;\"Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communcation,\"notes Dr. Huang.\". This example actually explains alot of real world issues in the classroom, such as the fact that some students refuse to even try to communicate their confusion or boredom in the classroom so then they often disengage in the lesson and miss every part that would be essential to reaching standards created by the state.  Dr. Huang is talking about how it can change the ads you see and veiw if you dont look happy when you look at them. Dr. Huang states \"For example when a web ad appears on your screen and you smile a similar ad may follow, But if you frown the next ad will be different. A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,\" Dr. Huang predicts. This Quote and prediction of Dr. Huang states that is has potential to keep students intrestred into work  Dr. Huang also explains that \"the facial expressions for each emotion are universal\" reguardless of the desgree of expression, (D'Alto). Finally, the fear of more computer based activities is rapidly squashed by the contradiction that being more aware should envoke more human interaction, not lesson it.  In the article, Nick D'Alto used a quote from Dr. Huang which was \"'A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,' Dr. Huang predicts. 'Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor.  For example,\" a classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,\" Dr. huang predicts. \" Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instrucuture.\" This is really helpful to some students because when taking an online lesson some of them might be comfused and the teacher is no there to help. So the computer can take these facial expresions and modify the lesson so you could undestand it better. This also follows along if a student needs help with the lesson, the computer could see you are having a hard time and t to help you by changing the lesson  In the text, the excerpt, \"'A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming cofused or bored,' Dr. Huang predicts,\" shows that student's attention could be analyazed. (D'Alto, 6). With this being done, if the computer would be able to recgonize confusion, the student could then be introduced to a better way to learn the material or a way that they beter understand it, then leading to better grades. (D'Alto, 6). Also, the grades of the students could improve based on what the computer decides to do with as much human touch as it can. The passage, \"'Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor,'\" shows that there is a solution to any problems a kid may have with what they are learning. (D'Alto 6). The fact that the computer attempts to try and help the students with a human touch shows that it would have the capibilties to do it's best and help the students to learn better, overall improving the student's grades. (D'Alto 6). With both of these examples in mind, it can be seen that the inclusion of this sytem into classrooms would have the capability to improve both a student's grades and understanding.  In the passage, the article states that a classroom computer could recognize a stuudent becoming confused or bored (Dr. Huang). After that, it could modify the lesson similar to what an effective human instructor could do  Often in school, students become bored easily, due to lack of attention long attention spans, uninteresting lessons, or boring teachers. This technology could help eliminate bordom. In the article, Dr. Huang states that \"a classroom computer could recognize when a student... [is] bored\" which would be beneficial, as it \"could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor.\" This means that this technology could tell if students are bored, and could alert the teacher. If teachers knew when their students were loosing focus and becoming uninterested in the lesson, they could change it to bring students back on focus, which would improve the productivity and use of time in the classroom because teachers would not be wasting time teaching students who are uninterested, and therefore, likely not listening. By eliminating this bordom factor, teachers would be more effective with their teaching time, and students would recieve a better quality of learning.  This can be seen in the text when it says, \" A classroom computer could recognize when a stuent is becoming confused or bored,\" Dr Huang predicts. \"Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor,\"\" (D'Alto 6). This exemplifies that the schools want to use this technology to help students learn more effectively by using technology thats like a teacher. For some students this may cause trouble if they make facial expressions, but it's not about the lesson. Such as if a student is told something by another student and the student looks confused, the computer might see that and think they dont understand the lesson. Then it would modify the lesson for the student even if the student understood it just fine. A teacher would be much better at understanding the students emotions in a certain situation than technology.  In the education world, teachers are the backbone of the infestructure. Without teachers, the whole system would collapse. However, it may be hard for one teacher to connect with every student individually and make sure they are learning properly or if they are paying attention. This is where FACS comes in. In the article \"Making Mona Lisa Smile\", Dr. Huang talks about FACS in classrooms more in depth, \"'A classroom computer could recgonize when a student is becoming confused or bored,' Dr. Huang predicts. 'Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human istructor.'\" ",

                "content": "According to source one, \"What Is The Electoral College?\", each political party has it's own set of electors that equal the amount of congressional delegates per state. Usually each state has a \"winner-take-all\" method, so the presidential candidate that gets majority in your state will get all of the electors that represent their party, not just most of them. This is beneficicial to the outcome of the election becuase it makes the ability for a candiate to get majority vote much simpler. There is less of a possibility of a tie, or an outcome where no candidate wins. Source 3, \"In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep out despised method of choosing president\", states that \"even a very slight plurality in a state creates a landslide electoral-vote victory in that state...\" , therefore allowing the candidate to secure all votes to their side, instead of having the votes divided on the line of majority rule, and causing rifts between Electoral College voters.   In the article, \"The Indefensible Electoral College: Why event the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong,\" Bradford Plumer quotes, \"Under the electoral college sytem, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president.\" This is not how a republic is supposed to run. People are supposed to be granted the opportunity to elect the president of their choice, not of somebody elses. The most popular vote would take into consideration of every citizen's opinion with a direct percentage of votes to elect a certain candidate. In the article, \"In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President,\" Richard A. Posner states, \"The Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal. No region (South, Northeast, etc.) has enough electoral votes to elect a president.\" This may be true but if the most popular vote system was put into place, there would be an even more exact number of how many people voted for each candidate. The Electoral College does not voice the opinions of all citizens because in reality, a person is not directly voting for their desired candidate. They are voting for other representatives that will hopefully, in turn, elect the candidate they want. Obviously, the Electoral College is definitely a system that should be abolished in the United States of America.  In \"Source 3: In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President\", author Richard A. Posner explains that the Electoral College \"restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment of the Senate decreed in the Constitution.\" The Electoral College gives larger states more attention from presidential candidates as opposed to a smaller state. Posner continues the idea with \"the most thoughtful voters should be the ones to decide the election.\" To break it down, voters who pay close attention to the campaign will be the most thoughtful voters and they will recieve the most attention from the candidates. This reduces the amount of disputes because the presidential candidates will decide on who to give the most attention to.  Look at \"In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President\" Mitt Romney doesn't campaign in the South part of the United States since he knows that he is popular in that region with the electors he doesn't bother camapigning there since he knows he will win their votes. But he has to campaign to other states and regions since he knows the South doesn't have enough power to make him president. And with that comes your swing states and the big states. Swing states listen to what the presidental candidates have to say since they are toss-up states. These swing states literally can \"swing\" the election. These are the states that are going to decide who the next president is. And that ties in with your big states; California, Texas, Florida, New York, and Pennsylvania are some of your big states since they have the most population out of the United States. These states can also be swing states since they have the most votes out of every state. With the power of the popular vote a presidental canidate can become president, and other regions will not have a say. But using the Electoral College that can't happen.  Mr. Richard A. Posner states in his article \"  In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President\"  that we avoid run-off elections. \"  The Electoral College avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast. For example, Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992 both had only a 43 percent of plurality of the popular votes, while winning a majority in the Electotal College (301 and 370 electoral votes, respectively).There is pressure for run-off elections when no candidate wins a majority of the votes cast; that pressure, which would greatly complicate the presidential election process, is reduced by the Electoral College, which invariably produces a clear winner....\"  The importance in the counterclaim is that it shows that the Electoral College process had a clear winner.  The popular voting method is directly controlled by the people and their vote is sent directly to their desired candidate. On the other side, by using the electoral college method voters vote for a select member of the state's electoral college votes and that member is\u00a0 elgible to vote for any presidential candidate of their choice. According to the article \"In Defense of the Electoral College: Five Reasons to keep our Despised Method of Choosing the President\" by Richard A. Posner, \" when you vote for a presidential candidate you are actually voting for a slate of electors.\" Further evidence from this article (quote on quote) claims there is a \" lack of democratic pedigree.\" Electoral voting also only benefits the larger states because of there is a\u00a0 larger amount of members of the electoral college for the\u00a0 larger states.  By this the number is much smaller since each country is weighed and is worth certain points and decided by electors you choosed to trust to vote for the same president you did. You still are in control just that you choose somebody he/her is not likely to change his or her mind and vote for the exact person you want he or she to vote for. It stated in the article that \"Each candidate running for president in your state has his or her own group of electors. The electors are generally chosen by the candiate's politcal party.\" I say that if the candidate political party chooses the electors then they must be good and the party must be sure the elector won't change his mind out of no where.  In an article by Richard A. Posner called \"In Defense Of The Electoral College:Five Reasons To Keep Our Despised Method Of ChoosingThe President\" he says \"nixon in 1968 and clinton in 1992 both had only a 43 percent plurality of the popular votes, while winning a majority in the Electoral College (301 and 370). There is pressure for run off elections when no candidate wins a majority of the votes cast; the presidential election process, is reduced by the electoral college, which invaribly produces a clear winner.\"     Also in \"In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the Presiden\" (Paragraph 22)take Richard Nixon's and Bill Clinton's presidental campaign. Those two only won 43% of their popular votes but they won their elections with the Electoral College. Without the Electoral College all three of these presides wouldn't have become President of the United States.  In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President\", author Richard A. Posner states that \"knowing [the voters'] vote has no effect [gives them] less incentitive to pay attention to the campaign.\" But, \"voters in presidential electons are people who want to express\u00a0 political preference rather than people who think that a single vote may decide and election.\" This means thatchanging everyone to a single vote will have no effect, too because people will not put thought into who to vote, but they will just vote for whoever.

I know for a fact that I have once suffered as I thought someone had stolen my phone and I wouldn't get it back, I knew that if I would tell a teacher the whole class would be punished until someone came forward and even then my parents would be mad unless that person would get suspended or expelled.  Another external issue that can cause harm or cancel school for students is when schools are under reconstruction which creates distractions and hazardous areas within the school that can threaten the safety of the student body.  As a student, one of the worst situations is one where an assignment is given that is unclear, vague, or otherwise difficult to understand. Completing projects is usually a laborsome enough\u00a0activity on its own, but when the question or prompt is incomprehensible, it turns a small hill of a task into a mountain of one. Too many students have been in this situation and know what it is like to be immeasurably confused and frustrated because the assignment is too difficult to interpret. To make matters worse, students quite often do not know how to contact their teachers during the summer, so they are given no help or clarity as to what they are supposed to do.  The danger in this scenario is that when a student becomes uninterested in what they are learning, it causes the student to not pay attention and stop doing work because of the lack of strive to learn. Not only does this situation cause a strain on the student who did not do his or her work, and the teacher, but also the other students in the class. The other students are also effected, because the teacher is now required to take the time out of the new lessons to re-teach what should have already been learned. To prevent this lack of gusto, summer projects should be chosen by the students so they can pick a topic that makes them want to learn.  I also think it could be a punishment for students who misbehave  If something terrible were to happen to a students family, they should be able to contact the student immediately. How could they do so without a cell phone? This also true if it were backwards, and there was an emergency at school. If something were to happen that left the school's administration physically unable to hell the students, how could students get help? With cell phones, they would be able to contact their families and emergency medical services.  The only reason that a student should have to do the community service when they are not in a club is if they got into some kind of trouble at school or during something related to school/on school grounds or if they accumulate so much detention that they don't make up another choice should be community service.  They could take out and use their phones when teachers are not watching, and use them without being noticed. And when somebody gets caught, they just get angry at the school and have their parents come up to the school to get back the confiscated phone. This will give you no progress, as students would still use their phones in class and just get them taken away. Even if they have the chance of getting caught, they would still text or call somebody if they felt that it was something important.  When forced to do something a persons natural reaction is to strike out against or oppose it. The students might start to feel this way such as convicts who are assigned community service by the state do. If this happens the service will be done poorly with little effort and the feelings that are supposed to come from it will be pushed away.  My friend Generic_Name was sick not that long ago with the flu, and missed all of her classes for a week straight. Even though she did her work, her grade and attendance suffered because she wasnt able to show up to class, and most of the absences were unexcused. If classes were online, she would be able to log on, and get her attendance points, and her points from the curriculum. People could disagree and say that students would get lazy, and not long onto the program to do their work, however those students would still have to face the consequences of a lower grade and possible detention,or a mark off for not signing into the programs. Its really the same as a regular class, it just offers the comfort of home, and personal resources and still gives students the opportunity to get the help they need. ",

But it's these flaws that the popular vote dosen't have that makes it a less valid way to decide something as important as presidency.  In conclusion, the electoral college was the most efficient and sucessful way to vote, back in the 1700-1800. However, with current communication and transportation technologies, the College has become obsolete, to the point where it should be buried at a crossroads with a stake through it's heart. It is unfair, biased, impractical, and just overall worthless. We should put our newfound technology and knowledge to use and do away with the electoral College, once and for all.      There is pleanty of things wrong in this world, but one thing that is pretty good right now is the Electoral College. More times than not it has one winner and one loser, and rarely a tie. It makes sure that nobody is a favorite or feels like it. Also it shows things can change if something is a problem or needs fixing. The Electoral College is not perfect, but is not broken. Thank you for reading my letter, I hope you take it into concideration when deciding to keep it or not.   While some may still believe that the Electoral College is outdated and unneccesary, the usefulness of the swing states, its transregional approval system, and its certainty over popular voting proves it to be the best method of selecting our presidents for now and for the future.       \u00a0       \u00a0     Additionally, the Electoral College sould be kept in today's democracy because is allocates power to the larger states  The electoral college is something that has been loved, hated, and debated on for some years now. We couold abolish it or keep it the way it is. Some say the electoral college is undemocratic and unfair to the voters and the candidates. But some say it is the best way to vote.  In conclusion, the electoral college is ineffective and outdated. we should no longer use this as a system of defining our president. Even though a winner is often more clear, there is still a possibility of a tie between candidates. People who support the Electoral College also argue that its a good thing due to swing states having more attention payed to them and therefore being more careful in their decision. However, this reasoning is flawed in that it assumes that citizens of a state are more likely to inform theirselves thouroughly simply because their vote holds more value, in a sense. Also, candidates would no longer pay special attention to swing states if the electoral college weren't in place so the votes of these citizens wouldn't be held above the rest. Increased value of votes is not a good thing, which this argument also assume. It is the best decision to abolish the Electoral College.    \"At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters. because of the winner-takes-all system in each state canidates dont spend time in states they spend no time in stats the know thy wont win.\" Some states can get no canidates out and its because the electoral college is unfair. \"It`s official: The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. The best argumants in favor of it are mostly assertions without much basis in reality. And the arguments against direct election ar spurios at best. Its hard to say but Bob Dole was right: Abolish the electoral college!\" This Quote states that the electoral college is not fair and down right rediculus  The electoral college is not only obsolete, unnesessary and parasitic, but also unfair to many voters. The main ways this unfairness can be identified are extreme, and each really deserve a paragraph of their own. Let us imagine a scenario: a democrat lives in a mostly republican state  In summation, the Electoral College has been around for hundreds of years, but it is time that the United States makes the change that would improve the way of electing its future Presidents. The Electoral College is outdated and complicated, does not allow the voice of the people to be heard, and leads to uneccessary voting complications. For these reasons, I vehemently feel that we should switch from the Electoral College to election by popular vote.       \u00a0 ",

                "content": "So, while some conspiracy theorists would like to think that aliens created this well-known face on Mars, they are incorrect. The face on Mars is just a natural landform that was wrongly perceived by the public. By advancing in digital technology, understanding the effect of shadows, and realizing that there is no evidence to support aliens on Mars, it can be concluded that the face on Mars is just another peculiar natural landform.  So in conclusion it is not a alien made face it simply in a mesa or a landmark on Mars. The proof is in the article when you see the 3 picutes that were taken to prove it wasn't a alien made artifact. No matter how cool it would be if it was not to mention that it could make NASA famous or rich it just doesn't have the proof you need to be a alien artifact. If you look more into the passage it even says it was not a alien made artiffact. Yes this face was very famous it even says \"The \"Face\" on Mars has since been a pop icon. It has starred in a Hollywood film, apperered in books, magazines, and even radio shows.\" (5). See how famous that face was 25 years ago is amazing but it still doesn't mean it was a alien made artiffact. So in final say it is not a alien made face and nor will there be enough proof its just a landmark on Mars that was very popular to people everywhere!            In conclusion, some people may think there is alien life on Mars because of past picture or conspiracy theories. No one can denty however, that NASA has proven the Face to be nothing but a natural landform on the Red Planet Mars. NASA has proven this by recent pictures, scientific evidence, and real-life examples and measurements. Over the years, NASA has worked hard to figure out the mystery of the face, and just recently they have discovered, with pictyures, evidence, and measruements, that the Face is just a natural landform with unusual shadowing formed on the Red Planet Mars.  It does look like it could be from another living organism, but it's just a rock on the planet. In our newest image of the rock, it turns out that the face has dissapered. There is no evidence of this being created by aliens, rather it was created by wind and water that has been found on Mars. The reason you might believe that this was indeed aliens, might be the fact that the news has blown it out of poportion. It's just the rock that had some interesting shadows and holes that made it look like a human face.  In 1976 the face looked like a face. In 1998 it started to not look like a face at all. In 2001 it just looked like a rock. So i believe that it was not created by aliens but that it was just something the olanet had made itself. This has certainly got the attention of the people.  The \"Face on Mars\" is not a face. If you look at the pictures from 1976, and 1998, and 2001 and in the text it says that the photo from 2001 is the most recent photo that NASA has. It still looks nothing like a face so since the 2001 picture is the most recent it shows that it is just a natural landform. It is just a natural landform. On Mars there are natural landforms everywhere and the fade away. Here on earth natural landforms are created everyday.  I find it highly unrealistic that NASA would even have been able to determine what the Face was forty years ago, much less hiding a discovery of extra-terrestrial life that could make a huge profit for the space program. And, had NASA really claimed that the Face was an object built by otherworldly life, surely someone would let the cat out of the bag. Not to mention that, if the vast majority of NASA believed it was an alien monument, do you really think that they would wait eighteen years to investigate the subject again? On top of all of this, it's simply illogical that aliens would create such a thing. As far as we all know, the supposed \"aliens\" on Mars have never come in contact with a human, much less seen one. That only leaves possible explanation; aliens created a monument that of which coincedentally resembles a human head. An absolute coincedence.  The author states that scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa when the face appeared. This shows that they have seen things like this before and they knew that it wasn't real, or alien like. Another example that the author proves is that Garvin said it reminded him of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. The camera on board MGS had to peer through wispy clouds to see the face and perhaps alien markings were hidden by haze. Also NASA can be hidding information about the Face. But, you can see that the Face is formed by shadows, and not an alien haze.  About twenty-five years ago, something happened around Mars. NASA, snapped photos of the object. On Mars, there is a face printed on the plant. People think it was created by aliens. NASA said it was created on it's own. Scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa. Those are common around Cydonia. A couple of days later NASA saw a nose, eyes, and a mouth.  With all of the technology used to investigate the red planet, proof of alien life should have already been found. Jim Garvin, chief scientist for NASA's Mars Exploration Program explained, \"As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size...So, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!\" By stating this, Garvin is saying that if there was any evidence of aliens builing this face on Mars, it would have been found.  There you have it. The Face sadly wasn't built by aliens, it was just a natural landform that happened to have some pretty neat features to it due to shadows. There is no way around it, because the pictures don't lie. It is even more obvious that it is a landform because ones just like it exist on Earth! Even though it would've been very interesting for it to have been actually created by aliens, it was just a natural landform in the end. ",

                "content": "Students may need to take care of family members right after they leave school.  Most of us, as human beings, need other's help for certain things. Whether that be for school work or friendship advises, we all need someone's help at least\u00a0once in our lives. When we are uncertain of something, we often times ask for help from the people around us  Hanging out with friends, going out for a coffee, or watching a movie are among the minor things that relieve stress from the life of an average teenager. School can undoubtedly be physically and mentally draining. Therefore, spending a couple hours per week socializing and hanging with friends can help a student immensely. However, these minuscule ways of staying happy can all be taken away when a student is required to make time for an extracurricular activity  Schools have a day where both teachers and students can meet in order to do missing work or get the extra help they need. My school for example offers a specific class called lancer time where kids get a pass from their teachers and go to them for any reason possible. If you still need help then you can stay after school on a specific day and there is transportation provided. This is very convenient because if at any given moment a student needs help with something they can go and get it. Home schooled students don't have this option because they are being taught at home and arent' attending a school. This is very inconvenient because what would happen if a student needs help with something, they won't be able to get the help they need. If you attend a physical school then it's going to be very easy for you to get the help you need whenever you need it. Another way is by going to a class full of people you can get someone, like a friend, to help you and then you can both compare work to see if you are doing it right. If you're home schooled then you don't really have the option to have your friend\u00a0help you or have any way of making sure your work is correct. That being said it's better for students to go to an actual physical school, so that they are able to get the help they need in order to succeed.  Attending school practically takes up our entire day, and our entire lives. By the time we get up, get ready, travel to school, attend class, then come home to do additional homework, or entire day is gone. Additionally, we also spend five of the seven days of the week attending class, and those other two days of the weekend are overwhelmed with more homework. What about those who live far away? If they were at home, they would actually be able to get more work done as their commute time is absent. Where is their time allotted to spend time with family when your whole life is centered around school? Lastly, what about those who have a mental illness, that disables them to attend school for a whole day?  Maybe once a every two months the students could go to a community center and help the homeless, such as feed them and talk to them.  Everyone has them, students and faculty alike. Some families live out of state or in other countries, causing students to be forced to miss weeks at a time. Throughout these weeks, the students would miss many lectures, assignments, tests, quizzes and important projects. Allowing those who are gone to stay on top by using a computer, would allow students to focus more on their family in a time of worry, instead of worrying how they are going to make up their test in their third period math class. The stress of having a family emergency on top of the already extremely stress inducing schoolwork, can become too much for many, leaving them exhausted and unable to catch up. The inability to catch up for some, can cause them to drop out of school all together, as the stress and pressure would build and build up. This can ruin students' futures and take a lot of opportunities out of their hands.  Like if you play sports and have practice from right after school to about 5:30 and then you try to do community service.  For example, my friend lives in her apartment with her older sister who is diagnosed with cancer but still works almost everyday to provide for her family, her cousin who is mentally disabled and cannot work, and her mom who has a medical condition where she has trouble walking. My friend sometimes has to leave school early just to go to her job and works eight hour shifts, five days a week and stays up to do her homework or sometimes isn't able to complete it. Online school or video conferencing would save drastic amounts of time in order for her to be able to work more to provide for her family and be able to pay for online school and make meals for her family, while still getting her education. Overall, online school would be a better option for some students whose family situations may need a little more attention than others  think that if you didn't have the students at our school do community service you would be doing them a great injustice. When we are so privileged to have a nice home, clean water, and a meal on the table every night we should at least be able to go out for an our or two and help someone else who isn't as privileged. Its hardly a great burden to get up from the computer or desk you are at, put on a pair of old jeans and a t-shirt, and go out and help. So I ask only one thing of you; please set aside one day, one measly day, to have all of the students in our school wander out into the community and help someone. ",

                "content": "For example, look at this study that the Social Interaction and Communication Association took at a local middle school. When Students were pushed, or put out of their comfort zone to more things with others, they talked around 30% more than they use to, and had 45% easier time making friends with others. This shows that pushing these kids to talk to others more, or easing them out of their comfort zone, can really help them find people they can depend on. Showing that doing something like this can really be good for them. There isn't just that, there is also more evidence that proves this point! Generic_Name, A Counselor at Generic_School, Had this to say about pushing kids to do activities to meet new people \"There is usually a reason kids can be like this, it's because they haven't found the group of people that understand them, when pushed though, they can find those people, and feel like they belong,\". This shows that, from what Generic_Name observed, the students can find their people if they have someone help them try something new, and that they just need that little push to find them.  Making new friends is bound to happen while doing extracurricular activities, you and another person are just going to click and get along with each other very well. Making friends with the people that do the same extracurricular as you can have a lot of benefits. Take this for example; I play football and my friend Generic_name doesn't. So when I try telling Generic_name about the struggles that I am going through on the football team or something important about the team, he can't help me with my problem because he is not involved. But, if I have a friend on the team then he can help me with my problems and I can also help with his or her problems. Overall, extracurricular activities help make friends that can help you through things.  To elaborate, drama, or theater, involves everyone to communicate with each other to create a scene that will dazzle the audience. They must decide how to react, talk, and act to one another to make the performance truly spectacular.  Additionally, students don't just see their classmates when they go to their chosen activity, there are other kids from other grades there as well, so it's the perfect chance to meet unfamiliar people, and chat with familiar people, too. To add to that, the activity likely brings out skills in others that you didn't know they had, and that enables students to connect with one another and find out more about each other.  When you join an extracurricular activity, you're put in situations where you must work with and cooperate with others. This type of interaction gives students the chance to meet and connect with new people. Most activities like these use team efforts. For example, activities like Science Olympiad require you to collaborate with others in order to win competitions, it helps you both get along with others and develop teamwork skills. Overall, this can help with your future in situations where you work alongside co-workers. You can even make close friends through extracurricular activities. The students there most likely will share similar interests because they are all participating in an activity that focuses on a certain field that they probably enjoy. Sports teams, for example, give people opportunities to work with others who are very passionate about the same sport that they are. Teammates have to cooperate with each other\u00a0and work together in order to accomplish tasks. This is similar to most other extracurricular activities, they can help you form bonds with your peers that can last a lifetime.\u00a0This chance to socialize with others is only one of the reasons I would agree with the prinicpal's decision to make students participate in extracurriculars  Most activity leaders allow field trips at least once a year. As an effect, students get to go places they've never been before, and if they have, they get to share their experience at that place with different people. Also, multiple activities, such as art, teach students to make certain things. In artistic cases, you get to learn about pottery, clay, watercolor and acrylic painting, different drawing tools, and more. In addition, music lets you explore your voice, public speaking lets you learn how to be a motivational speaker, marching band lets you play more pieces of music with your instrument, and experience more with it, and so many more activities teach you a variety of different things.  Generic_Name is a part of his high school's student council. Part of his job is to work with others to cultivate ideas for school programs. The council has taught him the importance of expressing his opinions and ideas. The council has made Evan much more confident about his opinions and now expresses them throughout daily life. A student council is not the only activity that can boost your communication skills. Those skills will increase anywhere that\u00a0you are working together, which is usually any activity. By improving your communication skills, you are preparing for the future. You will need to be able to have excellent communication skills during college, work, and just daily life. In addition, you could make many friends. According to the Brain Like Mindedness Observation Assessments, people with the same interests typically make better friends. A club is just a bunch of people gathered together doing an activity that they enjoy. There are plenty of chances to make a friend. So next time nobody wants to join a club with you, don't worry. Once you get there you will make many friends.  The Department of Youth Statistics stated that one of the best ways for students to make friends is by letting students choose what activities to do and pairing those with similar interests together. That is exactly what clubs do. Furthermore, it is proven by the University of Psychology that when students have a healthy amount of friends, they are less likely to fail their classes and more likely to succeed. Based on that, extracurricular activities can cause students to be more successful than their peers who do not partake in those activities.   Extracurricular activities can be the thing that a student looks forward to doing that day, counting down the hours and minutes until school ends. They are a great place to interact with others and develop an interest or skill,\u00a0where lasting friendships can be made outside of a student's normal social circles.\u00a0The students have a greater control over how things are run, providing kids the chance to step into leadership roles. However, they are not for everyone.  To summarize, because students get to socialize with people they never got the opportunity to talk to before, experience new things and get taught new skills, and impact the community as well as themselves, I believe extracurricular activities should definitely be included at our school. They are a very bright part of anyone's day, something that a kid could look forward to on a boring Monday. Also, they could find out new things they didn't have a clue about. A teen gets to talk to others near their age group who started out just being part of a crowd, but because they met them while playing the part of Juliet, they turned into a best friend. Additionally, we get to help the whole state while having a incredible time. So whether it's the applause of an audience at a play, the encouraging comment of a friend on a picture, or the announcement of a score it took a team effort to achieve, the activity that got someone there made a mark on their heart.  Cooperation is a skill which gives people the ability to build upon each others strengths and weaknesses, and is the source of many significant discoveries. Often we see that the scientific community caters to its researchers by promoting peer-reviewed journals and research to be conducted. This sentiment holds true with education in America. In order for students to learn over the summer, they should be encouraged to produce their own projects with individuals whom they spend their time with during the summer. I recall being pestered by taking on the burden of conducting a lab report by myself, which caused me to feel stressed out and disengaged. One day in physics class, my teacher allowed me to conduct a lab with many of my friends to make the lab procedure dynamic. I found that by being with my contemporaries, I was inclined to learn more about physics, and to collect accurate and precise data. Students who create their own projects are allowed the opportunity to learn through cooperation, which betters suits them especially during summer break. Many students are already flustered by the work load they receive during the school year, furthermore projects in summer break should bring students together in learning not steer them away in frustration.

                "content": "While the Facial Action Coding System detects facial expressions that indicate a person's emotion, the system built in a classroom computer is valuable to students, because it can manipulate the lesson based on how students are learning.  However, on the technological aspect, how can one know how reliable a computer is on detecting somebody's facial expression?  Dr. Huang is talking about how it can change the ads you see and veiw if you dont look happy when you look at them. Dr. Huang states \"For example when a web ad appears on your screen and you smile a similar ad may follow, But if you frown the next ad will be different. A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,\" Dr. Huang predicts. This Quote and prediction of Dr. Huang states that is has potential to keep students intrestred into work  Computers don't have emotions, but you do! Imagine technology that seriously works for you, not only at home but also in the classroom! If technology could accurately read human facial expressions the learning possibilities could be endless. For example, think about that one story that you're forced to read that you just can't understand and brings out all your frustrations, with facial expression recognition you probably will never be so frustated again.  Based on the evidence given in the article, the use of Facial Action Coding Stystems in the classroom would be wildly valuable. The computer can detect many levels of emotion to accomodate their program to the students' needs. If a particular lesson bores a student or that student has lack of focus, the computer can adjust and change many aspects of thier layout to catch the student's attention. Also, students can receive the correct level of work- whether that be too easy or too hard. And not only can students benefit, but teachers, as well. They can track student progress to further accomodate their needs. While technology can be used for many unethical things, the Facial Action Coding System would be extremely effective in a school setting.      In the article \"Making Mona Lisa Smile,\" the author explains how certain algorithms built into a system, called the Facial Action Coding System, can detect human emotions. In the article, the author describes how a classroom computer can recognize when a student is getting bored or confused based on their facial expressions. This computer can change the way that the lesson is being taught so that the students are more productive in classes.  I know that there are some down falls to this technology what if the student or the person doesn't have a problem and just has a face that makes it look like he/she has a problem.  They may lie about not doing their homework or be untruthful about whether they were involved in a fight. The FACS machine could solve that issue as it is able to determine whether someone is lying or not based on their expression which is stated in the quote,\" To an expert, faces don't lie; these muscle clues are sometimes used to spot when a \"smiling\" politician or celebrity isn't being truthful.\" This machine is able to examine the details of one's face to find out if they are lying or not. It examines the key traits of each specific emotion and if they are not meant, that is how it knows whther the truth has been told or not. Students will no longer bee able to weasel their way out of punishment due to their superior lying skills as the FACS machine is able to see through the lies. This is not the only thing this machine can do though for schools.  According to the article \"Making Mona Lisa Smile,\" there is a new technology called the Facial Action Coding System (FACS) that enables computers to identify human emotions. This technology is relatively brand new. It creates a 3-D computer model of all fourty-four major muscles in the face that move like human muscles as well. Then, psychologists have classified six basic emotions that are associated with different movements in the facial mucles. This new technology could result in many benefits in our community as well as all around the world  For example,\" a classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,\" Dr. huang predicts. \" Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instrucuture.\" This is really helpful to some students because when taking an online lesson some of them might be comfused and the teacher is no there to help. So the computer can take these facial expresions and modify the lesson so you could undestand it better. This also follows along if a student needs help with the lesson, the computer could see you are having a hard time and t to help you by changing the lesson ",

Also when the students are back in school and they have to present their projects, the other students might not even pay attention to their classmates presenting, because they would already know the information that is going to be said. The classmates that I've talk to in my school state to my that they have more fun with a project when they get to pick their own topic to choose from, and tend to pay attention more to when their classmates present different projects topics.  Students would not be able to work on any assignments or share any information with other students and would have to work alone. Students would not be able to join school sports, to be part of a team or to just be a little active instead of staying in your house all day, or attend other after school activities that would allow students to socialize and learn about more information that other schools provide after school. Students would lose the opportunity to stay after school with the teacher and ask questions and ask for help.  They will not learn the material they need and therefore won't succeed in the future when they need the information regarding the material the most. Furthermore, schools should have the option of attending classes through online means because the student may be sick. It is common for students to get sick once a while and therefore cannot come to school and must stay home to avoid the risk of getting others sick with things like the flu. So, if their school had the option to attend a class using an online resource, the student could be at home recovering while still learning the material they need.   A student who comes inside on her snow day to work on homework, watch lessons, and turn everything in on time, but gets back to school and listen to the same lesson again because her peers did not learn the information, is wasting her time.  The students who do not do the assignment are also wasting the time of the teacher who made the lessons and assignments.  For the students who might attempt to do the work, there is nothing stopping them from sitting on their phone during online lectures and nothing stopping them from searching for answers online, making distance learning completely ineffective  Many students do not do the homework assigned while in class when the directions are given to them in person, so they will not put in the extra effort from home.   Self-motivated learning is when the student has a desire to learn and therefore works hard to learn information without having to be pushed by their teachers. The truth is that while teachers can relay all the necessary information to students, if the students don't want anything to do with it they will learn far less effectively than students who do want to learn. By asking students to create their own summer assignment, it forces them into a new learning environment in which they have to take charge of their learning. Upon being put into this position, students will have to adapt to learn how to teach themselves information. This is a very valuble life skill that will be very helpful to them later in their lives, as self-education is needed for many things that are not taught in school as well as in the workplace. Motivating themselves is an important skill that can be taught through student-designed summer work.  For example if the classes were not prerecorded or all written down and you had to listen to a teacher talk online, if you miss any information you wouldn't be able to communicate directly to the teacher for some time and wouldn't be able to ask questions until after the lesson. If the class was thought through notes online then students would't be able to communicate with the teacher directly and would have to email them which would take time for them to respond. Students need to think about the information they are learning and not asking questions and making connections, could hurt students when they are taking a test.   Some students might not know a lot of information about the school they're attending. But with these activities students can connect with their teachers and staff on a deeper level and get to know them more. This could also help them in the classroom. By knowing more about their school they could contribute to making their school a better learning, safe, and fun environment to be in. This is how being in an extracurricular activity can help students get to know their school, the people that work there, and make the school a better environment.  This would've needed to be done, had learning been set in a classroom setting. For example, a student may not understand a concept in math and want to try and fully understand the concept before being tested on it. In schools currently, many students are being forced to take tests having not have comprehended the topic of study. This also leads to the problem of social influence on a students learning. As humans, we tend to conform to the rest of society and value deeply what society has to say about us. Students self-esteem and self-efficacy go down when they don't understand a topic. Students tend to not want to be the outcast when it comes to not understanding a topic, so they just go ahead with a test, which results in them doing poorly on because not enough time was given to them. Online school provides this option, so a student is not given a test before they thoroughly understand the concept  Every year, thousands of students are forced to stay home for extended periods of time due to physical or mental illness or other individual reasons. These students, while they are oftentimes provided worksheets and assignments, are quite prone to falling behind in terms of the material. If they are not at school and at the lessons each and every day, it is extremely easy to lose awareness of the material being taught, especially if the only outlet for their learning is a packet of worksheets with practice problems. Without a teacher and peers, these students do not have access to immediate feedback on mistakes or teachers who are able to answer their questions. However, with distance learning, long-term home bound\u00a0students would be able to work alongside their peers. They could engage in online activities and applications that would strengthen their knowledge of the material, while also allowing them to interact with their teacher and peers. Especially when it comes to video conferencing, students who cannot physically attend school would still be able to ask their teacher questions in person and potentially have private lessons. It is never a student's fault if they are unable to come to school due to an illness; therefore, it should not be difficult to learn if that is the case.  While the student receives the school materials they need, they do not get to participate in discussion or attend lectures that help to solidify the information. But with distance learning, the student is able to participate in class online while they cannot be physically present. ",

                "content": "Sebastian Thrun, founder of the self driving Google car, said, \"There was no way, before 2000, to make something interesting. The sensors weren't there...Radar was a device on a hilltop that cost two hundred million dollars.\" In fact, alot of the technologies, including radar, used in self driving cars have been around for a long time. However, in recent years, they have become alot cheaper and precise, so that the dream of creating a self driving car is a reality. The goal of the self driving car was never to create a billion dollar high tech vehicle accessible only to the rich, but one that could be mass produced and avaliable to all. With cheaper, mass produced technology, it seems like this is not too far up the road.  We have had extreneous experience with sensors and radar, two things that are almost required for a driverless car in the upcoming future, to make one. In the 1980's, more than 30 years ago, automakers used speed sensors at the wheels in the creation of antilock brakes (Ph. 5). With all of the experience gained, we now can make real driverless cars. Infact, we all ready have. Google has had cars that could drive independently under specific conditions since 2009 (Ph. 2). Their cars have driven more than half a million miles without a crash, but roadblocks and problems do lie ahead for a true \"driverless car\".  This is becuase of all of the safety features that are equipted in driverless cars.  They contain a numerous amount of sensors and alert systems. If there was something that would harm you while in the driverless car, the car would either be able to get out of the situation more effectively than an experienced driver, or would be able to alert the driver to take over and the driver would manually get out of the situation.  In the passage it says that the Google driverless cars contain many sensors. Some of those sensors include, the sensor on the left rear wheel, a rotating sensor on the roof, a camera mounted near the rearview mirror, four automotive radar sensors, a GPS reciever, and an inertial motion sensor.  This shows first hand how safe the driverless cars are. The Driverless cars have so many built in sensors that even the most dangerous situation can be avoided while in a driverless car.  Driverless cars require sensors which allow them to mimic human reaction to whatever situation might arise while on the road. Sensor technology has been in development and in use since the 1980s, with the introduction of antilock brakes. Using this technology, Google modified a Toyota Prius with several sensors which allows the car to access a 3-D model of its environment. The proper technology to introduce driverless cars is clearly already available to manufacturers. In fact, in 2013, BMW announced the \"Traffic Jam Assistant,\" which allows the car to steer, accelerate, and brake itself. The world is already well on its way to the creation of a truly driverless car.  Looking at paragraph 4 it states that,\"Google's modified Toyota Prius uses position-estimating sensors on the left rear wheel, a rotating sensor on the roof, a video camera mounted near the rearview mirror, four automative radar sensors, a GPS receiver, and an inertial motion sensor.\" From this quote, you can already see how complex a driverless car needs to be in order to run efficiently. All of these gadgets have to installed and all of them are very necessary. According to the author in paragraph 4, it also claims, \"The most important bit of technology in this system is the spinning sensor on the roof. Dubbed LIDAR, it uses laser beams to form a constantly updating 3-D model of the car's surroundings.\" If the LIDAR malfunctions, then the car has no information on its surroundings. It would be virtually impossible for a driverless car to work without the perfect execution of all these devices. I believe that there is too much room for error.  Sebastian Thrun, founder of the Google Car project, believes that with the technolgy progressing consumers can have a driverless cab take us wherever we would like to go. Along with the sensors the radar will help with the antilock system to make that dream come ture.  BMW has already annouced the development of \"Traffic Jam Assistant\". It's a car the can handle driving up to 25 mph, but touch sensors keeps the driver holding the wheel in case of a malfunction. The human driver must remian alert and be able to take over in certain situations. Manufacturers are also considering using cameras to watch that drivers are remaining focused on the road.  In the article, the author gave examples as to how the cars were given features that'd make them seem driverless. There were, of course, radar features and motion sensors, but at the end of the day the author of the artilce said, \"..None of the cars developed so far are completely driverless.\" Now of course they can still do the things needed to drive i. e. steer, speed up, and break, but there are still special sensors made to make sure that the driver still has their hands on the wheel. The author of the article then says, \"This means the human driver must remain alert and be ready to take over when the situation requires.\"  The Google car for example, has sensors on the left rear wheel, a rotating sensor on the roof, a camera on the rearvier mirror, four automotive radar sensors, a GPS reciever, and an inertial motion sensor. The car runs off of all of these sensors, and needs every single one of them to run properly. But what happens if one of these sensors reade untrue values because they have malfunctioned or got covered up by something. Technology can only go so far into our lives before we are putting human life at risk. All it takes is one failure, one moment where a sensor isn't working correctly , and a persons life could be over. The sensors also cost money. This would make many of these cars almost unbuyable to the general public because of the cost of parts and matenience.  Automated cars require many sensors and cameras that regular cars do not need, and even with these sensors, the cars are not capaple of completely driving themselves. In order to achieve a reliable driverless system, all of our roads would have to have electricity or magnets installed, which even the article admits would be \"too expensive to be practical\". Furthermore, the money spent on developing these cars could be spent to help those who are less fortunate rather than creating new things for ourselves.  Google's cars that can drive independently under specific conditions have \"driven more than half a million miles without a crash.\" The driverless car has not been fully developed, yet already Google's cars have successfully driven over a long distance without any accidents. Technology is constantly improving, and so will safety. Google's cars have position-estimating sensors, automative radar sensors, and even a rotation sensor on the roof. As these senors are improving, it is also making \"driving safer and also leading to cars that can handle more and more driving tasks on their own.\" Once the driverless car is completed, it should have the sensors and technology to keep drivers safe, more than the ability of an actual human drivers to keep themselves safe. The advanced technology is not only a dream, but is slowly becoming a reality. Sebastian Thrun, founder of the Google Car project, \"believes that the technology has finally begun to catch up to the dream.\" The driverless car is a ensured success, and with the development of the driverless car, comes the ensured safety of the driver.

Dr. Huang states \"For example when a web ad appears on your screen and you smile a similar ad may follow, But if you frown the next ad will be different. A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,\" Dr. Huang predicts. This Quote and prediction of Dr. Huang states that is has potential to keep students intrestred into work  The human body has way more than just six emotions so getting a high accuracy reading on how you are really feeling is out of the question because FACS uses the a process of a 3-D model Dr. Huang states \"The process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D model of the face; all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles.\" This quote explains that it has to use a way of making a model which can sometimes take some time depending on the processing power of the computer not only that but human emotions can change quite quickly and if the pc doesnt make the model fast enough the computer can easly fail at getting and accuarate reading.  Dr. Huang is talking about the device using video images to pick up the emotions of each person. Dr. H states \"using video imagery, The new emotion recognition software tracks these facial movments in a real face or on a painted face.\" This quote brings to light that the machine can read emotions but one could say since it is still in new development that not all of the bugs or glitches have been worked out not only that but you also have to devote more resources to keep the machine working which can average to be a heafty hit to your wallet.  When Dr. Huang describes how this system can engage a student he states, \"[the computer] could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored\" and further explains that \"[the system] could modify the lesson\" to acomidate to the students needs (para. 6). In a normal classroom, when the teachers method of teaching is confusing students, the teacher should find a different way of teaching to engage students. The author also explains how the system is able to read six different emotions and can \"identify mixed emotions\" to allow the system to see if their methods are benefitting the student (para. 4). This computer system would be valuable when keeping the students engaged.  In the article, Nick D'Alto used a quote from Dr. Huang which was \"'A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,' Dr. Huang predicts. 'Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor.  In the passage, the article states that a classroom computer could recognize a stuudent becoming confused or bored (Dr. Huang). After that, it could modify the lesson similar to what an effective human instructor could do  Initially, the thought of additional advancement of technology is frightening. Predicting ideas is not always a sure way of indicating what will occur. However, after Dr. Huang introduces and explains his new concept of Facial Action Coding System Technology, it is arduous to reject the placement of this software into everyday life. Hopefully, the program will be installed soon so it can start making improvements in various industries across the board.  For example,\" a classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,\" Dr. huang predicts. \" Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instrucuture.\" This is really helpful to some students because when taking an online lesson some of them might be comfused and the teacher is no there to help. So the computer can take these facial expresions and modify the lesson so you could undestand it better. This also follows along if a student needs help with the lesson, the computer could see you are having a hard time and t to help you by changing the lesson  Dr. Huang also explains that \"the facial expressions for each emotion are universal\" reguardless of the desgree of expression, (D'Alto). Finally, the fear of more computer based activities is rapidly squashed by the contradiction that being more aware should envoke more human interaction, not lesson it.  This can be seen in the text when it says, \" A classroom computer could recognize when a stuent is becoming confused or bored,\" Dr Huang predicts. \"Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor,\"\" (D'Alto 6). This exemplifies that the schools want to use this technology to help students learn more effectively by using technology thats like a teacher. For some students this may cause trouble if they make facial expressions, but it's not about the lesson. Such as if a student is told something by another student and the student looks confused, the computer might see that and think they dont understand the lesson. Then it would modify the lesson for the student even if the student understood it just fine. A teacher would be much better at understanding the students emotions in a certain situation than technology. ",

                "content": "Vauban, an upscale community in Germany, is home to suburban pioneers who have given up their cars. Seventy percent of Vauban's family do not own cars and fifty-seven percent sold a car to move there. \"Smart planning\" is a component of the movement to seperate suburban life from auto use to create a denser and more compact enviornment and let people be more accesssible to public transportation. This means less space for parking, and more stores compactly placed and at short distances. In Bogota, \"Car-free day\" is part of an improvement campaign which helps residents of the city to see how life is life without the use of cars for a day. People use public transportation and walk to their destinations with no problem. More parks and sport centers have also been added to the area as a result of less car usage, so more space for other important things.   few people will be buying gas or diesel fuel for their cars. Elisabeth Rosenthal tells her audience that Vauban, Germany has an upscale community where nearly everyone has given up their cars. Here, people sold their cars just so that they could buy a house in peace without having to hear traffic jams and honking horns all the time. Many say that this environment makes them happier because it is so peaceful. 70% of the community do nott own cars and the ones that do must leave it in a large parking garage outside the developement\u00a0 that is purchased with the home. In another article, also written by Elisabeth Rosenthal, discusses America and the recent\u00a0 decrease of the amount of driven by a single person. Research shows that the amount driven in 1995 is about the same as the amount driven in 2013. This is due to environmental protectionists who walk evrywhere they go and due to the dangers of driving. There are fewer young adults driving today as well; in eight years, the amount has decreased 23%  Some cities are making themselves car-free. Like in Vauban, Germany; Paris; Bogota, Colombia; and even the president of the United States is trying to \"curb the United States' greenhouse gas emissions\" (Rosenthal, Paragraph 29). In Vauban, Germany residents of a community are \"going where few soccer moms or commuting executives have ever gone before: the have given up their cars\" (Rosenthal, Paragraph 1).  The continuing congestion and traffic jams that are among most areas of the world, create an enormous amount of stress for the people driving. Many develop road rage or irritability and are unhappy after suffering from a long ride home because of traffic. Some believe that cities should become more like Vauban, a community in Germany in which the citizens have given up their cars, because those who live there are not focused on driving and are pleased living in such a manner. Heidrun Walter, a mother who lives in Vauban, portrays her love for this car-free community when she states, \"When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way\" (Rosenthal). By living in an area with little or no use of cars, the society becomes more cheerful and has less stress to cope with. In addition, with no cars people are forced to spend more of their time outside to get from one place to another. In Bogota, Colombia there is an annual car-free day, in which anyone who does use their car has to pay a fine. Many spend their day outside walking or riding their bikes to get around and believe that the car-free day is \"a good opportunity to take away stress...\" (Selsky). As they exercise more without cars and enjoy the great outdoors, they wear bright smiles on their faces and look at things with a positive attitude.  In the German suburb of\u00a0 Vauban, citizens have given up their cars. A resident there says \"when i had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way\" (3). Limiting car use also limits the frequency of trafic jams, accidents, and unfriendly drivers in a hurry along with the stress and frustration that accompany them. In Colombia's capital, Bogata, the Day Without Cars has had many participants. One of whom said \"It's a good opportunity to take away stress\" referring to the event. (24) limiting stress can have major benefits to a persons health and mental well-being. limiting the use of cars does'nt just positivly effect mental health, it can positivly influence physical health. In Bogata, Colombia, the car-free day inspired residents to \"hike, bike, skate, or take buses to work \" (20). Excersize releases endorphins which are chemicals in the brain related to pleasure. Many people that excersize regularly are happier then when they don't. By limiting car usage,citizens are more inspired to excersize making them happier and healthier.  People in a samll town of VAUBAN, Germany have already stopped use of cars. People report to be \"Happier without them.\"  In Vauban germany, residents of the town are starting to take efforts in the first of \"car-free\" societies. To most people this idea could seem unpractical, but car free living can be very benefitial, to the enviroment and daily life.  In other societies where limitations of car usage occured, the majority of its denizens replied positively. In the car-depleted suburb of Vauban, Germany, \"57 percent sold a car to move [to Vauban]\" (Source 1). The influential idea of a suburb without traffic jams and long drives to stores attracted 5,500 current residents of Vauban. Futhermore, car bans in Paris reduced emissions and cleansed the air \"after days of near-record pollution\" (Source 2) and \"five-days of intensifying smog\" (Source 2). During this ban, \"congestion was down 60 percent\" (Source 2), relieving traffic and pollution. In Bogota, Colombia, a \"car-free day\" (Source 3) promotes \"alternative transportation and reduce[s] smog\" (Source 3). One Colombian businessman commented cheerfuly, \"It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution.\" (Source 3)  \"All of our development since World War II has been centered on the car, and that will have to change\" (Rosenthal source 1) said Transportation of America official David Goldberg in Elisabeth Rosenthal's article \"In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars.\" With air pollution, smog, and greenhouse gas emissions rising all around the world, officials have announced that cars are to blame. With this, many are resorting to making changes in their communities by offering alternate means of transportation and bringing homes and stores closer together.  In the article \"In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars\", by Elisabeth Rosenthal, the author talks about a car-free town, Vauban, Germany.\u00a0Because there are not cars, people are forced to use other forms of transportation. Instead of using cars, mothers and their children walk everywhere, people ride their bikes to the store, and a tram is used to go to downtown Freiburg. Another place where transportation has benefited from a car-free society, is Bogota, Columbia. According to the article \"Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota\", written by Andrew Selsky, since car-free day began, bicycle and pedestrian-friendly areas have been improved. For example, since the 1990s, 118 miles of bicycle paths have been built in Bogota. \"Parks and sports centers have bloomed throughout the city; uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks; rush-hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic; and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up\", writes Selsky. Promotion of other transportation, such as walking, is just one of many benefits of limiting car usage. ",

Who draws the line that states whether or not you are allowed to vote. We do! Therefore we should be able to decied ourselves who can be our president to the United States of America. It is niot fair that we need to elect others to have our submission be made. Even when we tell our electors who we choose, they might turn arouhd and vote for the other person. In  Source 2 \"The indefensible electorial college : why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong by Bradford Plumer\"  backs up my response when stating,\"In the same vein, 'faithless' electors have ocasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please...\". That to me my friend, is not fair at all.  In doing this you are having a fair vote in the election with everyone who is eligable to vote, voting whomever they please. If you vote for your own president of your choice there will not be any elector deciding for you if they do not like what you have elected. We need to have a say in what we want. I mean if we want someone to be watching over us, and deciding what to do, we want someone who everyine agrees on. Just a few hundred poeoplpe choosing for you is nothing compared to approximatley more than a million people choosing for themselves. In  Source 2 \"The indefensible electorial college : why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong by Bradford Plumer\"  it says that the electors can always defy the will of the people. In my case I believe that no one would want that. I mean, would you want that?  This means an elector with similar beliefs to the citizens will be chosen and most likely decide their vote in consideration of popular demand. Each state is given representatives in proportion to the poulation of the state. These people can be anyone who does not work in office and maybe a regular American who is probably going to emathize with the needs of the public and if chosen correctly will stand by the option of the state. Electoral College gives a more concentrated form of voting.  The author says \"faithless electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please\" (Plumer 11). Going into this further, that means that one person can disagree with hundreds of people's votes for his own vote of the opposite party. Also, if a tie was to occur int the total electoral votes then the outcome would be put into the hands of the House of Representitives. If the people were to vote in the first place this occurance would have never came close.  As is says in source 2, many voters vote for the wrong person. They also don't always get controll over who they vote for. Say they voted for one canidate to be their state senator, well with that one person comes many people that have \"pledged\" themselves to that canidate. They would be voting for the canidate and these many people that have pledged themselves to him and they don't even know it.  Also as they say in source 2, the election of 2000 was a huge mishap in presidential election history. In states like Louisiana, they had people replace democratic electors so that the popular vote that would've went to one of the canidates, didn't actually go through.  By this the number is much smaller since each country is weighed and is worth certain points and decided by electors you choosed to trust to vote for the same president you did. You still are in control just that you choose somebody he/her is not likely to change his or her mind and vote for the exact person you want he or she to vote for. It stated in the article that \"Each candidate running for president in your state has his or her own group of electors. The electors are generally chosen by the candiate's politcal party.\" I say that if the candidate political party chooses the electors then they must be good and the party must be sure the elector won't change his mind out of no where.  \u00a0 In the article,\"Does the Electoral College Work\", it states that becasue of the diffrent sizes of our states some people feel they do not get a fair say in who makes decisions for our country. They feel that because they dont live in a big state like Texas they do not have equal say in the decisions our country makes. In the article Plumer wrote, \" In the same vein, faithless electors have pccasionally refused to vote for their party's canidate and cast a deciding vote for whoever they please...\". The Electoral College is changing peoples mind set on how to vote because they feel why should we care if the government does not, can you blame them? If we just took out the simple problem of the Electoral College more voters will vote honestly rather then go with everyone elses vote.  The canidates would have to campaign in every state rather than just the \"swing\" states which are people that have not yet decided which way they wanted to vote. the cenidates dont campaign in a state if they know that they have no chance of winning the electoral votes in that state. During the 2000 election a remarkable seventeen states did not see the campaign one time nor did the people in the 25 largest media markets see a campaign ad whether it be on t. v., in the newspaper, or over the radio. If the president was elected by popular vote than every state would be considered a swing state.  If one wanted to, an elector can completely disregard the decision of the voters and choose who they want. Considering the ratio of electors in some states to people, it seems completely non-democratic for the votes of some to be more important than the wants of the common people. Some start to feel that they shouldn't vote because their one vote wouldn't have the power to change anything, and wouldn't even ensure the election of the president they want. Another thing that lowers the morale is the absence of candidates in states that can't be won very easily. If a candidate is pretty sure he can't win over a state, he won't visit it because it wouldn't be worth his time. He also wil prioritize large states over small ones because they have more electoral votes. All of these can make a state or person feel as if the election isn't really in their hands, and when people feel like their vote doesn't matter, they don't vote.  According to Source 2, \"state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors, and... those electors could always defy the will of the people.\" The defenders could be completely indifferent about the voters choices, or situations where swing states are borderline one party or another, and the Electoral College allows a limited selelction of people to make the final decision of millions (Source 1). The ballots that we vote in don't even effect the results of the election. It is as if these elections are trying to illude citizens from the fact that the only votes that contribute to the adoption of a new president are the electoral votes. Why bother letting us vote for a president, if only the defenders get to make the decisions? ",

                "content": "To conclude students are better off taking classes at school, but there is a small population of students that taking online classes could work better for. Students would have to test out the options first and see what works best. Because even though online school sounds good on paper, it could very well be horrid in practice. Students always want to find the easy way out, and online school could be that no challenge road. That would lead to a greater number of students failing out of rigorous courses, and a potential of uneducated students because of a lower retention of material. Overall students should stay in school because it would create the fun challenging environment and a better social understanding for students.  In conclusion, while many think that taking online school would have students lack social skills for their future job, online school would have a positive impact for students who need to help out more at home and for students that physically attending school would prevent them from their full potential. Unfortunately, attending school is not the best option for some students, and having the choice of online school should definitely be provided to students who would greatly benefit from it.   \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0   \u00a0  Online schooling would certainly work best for some students, but it would be more detrimental for the learning of others due to the diversity in the ways in which we learn.   One of the many reasons online school would be beneficial is because it makes it easier for students who might have social issues and have a hard time participating in class activities  Online schooling and courses is just not the way to gain a proper education and it does more damage than anything else. Because people need other people taking them out of the class room for even one year for online schooling can have devastating impacts on the student and it may take years to reverse the damage. Risking vital aspects of success like the development of social skills and the brain is just not worth the easy courses of online schooling and should never be implemented into school systems. It sets you up to be steps be hide\u00a0your peers meaning you'll always have to play catch up. In the end online schooling isn't worth the all the struggles you'll have to face as an adult and in college and its my strong recommendation that you stay away from it.  In America today many students are now doing online schooling. These students do school on their computers which requires an obtuse amount of reading. Students do their work online while often times attending video conferences. A handful of parents believe getting an education online is not giving their children what they need to get a full education. They believe there is nothing to gain from online school that you won't get from public school. But many disagree with that sentiment. Is public school really ultimately the best option for students?  In conclusion, online school for students could be greatly\u00a0beneficial. Through one on one interaction with teachers, spurring more inquiries from pupils, becoming more proficient with technology at school and in the workplace, and allowing students who are afflicted with disease, and sometimes an injury, to attend school. Online school would benefit many students in this modern world. Now do what you think is right, go to a school board meeting, or sign a petition, because once we make this change, the Virginian education system will be stronger than any other state's. Now that isn't able to be said every day.  Despite what one may believe when it comes to school, it is essential for anyone to have the\u00a0opportunity to attend online school from home. Being in the familiarity and comfort of your own home causes beneficial aspects to ones life. It allows them to become more efficient, along with other skills needed to be successful. Prevention of any sort of conflict is important and needed to help whoever is having an issue. Online school is the new frontier, and to many, has already done its justice. Online school should be seen as the next best thing for any person who wishes to pursue their knowledge. It is time to get past the old-fashioned ideologies that learning should be done in a classroom, we are past that age and are continuing\u00a0on into a new one.   \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  Students aren't all the same, and having one technique used on all can hinder some of their abilities. Students taking online classes could use outside resources for study and this could create the situation best suited for their learning style. This could lead to better retention of the knowledge and a greater understanding of the material. Students could take the course at their speed, this could mean some would finish faster than others, but the main argument in this is students would have better material retention because they would be in the mindset of learning and not just going through the motions of school. Online school has its niche benefits for its population of students willing to take the toll.   Some are just naturally shy and others just simply do not like working with others. For this reason, attending online classes at home is a great alternative for these students who are not socially comfortable. This way, students can complete projects on their own at home and they can stay focused on their tasks without the awkward feeling of having to worry about others at public school. Another strong quality of attending and completing an online course is that many online courses have fun and interactive lessons that keep a student engaged in the lesson, rather than sitting in a classroom and doing nothing because they are bored of the teaching or they are once again, just\u00a0uncomfortable socially in a public setting. One on one online video conferencing is also easier for students to talk to their teachers if they need help because they may feel uneasy when speaking to a teacher or others in person. As a result, they also can learn things in an online course that they may not have ever learned if they were taking that certain course in a public school setting. ",

They vote for who they believe would lead our society and modern day world in the right direction. They would like to think that one vote could make a difference in a election, but with the Electoral College voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference rather than vote who they actulally want to be president.  By , not making their vote count some people can feel that their voices are not being heard which can lead to in some cases riots and rebellions etc. Voting happens for a reason if gives the world a chance to pick whom they want to see lead them and who they feel like is the right person but in the end if there votes cant count and actually go to the electors limits their power and freedom to speak. '' Voters in presidential elections ae people who want to express a political prefeence rather than people ho think that a single vote may decide an election''.(source 3 , p.23). The Electoral College may have worked in the past but now its not working as well.  If someone were to ask one hundred different people what their favorite food is, they would probably get 100 different answers. This can be applied to advice because, if someone were to ask several different people for advice, they could get completely different advice from different people, and, chances are, some of the advice can really help instead of giving the person that needs advice useless information floating around. For a moment, imagine that it's time to vote for the President, and person 1 has no idea of who to vote for.  So person one goes back to his/her good friend person 2, then asks, \"Person two, who are you voting for?\" Person two replies with his/her chosen candidate, and person one asks several other people, and finally, person four tells person one about the candidate that he/she has chosen, and person one also votes for that person, because from what person four said, that person will do great things as President. If person one had just asked person two who to vote for, he/she never would've known that person four had chosen the candidate that was right for person one's beliefs. Another benefit to getting multiple people's solutions is that the different advice can be applied to the same problem until something works. For example, person one is trying to fix that pesky flat tire on his/her car, and then the advice that person two and person three gave. Because person one can't get person four to help, because person four is on vacation in Norway, person one decides to apply the advice of person two and person three to see if something works, and it turns out that person two had good advice once person one figured out what person two was trying to say. Basically, multiple answers can lead to the best answer and many solutions can be applied to the same problem until something works.  Candidates mostly pay attention to states that have more electoral votes, this causes them to pay more attention to the bigger states and leave out the smaller ones, as already argued, some states get more electoral votes than others. Another reason why this is bad is because most states will not pay attention in the election because they will not make a difference. If popular vote were to be in action, then more people and citizens will pay attention because it will be a more interesting election since more epeople have a say and the candidates will pay attention to all states. Even the bigger states with more electoral votes know that they are the ones to basically decide the election.  This reason is because of their winner takes all system in each state, candidates don't spend time in the states they feel they have no chance of winning. They only focus on the  \"swing\" states , the states they feel they have a chance in or feel they have to win over. During the 2000 campaign , seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all and the largest media didn't get to see a single\u00a0 campaign ad. Candidates only visit states they feel are important to them which is considered unfair to the voters who actually vote for them.  The second reason as to why I am not in the favor of the Electoral College process is because as said in source #3, \" Voter is toss-up states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign- to really listen to the competing candidates- knowing that they are going to decide the election\"  because candidates don't spent time in the states they know they will lose in. They only foucus on the states that they know they will win in or of a close chance to the other candidate, because of this there has been times when people would not see the candidates at all or they did'nt get to see a single campaign ad. If there was popular vote then this would not be the case and it would be eliminated, because candidates would have no choice but to put up advertisments all over the country.  But some people don't really know what they are voting for in election which is why the Electoral College is the way to go. Also people complained with the \"winners take all method\" some candidates don't go to certain states and only focus on the swing states. In the 2000 campaign seventeen out of fifty states didn't see the candidates. But the candidates didn't go to those states since they knew they had no chance of winning those states and they needed to focus on the swing states to make sure they win the election. Many people do call the Electoral College an anachronism, but it doesn't need to stick in the past, it needs to be kept in the present and in the future.  When you go to vote, you don't actually vote for the candidate, you vote for a group of people who in turn vote for the candidate. I find this to be ineffective, because the people you are voting for are still able to switch there vote to the other party,  Because of the \"winner-take-all system in each state\", the candidates don't take time to go to other states that they know they will lose, they only really focus on the \"swing\" states. For example, during the 2000 campaign, seventeen statesdidn't see the candidates in their state at all, also 25 of the largest media markets had not seen a single campaign ad from a candidate. Also it's unfair because voters don't really know who to vote for because they see no campaign ads and candidates don't show up to their state and tell them what he/she is running for. That's why the Electoral College is unfair to voters of the presidential election. ",

If you vote for your own president of your choice there will not be any elector deciding for you if they do not like what you have elected. We need to have a say in what we want. I mean if we want someone to be watching over us, and deciding what to do, we want someone who everyine agrees on. Just a few hundred poeoplpe choosing for you is nothing compared to approximatley more than a million people choosing for themselves. In  Source 2 \"The indefensible electorial college : why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong by Bradford Plumer\"  it says that the electors can always defy the will of the people. In my case I believe that no one would want that. I mean, would you want that?  Eeveryone should have a say in what goes on where ever it is that they live. We the people make up the government. Who draws the line that states whether or not you are allowed to vote. We do! Therefore we should be able to decied ourselves who can be our president to the United States of America. It is niot fair that we need to elect others to have our submission be made. Even when we tell our electors who we choose, they might turn arouhd and vote for the other person. In  Source 2 \"The indefensible electorial college : why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong by Bradford Plumer\"  backs up my response when stating,\"In the same vein, 'faithless' electors have ocasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please...\". That to me my friend, is not fair at all.  In the article  What Is The Electoral College by the office of the Federal Register, it states that the election process is held every four years along with the after election prepared by the govenor titled \"Certificate Of Ascertainment\" which sums the canadidates and electors as well as the winning canadidate. It is obvious that the voters only know so much of what they vote for and do not really get a good taste of how the presidential canadidate is like. It can be clear that as a blind election, the voters have no hints of who they might be voting towards and in the end can cause a major catasrophe if a canadidate has very little intentions for the states. In agreement to the article the text  In the defense of the electoral college by Richard A. Posner it begins to sate the election of Romney who, by increasing his plurality and possesing only regional appeal, lost the peoples desire to vote for him thinking that the man has no regards for their interest and does not have any intentions of improving their needs or helping with creating a community where the people can rely on Romney. The actions taken began to change the thoughts of the citizens and create a petrifying conclusion that the man was not on the run to be everyone's president. This dilema could have been changed around if Romney had shown that he had cared more for his state and his country and thought more about the needs he could fill and the actions he could improve, then many of the voters would have most likely shown repsect and a desire for the man to be choosen as their new president. On the opposing hand Romney had not shown any of those qualities or passion which had caused for him to be thought of as unresponisble and selfish.  The country has more than thousands and thousands of people to serve and direct. It can be understood that having a large amount of citizens can result in uncertainty towards the election and the votes cast, yet it is yet to be changed to a more reasonable way of confronting it. With many systems such as \"Winner-Take -All\" due to states titled as the \"Swing States,\" it can be an untrustworthy election fo rmany voters around the country. The election process not only need to be changed to select a more responsible canadidate, but to create a more trustworthy system of itself.   The Electoral College is unfair, unjust, and unamerican. The system takes away our right to vote for who we want not who we want to vote for us. If you are a true American you will understand why I know this is flawed. The Electoral College is not a proper way to handle our votes it must be a vote decided completely by the people of Amercia.     Allowing the people to vote for whoever they want to is not a good idea. It can lead to bigger problems and issues. Voting for yourself can be very, very stressful. Adding on top of more strees. Of course its easier this way but your electing who is going to be the \"President\". Someone who controlls your country, tells YOU what to do, and makes new laws. It shouldn't be as easy as writting on a piece of paper who you want to be president. There should be some type of way to make it alittle more precise. This is why there is the Electoral College. All you have to do is get with someone you trust and vote for them to be apart of the canidates electors. Then all they have to do is vote for who they want to be president and see what happens. Its just as easy as what we have now but alittle bit more neat/clean. I Know I am spilling alot of information onto you about the \"EC\". And the advantages and disadvantages of having it. But I ask you to read this letter and think about what role YOU play in this election.  For my conclusion this proves that there are many difficulties along the way of an election, regarding the votes and voters. With this letter being written, people should not wonder whether or not the electoral college should be abolished, and go with the popluar voting method. You shouldn't be thinking about just a couple of people, but of a whole nation and deciding who is worthy enough in our eyes to lead us to more victories with the popular voting method.     Sometimes voters could be discombabulated about who it is they are voting for. Sometimes voters can't control who the electors vote for. This is both confusing and frustrating for anyone who thinks they voted for someone great, but the electors change that. In \"Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong,\" it says that \"Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president.\", meaning that we don't choose for ourselves, they do.  As stated in \"What Is the Electoral College?\", \"... when you vote for your candidate you are acually voting for your candidate's electors.\" (Office of the Federal Register).\u00a0 This means, voters have no control over whom controls the country.\u00a0 That is outrageous that the lives of these people will be affected by someone they did not want in the overpowering decisions of their country. Writer Plumer states, \"At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair too voters\" as well as \"The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational\" (Plumer).\u00a0 Both of these point go to show that the electoral college is lowering our hopes for the government.\u00a0 The writer also notes, \"candidates don't spend time in states they have no chance in winning, focusing only on the tight races in the \"swing\" states\" (Plumer).\u00a0 This proves that the electoral government thinks about their winning chances instead of our countries government.\u00a0 Are we going to sit here and let them take advantage of their power that will lead us towards disaster?  See if we had a vote to see if we should have to electoral college i think alot of people would vote no. I dont see why we cant have this vote as a country then there wouldnt be a topic to argue about. The electoral college is a decision that was not in the constitution i believe so it can be removed very easily. My opinion is that we take the electoral college out because it is causing nothing but arguing. We deserve to pick if we want to have a president we want or not. We deserve this power atleast, we dont have any power as regular people we deserve this. They shouldnt have the right to take this away from us  Electoral College believers think that having electors go on either side to let one canidate win, is right. \"Knowing their vote will have no effect, they have less incentive to pay attention to the campaign than they would have if the president were picked by popular vote..\"(Posner). So these Electoral College followers agree with the electors actually selecting the winner because they don't have to do anything. People can just sit back and watch the electors take the power, while the others do nothing but be slumps. In source one, the Office of the Federal Register mention that \"when you vote for your candidate you are actually voting for your candidate's electors.\", which means that if voters have friends in the position of an elector, voters might just vote for the elector because theres nothing else to really pay attention to.

In doing this, students may be prepared for the upcoming year when they return to school from break. Many people believe that summer projects should be teacher-designed while others believe that they should be student-designed.  Summer projects are something that some schools require students to complete. They are given so students may continue to learn, even during their summer break. However, there is a debate whether summer projects should be teacher-designed or student-designed.  Teacher-designed projects are the best way for schools to ensure that students continue learning material for classes during break without causing anxiety in students or misjudgment of students by teachers. Summer projects are meant to help students but student-designed projects can sometimes harm students instead. Every student should be allowed to spend their summer without stressing about how they will be perceived by their fellow classmates and teachers the next year. Summer projects should encourage students to continue to learning while also spending quality time with their family and friends during their break.  Most schools require students to complete a variety of projects during their summer break like reading books or completing a math packet. These projects help students continue their learning away from school, except the only difference is that they have all of summer to do it compared to having a due date within a week. Some projects prepare students for the upcoming school year while others act like reminders so that students won't forget what they learned in the past year. Though some believe that summer projects should be student-designed, others will argue that summer projects should be teacher-designed in order to get the best learning experience while away from school.  Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break, but are unsure whether these tasks should be student-designed or teacher-designed. Psychologists have proven that in order for a person to actually remember information, that information needs to be repeatedly tested upon in order to remain significant in the brain. Summer break, as a huge gap in between\u00a0learning periods, is massively disruptive to the cognitive process  Some schools assign students summer projects to assure they continue to learn during their vacation. These projects should be designed by the students. The projects should be student-designed because teachers have high standards. Due to these high standards their projects require students to push themselves when all year that what they've been doing. Lack of interest plays a huge role in many teacher's projects. Teachers aren't doing their best to assure that their projects spark some aspect of interest in their students. Having no interest in a project can cause the student to procrastinate and not do their best. Lastly, students have complicated schedules in the summer, many go away on vacation or spend time with family. Having a teacher designed-project that's time consuming can take away from their valuable time. Letting students design the project can ensure they will have enough time to work on it and will encourage them to finish it earlier. Student-designed projects can benefit the student immensely in multiple ways, where as a teacher-designed project will let them down and cause unnecessary\u00a0stress.  Have you ever ever been required to do a summer project that your not intreasted in? Certain schools in America require students to complete summer projects to ensure they are still learning over break. Students are often assined teacher designed projects. While most students complete these over summer projects many students don't due to lack of intrest in the assined topic.  Summer projects have long been a popular way to ensure that students continue learning during their break. Ranging across subjects, summer assignments encompass everything from math packets to reading lists to art projects. These assignments can be either teacher- or student-designed -- two different styles of learning, but both with the goal of preparing for the upcoming year. Teacher-designed projects often focus on important information for the class and student-designed projects often focus on exploring their interests.  Summer is a great way to take a break from school, but also to apply knowledge to the real world. In some areas, students are required to complete summer projects to ensure they continue to learn over their break. These projects are usually designed by the teachers, who want their students to be as prepared as possible for what they will learn in the fall. However, some argue that summer projects should be designed by students, as they can create engaging ways to educate themselves. This can better prepare students for the ways they will apply what they learned in school in the real world.  If a school assigns a summer project to their students, the project should be student designed. there re many different ways to continue learning when formal school is on a break, but a student designed project will allow for creativity, flexibility, and be better for teachers as well as students. Above all, schools should focus on educating students in a way that allows them creating and ensure that they are passionate about what they learn, if not students will never develop a life long love of education.

                "content": "This can greatly change a students grades from bad to good, along with make them look forward to coming to your class or school in general. From paragraph 6 the author stated, \"A classroom computer could recongnize when a student is becoming confused or bored.\" Ending the conversation with, \"Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instuctor.\" Another point which dosn't relate to the fact of changing around lessons for a student would be also in paragraph 6,\"...if you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be different.\" This technology can overall make a students lesson, web browsing, and understanding of materal a lot easier and it could greatly improve their work.  Dr. Huang is talking about how it can change the ads you see and veiw if you dont look happy when you look at them. Dr. Huang states \"For example when a web ad appears on your screen and you smile a similar ad may follow, But if you frown the next ad will be different. A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,\" Dr. Huang predicts. This Quote and prediction of Dr. Huang states that is has potential to keep students intrestred into work  like its says in paragraph 6 \"Imagine a computer that knows when you're happy or sad\". For example if you smile when a web ad appears on your screen a similar ad might follow. But if you frown the next ad will be different \"A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored \"Most human communication is nonverbal including emotional communication\" noted Dr. Huang \"So computers need to understand that too  The information gathered from students could be used for selfish purposes, as explained in the sixth passage of the article, \"if you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be different,\" showing that companies have use for this technology to better their businesses. If ad companies managed to get this emotional information from students all across the country, either from the government itself or through illegal actions, they could use that information to make new products and ads that would try to exploit the emotions of children. Because of this and the added concern of giving the information to the government itself, many parents would oppose a system that tracks and records the emotions of children.  If implemented in daily computers, this technology will revolutionize the environemnt and usage of the Internet. Because this technology can map emotions, \"if you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be different\" (6). With the implementation of this technology, students will be able to influence which advertisements and pages appear on their screen. This will reduce their impatience on the computer, and actually stay focused on the task at hand, rather than getting frustrated and walking away.  Electronics as of now are programmed to teach a student however are unable to sense how the student is feeling or how they are actually doing on their assignment. As the author states in the article, \"most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication\" something which computers are unable to detect (para. 6). Not only this, but the author gives an analogy that states \"if you smile when a web ad appears on your screen, a smilar ad might follow\" and explains that in a classroom, similar techniques can be applied to benefit the student (para. 6). Using this program will allow technology to advance and in turn will benefit the student.  In the sixth paragraph of the article \"Making Mona Lisa Smile,\" the author illuminates the possibilites of success human-emotion-recognizing computer software provides in terms the world of marketing, describing how analyzing the emotional response to a Web ad popping up on one's computer screen can mold the variety of its future ads to a more preferred selection (6).  Nick D' Alto says \"Imagine a computer that knows when you're happy or sad.\" The author of this article talks of how it will improve ad placements by whether you smile or frown, however I know for a fact social medias, especially Facebook, are already basing information on preferable ads by just what material you look at. Why is it necessary for a program to constantly scan our face just to see if we like something or not? This gives the computer so much power of constantly knowing what your exact emotions are on everything. It is just so unnecessary that it causes one to question why in the world would we risk giving computers that kind of power. Also, is it appropiate to constantly scan childrens' faces as they are trying to learn? Would there be a security system in place or parental agreement necessary that would allow the permission of constant invasion of privacy in the name of education? There are many ethical questions and unknown future outlooks that one would not want to subject children to that sort of test of safety and security.  The article states that the technology associates each emotion with \"characteristic movements of the facial muscles\" and then uses those movements to calculate the spectrum of emotions based on their facial display. But some people show emotions in various ways, and the technology most likely cannot accomodate for the many different ways people express the same emotion. For example, if a student has a resting face that seems generally happy, the system might confuse this dazed face as a satisfied face and think that the student is happy with their lessons when they are actually confused or not paying attention. In the same way, if a student has a resting face that looks naturally sad, the system may think they are unhappy with their lessons, even if the student feels they are learning a lot. A lot of students also try to hide their emotions, like frusteration or sadness, with a happier look on their face, and even though the article states that the system can detect a \"false smile\", it cannot always be accurate as a person may be good at hiding their emotions and displaying a genuine smile. Therefore, since technology is not always accurate and because human beings are so various in the way they behave, the technology would not be useful in a classroom where it may misread a student's state of mind and lead them in the wrong path of education.  In the passage \" Making Mona Lisa Smile\" the author states in paragraph 6 line 6,\"A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,\"Dr Huang predicts.\"then it could modify the lesson like an effective human instructor.\",this kind of technology can possibly boost testing score and even help children falling behind instead of holding them back another year. The text also states in paragraph 6 line 10 that ;\"Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communcation,\"notes Dr. Huang.\". This example actually explains alot of real world issues in the classroom, such as the fact that some students refuse to even try to communicate their confusion or boredom in the classroom so then they often disengage in the lesson and miss every part that would be essential to reaching standards created by the state.

                "content": "According to the article \"Making Mona Lisa Smile,\" there is a new technology called the Facial Action Coding System (FACS) that enables computers to identify human emotions. This technology is relatively brand new. It creates a 3-D computer model of all fourty-four major muscles in the face that move like human muscles as well. Then, psychologists have classified six basic emotions that are associated with different movements in the facial mucles. This new technology could result in many benefits in our community as well as all around the world  The highly inteliigent Facial Action Coding System a valuable asset for students in a classroom, as it fosters an enjoyable and captivating learning environment that will shape the students' commitment to school. This advanced software analyzes the movement of a human's facial muscles, comparing it to an emotionless one, and determines the percent distribution their feelings. This innovative software provides students with the ability to customize the pages and lessons on the computer, giving them control over their method of learning. Students with this ability will feel captivated by their learning, as they are in control and can decide how they learn. The development of a desire to learn is crucial for school-aged children so that in the future, they will continue on to further educate themselves and expand their knowledge. This facial  -analysis technology provides schools with the ability to create a captivating learning environment for students that will motivate them to stay committed to their education and reach their goals. While this new technology provides a bounty of benefits to many, assisting students in the achievement of their hopes and dreams holds the most value.  Slip into a world where emotions are easily read. There could be no mind games, no pettiness, and no suffering in silence;this could be the new reality. In the article \"Making Mona Lisa Smile\" by Nick D'Alto, he introduces a new concept created by Thomas Haung:Facial Action Coding System software. This programming system allows computers to register all of the emotions on an individual's face, reguardless if they are mixed.  The Facial Action Coding System enables computers to identify human emotions. This new software has a promising applications for a variety of industries. \"Can we actually calculate emotions, like math homework?\" \"How can a computer recognize the subtle facial movements we humans use to express how we feel?\"  Initially, the thought of additional advancement of technology is frightening. Predicting ideas is not always a sure way of indicating what will occur. However, after Dr. Huang introduces and explains his new concept of Facial Action Coding System Technology, it is arduous to reject the placement of this software into everyday life. Hopefully, the program will be installed soon so it can start making improvements in various industries across the board.  Educators have a very important job. They are building the future for society, which can be very hard. Teachers have to deal with many students, and every student is different. With the use of the Facial Action Coding System, teachers don't have to worry about a teaching method that will not work with all students. In the article \"Making Mona Lisa Smile\" by Nick D'Alto it says that the system recognizes if a student is confused, and alters the lesson to better fit the student. This allows educators to not worry about finding a teaching method that suites every student. This technology also helps out educators, because it works one on one with students. It's made to help every student individually by reading the student's facial expressions. As student's learning patterns may change, the system changes with the student. The use of this technology will also be helpful for teachers because educators can take a look and see what teaching methods work the best with students overall. In the article it says the system can detect when students are confused and bored, so educators can use this technology to see what doesn't make students feel confused nor bored. This technology could be very valuable and helpful for educators.  Students may also use this feature in art classes to really capture what the artist was depicting in the work. For instance, this new software was able to create percentages of Mona Lisa's emotions. The latest innovation in computer software may be very useful for art classes, knowing how a person may be feeling in a painting may help students to depict the artists work, a bit better. As humans, we can tell how someone may be feeling by the look on their face, or the look in their eyes. Most of us would have trouble trying to describe what facial expressions convey being happy, besides a smile. The computer can make exact percentages on each emotion you may be feeling.  New software has been created to determine the facial expressions of students. It uses technology to give data as to what emotions someone is feeling such as happiness, sadness, and boredom. These technologies are possibly going to be used in classrooms to help students learn better based on their emotions towards the lesson that they are learning.  Every living thing on planet earth has emotions. These emotions have been used since the beginning of time to express the feelings of the people around you. However, these emotions can be decieving. Someone could say they are happy, when really they are angry or upset. This is where the Facial Action Coding System comes into play. The FACS is a software that detects human emotion by tracking muscles in the face. For example, when you are happy, muscles in your face move up, and when you are sad, they move down, FACS tracks this and calculates your emotions. The creators of this software, Prof. Thomas Huang and Prof. Nicu Sebe are the leading experts of developing better ways for humans and computers to communicate. There are still some questions surrounding the usefulness of FACS, like what could this software actually be used for? One of the ways FACS may be used is in classrooms.  New technology is being introduced to mankind almost every second in this world, and now, the latest techonology is a computer program called the Facial Action Coding System which can identify a person's emotions. The question is whether this technology is actually valuable and for what it could be used for. Experts suggest this technology could be used in a classroom to identify the state of mind of a student to adjust the lesson they are trying to comprehend. But, even though this technology may be helpful to teachers trying to keep students active and engrossed in their lessons, the question arises of whether this techonlogy is actually worth the recources or whether what experts think is a great idea is actually an invasion of privacy.

While it is true that several conditions on Venus' surface are inhospitable and unable to support or sustain human life, the author claims that \"astronomers are fascniated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system,\" (para 4). This might lead to discoveries that could help us understand or predict Earth's future evolution patterns.  Paragraph 4 states, \"Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system. Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth\" (The Challenge of Exploring Venus). If Venus could've supported human life long ago, it is likely the planet still can. The scientific facts throughout this statement support the author's claim by having a reliable source of information, supporting the idea. Paragraph 4 reads, \"Today, Venus still has some features that are analogous to those on Earth. The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters\" (The Challenge of Exploring Venus). Venus already has Earth-like landscapes and other similar formations. This supports the author's idea of exploring Venus because it is so similar to Earth, the chances of survival are higher than any other planet.  He states that Venus is often referred to as Earth's \"twin\". This is because Venus and Earth are close in size, density, and at some points in orbit are the closest planets in the solar system. It is also believed that at one point, Venus was a lot like Earth is now. \"The Challenge of Exploring Venus\" states, \"Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our soloar system.\". The article goes on to say Venus most likely had large oceans that supported life, and the planet has things like craters, valleys, and mountains that we also have here on Earth. The author including these details helps get the point across that Venus is a lot like Earth, and with the little research been done already, we've found so much. This helps readers understand that the longer Venus is studied, the more we will learn about it.  In article it says,\" Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it way well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system. Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth.  In coclusion, the authors final claim states, \"Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation.\" Although there are many dangers that could seek upon them, they take them as \"challenges\" and are willing to dig deeper to find out why Venus is the way it is. \"Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth- like planet in our solar system.\" Therefore, this is why the author does a good job by suggesting that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents.     This reason of his is,\"It may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system\" (Paragraph 4). The problem with this is that it does not go very deep into why it being similar to Earth matters. A scientist at NASA might understand any signifigance in that statement, but an average person might not. For that reason it is a very weak argument.  According to the article, astronomers are interested in Venus because it was likely the most Earth-like planet in the solar system at one point.  After laying out the dangers of studying Venus, the author explains why scientists continue to study the planet. \"Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system\" (4). By studying Venus, astronomers and geologists can predict what might happen to Earth in the future. Gaining an understanding of Earth's future may well allow scientists to predict what happened in Earth's past. Scientists are eager to learn about the early years of Earth's past, as it is shrouded in mystery, and this thirst for knowledge motivates them to study Venus. In describing how similar Venus was to Earth, the author says, \"Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life\" (4). If there was once life on Venus, the similarity between it and Earth would grow. As with geology, if biologists can understand what caused life to cease on Venus, they might be able to predict how life on Venus and on Earth might have started. The author shows that scientists studying Venus reap the reward of being able to learn about Earth's geology and early life. By laying out the various rewards to be had from studying Venus, the author is strengthening his or her argument that Venus should be studied.  The Earth comes right after Venus in the solar system, making it fairly close given the long time frame of space travel. Astronomers have discovered that it was also previoulsly one of the \"most Earth-like [planets]\" as it \"was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life\" (Paragraph 4). Venus also \"has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters\" (Paragraph 4). In the event that Venus became a viable option for humans to inhabit when Earth collapses (as mentioned earlier), humans would have already been exposed to some of the landscape there. Although this would make Venus more assimilable, its similarity to Earth does not outweigh the dangers that still come with the planet being an unknown land changing from its previous state. With this evidence the author provides an advantage to exploring Venus, but it does not hold up against the established points about Venus' overall uninhabitability. ",

So naturally if someone tells them that they absolutely must do something, they automatically think no way. If they have an attitude like this it will ruin the experience and they won't get the good feeling people do when you serve others. They might dislike it so much that they don't even do service when they're grown up. They resent people that tell them they have to do something, and then they are ornery towards everyone else afterwards.  The feeling you get when you see these people's faces are priceless. It's amazing how contagious a smile is. You can not get that feeling of accomplishment... or that feeling that you actually made someone's day that much better any other way other than performing community service. Yes, it sounds like a pain. I do not know any other way to say it other than to BELIEVE ME when i say that knowing that you helped our community in a positive way is one of the greatest things ever.  When receiving advice, the response you get will be different from everyone. This is because everyone views things from a different standpoint. Some people think it's best to keep their not so positive opinions to themselves, while other are going to share everything with you. It's important to have both these kinds of people in your life, because they're both needed in different situations. Let's say, for instance, you get a new shirt that you absolutely love. You probably want to hear from your peers that it looks great on you. Now, let's say you are shopping and find shoes that you aren't too sure about. In this situation, you're probably wanting to hear from your more honest friend, who will truthfully tell you how they look  If you are making a hard choice, it is important to feel good about what you decide. Knowing that other people agree with you and having a lot of feedback will make you more comfortable with your choice. It can also be less stressful if you know that others believe you are doing the right thing. Many people greatly care about what others think so it can be a relief if they are helped and supported in making a good choice.  It could be that they want to see what other's would do in a certain situation or, just want help and they know that whoever they are asking has been in the same situation before and know how to help or have a suggestion for you to try out. And most people rely on second opinion's because they rule out any other options. For example, if you are debating on buying something that you want, you look at the rating's to see if other people liked it. This counts as an opinion. Or you look at the comment's section to see if it's actually what you want and if people think it's worth it. Getting a second opinion helps in everyday life. People are alway's asking for second opinion's without even realizing it. You do it all the time by asking if your hair looks good or, if they like what your wearing today. It's just a mindless thing we do. We even do it in our head we think about what people would say and we ask them what they think. It's just something everyone does all the time because it's a self conscious thing we all do.  Well not everyone you ask could have the right information, some could be telling false or just bad information. So getting other opinions could come in big for you if the first opinion was not very good. For example if you are trying to get a opinion on what you should buy a family member for a gift and you only get one opinion and they say that the person likes something but they really don't then that could be pretty bad for you. I don't think you would be to pleased either if that happened so just get a second opinion so everyone can be happy. Also sometimes the opinion could just be really bad and not help you at all. So do your self a favor and get multiple opinions.   For example when i needed help with a deciding if i should still be friends with some people. I asked my dad and my siblings for advice, my dad told me that if they dont make me feel good then I should not be friends with them. On the other hand my siblings told me that I should be friends with them because they said that I had so much fun with them and good times. Then I had to make a decision, and it was a tough decision but I ended up still being friends with them, the reason i stayed friends with them was because we had very good times and I did not want that to end. So me and my friends apologized\u00a0to each other\u00a0and we became friends again.  If somebody asked only one person their opinion, it would be impossible to get a group's majority. As mentioned in the second paragraph, a majority of people can bring far more reassurance than one person. This can help somebody make better decisions, since there are other people that have examined the situation as their own, and have given thought out advice. As well, it is often a good feeling to somebody, knowing that multiple people acknowledge and care about them. People like when they have not been lied to, because it shows a relationship of trust. Trust can play a big factor, in terms of advice, because a person will not be able to believe other people's ideas, if they can't rely on the person. In conclusion, asking a group of people for advice can lead to different recommendations, an increased sense of relief, and ultimately, making better decisions. At the end of the day, it is important to ask others for advice because people have to make their own decisions. Sometimes it can be extremely hard for people to decide which path to take.  They might have a different perspective on what you think you should do, or what someone else thinks you should do, because we all think differently. Understanding where people are coming from, even if you disagree can also help you come up with one executive decision. For example, there could be an occasion where you want these nice shoes , but you don't have enough money so you go and ask for people's advice on what you should do. One person says, ask a family member for the money. You ask another person, they say steal the shoes from the store. In this scenario it allows you to think and understand what both people are trying to say and the benefits of each and then you can come down to which is a better choice. Stealing shoes from the store could get you in a lot of trouble, So the clear choice is to ask a family member.  People feel differently about lots of different things, whether they are small issues like shoes being ugly, or big issues like political opinions and whether schools should have dress code. What if someone wants to buy a Cadillac. Obviously, Cadillacs\u00a0are expensive and the person would ask somebody before spending their hard earned money on a Cadillac. If the person asks their best friend who thinks they are ugly if they should get a Cadillac, they would obviously say no. The best friend has an opinion on Cadillacs. If the person had asked somebody who thinks Cadillacs are amazing, they would say to buy it. This is an example of why asking multiple people before making a choice is good because they might have different opinions. If someone wants to open a donut\u00a0shop, but their uncle hates donuts. When they ask their uncle if they should open a donut shop, he will say no. He has an opinion of thinking donuts taste gross. But when they ask their sister who loves all desserts and will always support her sibling. She will say yes because she has an opinion of loving sweet foods and her siblings. This is an example of why people should ask more than one person before they do something. The student president might want to start a book club. A lot of students a do not like books because their teacher made them read a boring book three years ago and they have not liked books since then, they have an opinion on books from a long time ago. The teachers, on the other hand, love this idea because they think that students these days do not get enough reading time in and a book club would be a good idea. If the student president would not have asked the teachers if they liked the idea there would be no book club ",

Even though electors votes it can lead to more of an unoraginized distaster. it can mainly lead to a lot of confusion and miss counts. a lot of people do not like the fact of electors being one just like the presidnet of untied states.  The article \"The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong\" written by Bradford Plumer states, \"The single best argument against the electoral college is what we might call the disaster factor. The American people should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century; the sytem allows for much worse. Consider that state legislators are technically responsible for picking electors, and that those electors could always defy the will of the people\". This means that the people never know if their electors are going to go back on their word and vote for another candidate.  The voters are left with an unfair outcome at almost every election because of the Electoral Collage. The votes can either be very close or the people could miss Ads or campaigns for canidates, leaving the people with nothing and confusion all over. Even if you knew what elector you voted for, you cant necessarily pick who it is your voting for and your vote could possibly get confued giving you a bad outcome. Most elections are just slid by and are just based on what ever the Electoral College thinks should happen. So please abolish the Electoral College its is irrational and is not neccessary, let the people really have a fair chance.  \"The single best arguement against the electoral college is what we migh call the disaster factor.  So if you live in a state like Texas for example, your votes goes to 34 Democratic electors that you don't know and this can create confusion about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate. The best argument about the electoral college is the disaster factor. It happen once in 1960 where \"Louisianna legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who oppose John F. kennedy,\" Which means that those popular votes for Keenedy would not actually gone to him. Bob Dole says the electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational.  for example \"each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee\" although each party chooses a trusted elector many can betray the party and select the other party. Also the betray can cost the presdient election dearly for instance Bradford stated \" back in 1960, segregationists in the Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. kennedy.(So that a popular vote for kennedy would not have actually gone to Kennedy)\". In other words the electors can ruin the president campaign and may cost most of the states problems.  Many argue that without the Electoral Collage equal power would be given to the people and that \"most people worry is the prosepct of a tie in the electoral vote\"-source 2.  Source 2 informs readers that state legislators are are technically responsible for picking electors. These electors could very easily decide to vote upon who they would like to see in office, rather than who the citizens want. The impact of this would be trecharous when the wrong person is elected as president. Source two quotes, \"Back in 1960, segregationsists in the Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the democratic electors with new electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy.\" This means that a popular vote for Kennedy would not have actually gone to Kennedy. How is that for a compromise between Congress and U.S voters?  Abolishment of the Electoral Collage would not give power to all states and, would highten potential for bias political leaders.   I get that they have to monitor the votes but arnt we already using electronic computers to vote... I think voting would go alot smoother if the votes went strait to the presidents through computers instead of having an elector who has a strong personal opinion against one political party who has a chance of twisting the votes around to strongly support the political party that he/she is opinionized towards. This why the Electoral Collage is dangerous. There have been cases of law breaking electors twisting the votes around. It is alot more safe to just let the citizens to just strait up vote. ",

When they tell you their end it may impact you and stop you from doing something you wouldn't have wanted to do. Others' opinions can also show you what consequences there might be for your actions. They might tell you the possibilities of what might happen when you say that. People opinions can greatly impact what you do.  Instead, someone should always seeking multiple opinions to help with choosing what to do because it can insure that they make the best choice. When a person makes a right decision, this does not only give them a decision that they will not regret, but it will also save them from wasting time and money. Choosing the right thing to do now can also help them in the future when making decisions related to their past scenario. The decision someone makes might seem small on the outside, but truly when a good choice is made, this can change a persons life for the best. That is why making a right choice is important, and a person can only make the best decision when they have talked with more than one person.\u00a0   \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  Just because they didn't take part in the chess\u00a0club, or the yearbook committee doesn't mean that they should be held back. Someone could be the next Albert Einstein and focus on school so much that he didn't have time for extracurricular activities, but you decide to hold him back because of a silly little thing he didn't do. Whether students do extracurricular activities or not shouldn't determine if they proceed to learn new things. The administrators should look at their grades and their work habits. It does not make a valid reason for them to be robbed of their opportunity to be smarter, if they just didn't participate in an extracurricular activity.  Now this statement may seem contradictory at first. \"How would having to go through more words, people, and ideas help me to get to a clearer understanding of my situation? Wouldn't that just cloud up everything?\" you ask. Well, actually, it does the complete opposite! If you only have one opinion, there's less of a chance that you will find the right answer. It's good to narrow down your points once everything you need is presented, but when you have little to almost nothing to go off of in the first place, it's less likely that your choice will be properly informed. Another reason that you may have trouble only going off of one person, is that somebodies advice could be very biased, which could cloud your mindset from the get go. When someone's advice is based only off of their opinion of the person or thing and not your situation or well being, it can be confusing at best, and directly harmful at worst. Finally, there are plenty more options you can choose from as well. This can make it easier to get the exact answer you need. Think about it like looking for an exact brand of paper you need for work . You may not find it at the first store you go to, you might have to drive around town to find it. All and all, having multiple opinions gives you more things to consider, making it easier to come to your conclusion.  While the Electoral College may seem like a sure fire way to assure that we get a president, that doesn't really mean the majority wants that president. Think about it, we don't always get the president we voted for. Popular vote doesn't really matter, it's like saying you voice doesn't matter to the government.  but with time, things change, and just because we've used something for a long time, doesn't mean we shouldn't upgrade.  so that they do not waste time on a project that may not even be right.  Now  I will conclude my reasons on why people should seek multiple opinions to help them later on. So as you can tell after reading this finding more opinions is very helpful and could change your life in some ways. However this does not mean that every first opinion you get is wrong it just means that it dose not hurt to have\u00a0multiple opinions to choose from. Like I said in sports and In basically anything in life it helps because you will always have choices to make and getting more opinions might just come up big for you. After going over my essay of why you should get multiple opinions then I hope you consider seeking more than one opinion next time you need an opinion on something.   \u00a0  It doesn't matter if you have a mistake or two in your idea that was pointed out by someone. What matters most is that you asked people for their opinion, and having the best idea you can have. When you ask people for their opinion, it gives you inspiration, courage, and perseverance to keep on doing your best, because in the end, it can turn out to be the best thing you ever did, maybe receiving a ton of money, winning awards for your accomplishments, or meeting other famous people who also like and use your idea on a daily basis. If your idea just doesn't work out in the end, you could either ask more people for their opinion on how to revive your idea, or it can be your end to the project and give up on the idea. Either way, it can at least be the most fun you've had working on an idea in your life.  In conclusion, getting multiple opinions on decisions before making them is never a bad idea. The things I believe, such as that multiple opinions provide open-mindedness, multiple similar reccomendations can be reliable, and that listening to suggestions does not mean one needs to follow them, have made me believe that it is always practical to take other ideas into consideration and decide which option works best in whatever situation one is in.\u00a0 ",

Whether it is cleaning the streets, helping out in an old peoples home, or tutoring children at a school, all these deeds are good experience and good for the community.  I believe that all students in school should take part in community service to help out their city, state, maybe even world. Students should at least have one day a week of community service  This is because they are constantly helping people out, and doing the right thing. This way they will feel good about themselves, and will be a better person overall. I am a boy scout, and i always participate in activities such as, help cleaning up a state park, and help cleaning up the Connecticut River. After i do these things, i feel ready good about myself because i did the right thing, and helped out our community a lot. Furthermore, scientist have shown that students who do community service have a better chance of having a happy life than people who don't, because you will always feel good about yourself and how you have helped your community.  For an hour we could do things like clean up garbage. We could do things for the people and help our senior citizens, help the children of working parents, or even help people who are having dangerous though and who are unhappy. Also we could build something, maybe help build a park or even a new building. If any of these things were done it would benefit the community tremendously  I think you should require it, at least to the 8th graders, because we need to start taking more responsibility in everything we do, and we would be helping our city and the people and animals that live around us, and we would be helping the future people living in this city by keeping it clean for them.  Many people think for themselves and only themselves. They are not qualified to make choices for the sake of the whole country, that is where the electors come in. These are people chosen by state conventions, state party committees, and sometimes candidates themselves. They hear the ideas of the people and manage them so that they are able to help everyone. They are pro politicians whose job in life is to preserve our country   In conclusion, Mr. State Senator, I think that keeping the Electoral College is the best thing for our country. If we changed to election by popular vote, the man (or woman) might not be the best for our country, and the best man might not win because he is not a regional favorite. I hope, sir, that you will take my letter into account when you go to vote on this topic.       \u00a0     But by doing community services each of us is doing something subsidiary. I think if we all do this we can make our community a better place to live in and i assure your that after doing so many good and helpful things toward others, in the end you will feel and be a better person.  my belief is that America needs to evolve. The people are in need of better public transportation and infrastructure. If we can create vehicles that can transport people at high speed and wove our transportation issues in America. We can pay for it and create with the help of tax payer dollars and companies willing to work with the government. If we follow the basic outline put forward and expand upon it we can achieve many things and creat many things the people of America and the world need.  We wouldn't have a lot of things if it weren't for the kind act of other people. For example, what people are doing in Haiti is a kind act of helping. The water wells that are being built there are helping the Haitians so they can have clean drinking water and cleaning water. I am sure that the Haitians are very thankful that there are people in the world that care. ",

If there was no Electoral College, the Nation could be in a lot of trouble because many votes would be casted off of popular opinion. So it is good to have some control over what happens and who becomes president, but I think having the full decision to vote for whomever, and have it count, is overdoing it.  The first and foremost reason why the Electoral College should no longer be kept in the U.S is because it will only lead to negative consequences. This has been observed in the past, and it must be prevented from occuring once more. One element of this disaster factor is that electors could defy the will of the people.  because if a voter has voted for example Obama for the electoral vote but voted for Romney for the popular vote it would be unorganized because of the split vote between popular and electoral which is recquired the majority of when in a public govermental election which could impact the whole future for the nation. The election for Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992 they both had only a 43 percentage plurality of popular votes while also winning a majority in the electoral college which was (301 and 370 electoral votes) . When no candidate fully wins the majority of the votes that were casted they wouldn't have to recount the votes of have a re-election which would drain the economies money because of the high amount of money put into one election in the first place just to have another election, whereas the electoral college can just step in and rectify the situation just by producing a clear winner on their own instead of going through a long process just to find out who the clear winner is all they have to do is debate among themselves who they believe the people would be happy with in the long run .   The Electoral COllege votes work so that the population of a state directly effects the amount of votes that states recieves. For example, Wyoming only has about 500,000 voters so it only recieves one electoral college vote. Because there is only one vote for wyoming, the 500,000 voters do not have acurate representation in a vote that has a total of 270 electoral votes.  In large states, where this a majority of either republican or democrats, voters may think that if they are in the minority, and the other party will surely win the election, what's the point of voting. If there was no Electoral College, the votes that they put in could contribute to the greater pool of that parties voters, while with Electoral College the votes are pointless and basically disapear. That, to me, is robbing the citizens of the U.S. of thir right to vote. According to Richard A. Posner, the Electoral College restores some of the weight that the large states hold in a presidental election. However, the large states may not have all of one party and those other votes can really make a difference.  The Electoral college is corrupt and needs to go away.  Furthermore, another way in which keeping the Electoral College would be disastorous would be seen in the case of a state sending two states of electors. Bradford Plumer reminded those in favor of the Electoral College that this has happened in Hawaii in 1960. Luckily, enormous downfall was avoided because Vice President Richard Nixon, presider over the Senate, validated his opponent's electors and did so \"without establishing a precedent.\" However, America may not be so lucky the next time this may take place. Senators in each and every state must open their eyes and really see what is happening in their country. The U.S must change its elections to the popular vote system, where all of these impacts will be avoided. The Electoral College does nothing for its citizens, and states may send two states of electors to it, and for these reasons, America will face a very unhappy situation if we keep this system.  But the Electoral College avoids the problem of there being a run-off election. If there was no Electoral College, this would put pressure for run-off elections, which would greatly complicate the presidential election process, which it invariably produces a clear winner.  In conclusion, the electoral college needs to be extinguished for many reasons. those reasons are because it doesn't let the people vote for who they want and it over rules a notions votes. And because it doesnt show the number of votes as equall. Some may say that it is good because it prevents a tie but if there is a tie then I'm sure htere are better ways to revote. we need government for the people, by the people and that isn't what the electoral college is.    If there was no Electoral College candidates will be fighting for the popular vote. The problem with this popular vote is that there would be no candidate that recieves a majority of the votes. In an Electoral College there would not be this problem, since in each state the winner takes it all. ",

That, to me, is robbing the citizens of the U.S. of thir right to vote. According to Richard A. Posner, the Electoral College restores some of the weight that the large states hold in a presidental election. However, the large states may not have all of one party and those other votes can really make a difference.  Besides, the popular vote doesn't matter in the decision for president it elects members for the electoral college. So if I wanted to vote for a republican president but the electoral college ends up voting for the democrat I would have wasted my time going to vote. Clearly, the electoral college's vote overrules the popular vote.  One major problem with the Electoral College voting system is that it limits representation of the people.  if you live in a mostly Democratic state as a Republican, your vote is regarded as nothing, and you would have no reason to vote in the electoral college, instead of throwing your vote into the entire mass of the united states, where it has a chance to even slightly influence the vote.

                "content": "Education should always come before sports, and if one can get by with C's or D's and continue to participate in Football or whatever else pleases them, then they won't be driven to complete their work with an effort, because they don't need to achieve in academics to achieve in their sport. Education is number one, then comes Football, or Soccer, or Baseball, or Track, and the leniency with academic performance doesn't support that basic fact.  When considering whether or not to allow children to participate in sports or other activities without an average above a C, what one must remember is that everyone has their own strengths and weaknesses. Yes, many people excel in academics, but there are others, who math and science just don't click with them. By saying these more athletically inclined individuals cannot participate in their medium, you take away one of their great pleasures. Some kids get a rush when they find out they aced their midterm, but others take greater pleasure in scoring the winning touchdown or participating in a club where you help others.  If a student excels in a sport, he or she should not be limited to access of achieving their goals in this sport because they are not at a high academic level. Limiting their ability to participate in what they excel in can take away many opportunities. For example, one of your students has the skill to play on a professional sports team, but unfortunately they are not allowed to participate in sports at school because they have a C average. A C average today in math class doesn't determine their future as a MVP.  It will ensure that only those who are willing to do the work and try hard will appear on the sports teams and academic groups, bettering the program. Yet I also feel that this pushes the boundaries of the 'no pass no play' rule very far.  The students who are very dedicated to the sport or activity that they love would definitely push themselves for better grades. I believe that some of the students who participate in the activities at our school do not have a B average. Most likely because they are so dedicated to their sport that they forget about the schoolwork. If one of these students found out that you are changing the rule then they would change their attitude towards school so that they will not get kicked off their team.   But since the prices for college tuition is going up not many students have enough money to attend college right after high school. Many of those students also have a grade C average. Also many students who are very good at sports but not very academically skilled may see that sports are what help them get by in life. Those students also find it very difficult to get into a good college they can afford if they have a grade C average but do not have a chance to get into a college if they cannot get a scholarship for athleticism.   some students have a c grade average and are on many of the sports hear at school some work very hard for that c because school is guest to hard for them. i bet if it was there choice they would have a A or a B. But not everyone has the same brain so school will be difficult for some student than others.  To get into better universities, they will not accept grades that are not exceptional, let alone standard. I believe these students are trying to \"just get by\" in their class work, leading them to become irresponsible, lazy, and completely oblivious to the fact that the better jobs out there require more than a \"standard\" degree. Most school athletes believe that right out of high school, they will be drafted into a professional sports career, and for some, it is true. However, the statistics of ever making it into a professional league is slim, and for those who don't make it, and sadly don't care about their education, and end up getting a job that pays little to none and wishing that they did what they were supposed to do in school.  You could offer an after school study hall or even have other students tutor them. Anything that could help get them going would be great. I'm in sports myself and i love them and can tell you if I was prohibited from them because of my grades I would immediately try to find help or work as hard as i could to bring them back up.  I myself am in many extracurricular activities, i play many sports, i play in the band, and i sing in the choir, i have a sports practice every night, and i have homework to do after that. To me, requiring community service would set me over the limit. I myself am already extremely busy every night, and having to worry about getting my community service projects done would be too much for me to handle. ",

The American people should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century; the sytem allows for much worse. Consider that state legislators are technically responsible for picking electors, and that those electors could always defy the will of the people\". This means that the people never know if their electors are going to go back on their word and vote for another candidate.  \"The single best arguement against the electoral college is what we migh call the disaster factor.  In source two, Bradford Plumer mentions the single best argument against the Electoral College, which he calls the \"disaster factor\".  Accoriding to bradford plumer he qoutes that \" The single\u00a0 best argument against the electoral colloge is what we might call the disatser factor\" (source 2). Even though electors votes it can lead to more of an unoraginized distaster. it can mainly lead to a lot of confusion and miss counts. a lot of people do not like the fact of electors being one just like the presidnet of untied states.  the 2000 election only a glimpse of the chaos that could result from the Electoral College. The disaster factor is a strong argument against the Electoral College. Consider 1960, when Louisiana segregationists came close to replacing Democratic electors with ones who wouldn't support Kennedy (11). Also along those lines, electors are bound by nothing but obligation to vote for the candidate of their party, and sometimes change their decision upon voting. Even if it only happens occassionally, it is yet another fault in this system.  No system is perfect, and the Electoral College is not exempt from this. \"The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong\", Source 2, argues that a term called 'disaster factor', or the possibility of immenent disaster due to the Electoral College system, is why the Electoral College system should be abolished  So if you live in a state like Texas for example, your votes goes to 34 Democratic electors that you don't know and this can create confusion about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate. The best argument about the electoral college is the disaster factor. It happen once in 1960 where \"Louisianna legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who oppose John F. kennedy,\" Which means that those popular votes for Keenedy would not actually gone to him. Bob Dole says the electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational.  In The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong by Bradfor Plumer, Plumer explains that one of the best arguments against the Electoral College is that the rate of disaster is so high. In 2000, there was a elctoral crisis based upoun the Electoral College, because Al Gore recieved more individual votes, but George W. Bush still won the election.  Another reason, why the Electoral college is a disaster factor is becuase most of the United States citizens prefer a direct election to the kind we have now, Electoral College. More presiciely 60 percent of voters to dont want the electoral college, that's majority of our population! If majority of our nation is against the electoral college why haven't we abolished it?  In conculsion, \"It's offical: The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. The best arguments in favor of it are mostly aserations without much basis in reality\", according to Source 2.  I would like you to consider all the problems our nation is facing due to the Electoral College. I have stated two contentions of why you should abolish the Electoral College; First,the method of how its done is very bias and unfair and secondly, because the Electoral College is a \"Disaster Factor\" or  causes many disruptions in our country.

Just to add insult to injury, this means that larger states are more fought over by politicians, leaving smaller states practically ignored. This is unfair to people in the Dakotas or Montana have no information to base their votes on, instead just picking a canidate by mainly party affiliation. the biggest political battles are in fact fought over the biggest states, in the forms of advertisements and propaganda. Although the propaganda is truely just that: propaganda, there is some truth in them, and the voters in bigger states are more well versed in the political and practical advantages of one canidate over the other. Article 3, while defending the Electoral College, in fact condems itself, by saying that voters in so called \"swing states,\" where there is no true dominant party, are likely to be given the most information on the canidates as they battle over who will get that state's votes in the college. The same thing can be said for the bigger states, because neither politician can really afford to let the other gain the upper hand in that state. Therefore smaller states, or states that are basicly marooned on one party are ignored or disregarded as worthless and unattainable in any case, so they widthold information from them, forcing them to vote blindly in favor of whichever party they choose, which votes may be discarded anyway. With an uncensored popular vote, the political canidates will be forced to advertise for all of the united states, instead of just the bigger or indevisive states. this will also remove all of the unfair advantages from the larger states, including more information as well as an unfairly weighted voting system.  This would be very unfair to the smaller states for an obvious reason, population. Even though a few states might have a bigger population that doesn't particularly mean that everyone in the state will vote. There are still \"independent voters\". For example, as stated in paragraph twenty-one, the election voting in Florida was very close and relied a lot on popular votes. Florida ended up getting twenty-nine electoral votes, compared to Wyoming who only got three electoral votes. State size does matter because larger states will typically always get more attention from the presidential candidates than smalller ones.  This might lead the small states to not vote because they feeel that they would not make a difference. Source #3 claim the following, \" So, other things being equal, a large state gets more attention from presidential candidates in a campaign than a small state does....\" When bigger states have more electoral votes, the candidates will be lead to thinking that if they get the bigger states, for example California who gets 55 electoral votes, to be in their favor then they might have a bigger chance at winning which will have the small states, like Hawaii who only gets 3 electoral votes, thinking that they have no say as to who gets to be their president. This claim is supported by source #3 when it is stated, \"\u00a0 Knowing their vote will have no effect, they have less incentive to pay attention to the campaign than they would have if the president were picked by popular vote\".  \"It avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of vote cast.\" as stated in the article by Richard Posner. It balances the votes by a larger state compared to a smaller state. In article \"In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to kep our despised method of choosing the President\", the author states that a larger state has more popular votes rather than a small state. The author says this, \"The popular vote was very close in Florida [in 2012]; nevertheless Obama, who won that vote, got 29 electoral votes. A victory by the same margin in Wyoming would net the winner only 3 electoral votes.\" As that being said, the author is explaining how larger states get more attention from a presidential candidates in a campain than a small state does. This is when the Electoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment.  I believe that we shouldn't change the Electoral College for popular votes the way we arevoting now is working just fine and it makes it so larger states like Texas don't get more of an impact on the election because of thier population than smaller states like Rhode Island. Also the Electoral College prevents Run-off elections. Even though some believe the Electoral College as an anachronism I think that the Electoral College is still a good way of voting.  The number of electors per state under the Electoral College is determined by the number of representatives the state has in congress. \"... one for each member in the House of Representatives plus two for your senators...\" (Office of the Federal Register 3). Since this system is based on population, bigger states get a emense priority over smaller states. \"The popular vote was very close in Florida [in 2012]; nevertheless Obama, who won that vote , got 29 electoral votes. A victory by the same margin in Wyoming would net the winner only 3 electoral votes.\" (Posner 21). This means that presidential candidates are going to focus on appealing to larger swing states that have more electoral votes, rather than smaller ones who only provide a few votes. That is not fair now is it? No matter how small a state may be its population still consists of United States' citizens, and they deserve just as much say as a bigger state. After all, that is the concept our country was founded on, equality and freedom.  Candidates mostly pay attention to states that have more electoral votes, this causes them to pay more attention to the bigger states and leave out the smaller ones, as already argued, some states get more electoral votes than others. Another reason why this is bad is because most states will not pay attention in the election because they will not make a difference. If popular vote were to be in action, then more people and citizens will pay attention because it will be a more interesting election since more epeople have a say and the candidates will pay attention to all states. Even the bigger states with more electoral votes know that they are the ones to basically decide the election.  In 1960, a group of segretationists in the Louisiana legislature almost succeeded in removing electors who supported John F. Kennedy with those who opposed him. If this had happened, all of the states electoral votes would have been cast by biased electors, rather than by the actual voters themselves. In the same year, Hawaii sent two state electors to congress instead of one. It is sad that we maintain a system in our government that continues to let issues like this arise. Along with issues with the electors, why is it that the size of a state automatically gives it a bigger advantage in elections? Texas and California are the most two saught-after swing states in every election. Candidates will do everything they can to win over those electoral votes. But what about the little states? Many of the smaller states do not get visited by candidates. Some never even see campaign ads. This system we are using creates target areas in the United States that are more valuable in elections than others. This is in no way fair to the voters in smaller states, despite having the exact same rights as voters of bigger states.  In an election their really is a process of voting and voting again. Instead of couting the number of people who want a certain president and so on. We are viewed as a state and some states having more say than other even if the votes are in the same margin. This is the reason why some states are focused on more by the candidates and are heavily educated on the topic and given more attention than smaller states whose votes wont change much. an even bigger problem is te fact that most states operate on a winner-take-all basis so even a slight majority vote one way will give that person all of the votes. A very worrying prospect as expressed in source two is the possibility of a tie. in which the election would be given to the house of representatives. Each state only gets on vote so a representative representing 500,000 people would have as much say as representatives representing 35 million people.  This is why Wyoming has only three votes and Florida has twenty nine. It's nothing to complain about, because it's the same number of people each state has in both the Senate and the House of Representatives, meaning each state has at least three votes, decided by its population. This is not a very bad system because the states with huge populations have a bit of their power curbed by the number of electors. So if Wyoming increases its population, and Florida has its population decreased, one of the electors could be removed from Florida and added to Wyoming, balancing the scale of power between them. It's only fair for a populous state like Florida to have more electors anyway, there are many opinions that are yearning to be heard within the ginormous population, and there must be enough electors who can take it upon themselves to voice them. The Electoral College protects us from the probability of voting just because the candidate is from the same state. A majority of people will vote because of a close association with a candidate if the electoral college is abolished. This is why the electoral college only contains 538 people, because nobody wants millions of voters in California voting for the same candidate just because they are the Governor of California. ",

The Electoral College has been there from the beginning, and the without it the United States of America could be thrown into chaos. Traditions shouldn't be broken and the Electoral College represents the biggest one of them all, it balances power between each of the states, defines a true winner, and guides the U.S. on a set timeline. It wouldn't be a far stretch to say that the Electoral College helps keep the order of the country. Truthfully, everyone needs some semblance of order, and the Electoral College provides that and more.     All and all, the Electoral College is the best way for voting. With this system, there are many benefits to the election process that people may not realize. With benefits like it avoids run-off elections and it makes the voters more aware, some people still beleive that a popular vote is still the best way. It is important to remember that there is a reason that we have certain methods, to benefit our country. And that is what the Electoral College is, a benefit to our country. So senator, and based on the evidence given, it is important to keep the Electoral College for all the benefits it brings and for the sake of our great nation that we live in.       Our Electoral College system should be defended and kept. It has the ability to produce a solid outcome, has flaws but ones that are not more disasterous than other systems, and drives candidates to try and present a national appeal. A single vote does not decide an election, the representation of our people should not be split in half, divided. The Electoral College does its best to give the nation the president it deserves.  One may argue that the Electoral College is a good thing and must stay for the benefit of the American people. With large states such as Texas and California, swing states, run-off elections, and certainty of outcome, they have a valid point  The Electoral College is something that this country needs for our benifit.\u00a0 It helps us Americas get a President that will benifit us all not just those in certaint areas.\u00a0 Although some peopel dont think that the Electoral College is helping there are twice as many people who believe that just a popularity vote is a bad idea.\u00a0 Having swing states, and having a way that finds \"everyones\" president are just few of the many exaples about why we need the Electoral College.  the Electoral College has always been a good way to elect our leaders, and it is the best way to do it  Although the Electoral College has a few appealing qualities, it is mostly an unfair system for the United States. The colleges should not have the power to decide the president, that should be the people that reside in the country's choice. Thomas Jefferson spoke of the people taking control of their country's government and the citizens of America should do just that if they are ever to escape the grasp of the Electoral Colleges  The electoral college is something that has been loved, hated, and debated on for some years now. We couold abolish it or keep it the way it is. Some say the electoral college is undemocratic and unfair to the voters and the candidates. But some say it is the best way to vote.  All in all, the Electoral college has both its good things and their downfalls. As can be seen the bad out ways the good in this situation. A voters vote isn't necessarily direct because they aren't voting on a single representative, they are voting on a group of individuals in which they believe will vote for the candidate in which they choose. Also, being that the number of electors is based on a state's number of congressional represenatives it is an unequal and unfair number of electors per state. The electoral college can even cause an uproar if a tie ever falls in place because the \"tie breaker\" is left in the hands of the House of Representatives. Basically \"the electoral colleg is unfair, and irrational\" (paragraph 14) and it should be abolished because there is a great amount of mix ups and failures within the system itself.   ",

The electoral college is irrational, and unfair.   The electoral college is not only obsolete, unnesessary and parasitic, but also unfair to many voters. The main ways this unfairness can be identified are extreme, and each really deserve a paragraph of their own. Let us imagine a scenario: a democrat lives in a mostly republican state  The electoral college is unfair, being that voters don't always control who their electors vote for, opposed to election by popular vote.  The Electoral College is stupid and we should not use it.\u00a0 I have many reasons to believe that this is an unfair system that is adulterating our country's wonderful ways.   The electoral college is very unfair.  In the article I read, it stated \"At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters. unfair, outdated, irrational\" I agree completely  most importantly, the electoral college is unfair to voters .  Most people think that the electoral college is not reasonable. I don't think they're wrong.  at the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters.   As you can see I am in favor of changing the elctoral college to election by popular vote for the president of the United States of America. Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and the AFL-CIO all agreed on one thing, and it was aboloshing the Electoral College. Under the Electoral College System they vote not for the president but for a state of electors who in return elect the president. Last but not least, the Electoral College is just unfair in so many differnt ways. These are reasons why I am not in favor of the Electoral College but in the favor to elect by popular vote for the president of the United States of America.      ",

They could also go tutor elementary school children like they mentioned that some of the kids do that. It would make the people your helping very happy or proud of the community.  In conclusion, my point is not to require students for community service. Because it's just of course like forcing us again. For what I heard , slavery wasn't allowed in United States. We should get the right to do as we may, according to the law. Not everything , but in this case, we have the right to say no for educated students to perform community service by will. Some good may take in this course, but not all good. Though you think it'll be good for us students, learn some things. But for us, it's unfair and cruel. Somehow if you're volunteering as I wrote. It's okay because that's by their choice. So as I write this again, I say no to requiring students of our age and skill to do community service.       So do you rather, making it a priority for your students to do community service or not? Do you rather them miss out on part of their education just to clean a field or to read to little children? Isn't that why we have teachers? Or do you want your students to be mad at their principle because there's not time to hang out or get all their energy out? Take it from me a student myself, you should let students have time to hang out its the best thing for kids our age. Making kids do community service may take that time up. Don't make it a priority for community service! Community service is not that big a deal!  Our teachers give us too much home work and not enough time to do it all and now if it becomes mandatory to do community service no one will have any time to do anything but homework and community service. That is unfair and unjust taking a way our personal time. Before the only time i had to myself was sleeping, and now i will have to spend that picking up trash. Or reading to the blind. Or tutor elementary school students. Or spending my time with old people that have Alzheimer's disease, who can even remember the last time they went to the bath room. That is a court sentence, not what you do for school.  Community services is also good because it is sometimes prerequisite for some high schools and colleges, which will make you look like a better person, being part of the community.  Community service is a very good thing to do, but I really feel that making it a school requirement will decrease the amounts of community service that is being done by students. As I stated before, requiring community service in schools will make community service stop being an activity that students enjoy, and so they will stop liking to do community service; which will have a bad effect on themselves and the community.   Hmm community service ? well i think that it is important because if people litter eventually out earth is going to be a total mess and the WILL be garbage everywhere , it would be a great task to do after school or on free time and importantly if you would be helping a student our education progress will most likely go up like fire works at the park on fourth of July  If the principle made students have a class for community service could you imagine the lack of education the kids can be getting. What about the lack of physical education? What if doing community service took up physical education classes?, How do you think your students would feel? Them not being able to run around and hang out will make them furious if id didn't have physical education I'd be angry too!  It will take our time when we have a lot of homework to do and we don't get it done. It will also take our time because when we want to go shopping or need to go do something it will take our time. If you want us to tutor elementary school children we would have time taken away from learning at school. We have almost the same school hours like them. So we would take our school time away. If we want to we could ask you more about it. I know that helping the community is good and very important but not to spend all your time on it. ",

This is demonstrated not only through group assignments, but through the participation of students during a class lesson. When a student is called on to share aloud, they are sharing an idea that may benefit someone else's learning experience, and help with their improvement and understanding of the curriculum in the class. School group projects allow students to share their ideas towards one another and further their comprehension of the relevant information. The students may develop a new way to perceive the topic, which, beneficially, is crucial for their success in the course and in the future. Ideas are not only defined through other students, but are defined through the professionalism the teachers carry in the course.  A reasonable method becomes clear when a young mind\u00a0uses the chance to ponder numerous alternatives because they serve as additional viewpoints as well as the opportunity to find the stability\u00a0in previously devised possibilities. In the end, what one thinks is best will be what they want to do. For their own well being, every source should be consulted and always thought over.  One might be thinking at this point, \"Come on now. This is great for all the kids who are motivated to learn and are enough of a go-getter to go out and do this stuff, but what about the ones who just want to sit inside and play video games or hang out with their friends?\"  so I think we should at least vote to it.  Now this statement may seem contradictory at first. \"How would having to go through more words, people, and ideas help me to get to a clearer understanding of my situation? Wouldn't that just cloud up everything?\" you ask. Well, actually, it does the complete opposite! If you only have one opinion, there's less of a chance that you will find the right answer. It's good to narrow down your points once everything you need is presented, but when you have little to almost nothing to go off of in the first place, it's less likely that your choice will be properly informed. Another reason that you may have trouble only going off of one person, is that somebodies advice could be very biased, which could cloud your mindset from the get go. When someone's advice is based only off of their opinion of the person or thing and not your situation or well being, it can be confusing at best, and directly harmful at worst. Finally, there are plenty more options you can choose from as well. This can make it easier to get the exact answer you need. Think about it like looking for an exact brand of paper you need for work . You may not find it at the first store you go to, you might have to drive around town to find it. All and all, having multiple opinions gives you more things to consider, making it easier to come to your conclusion.  You may think, \"It's nice that the students can find a friend, but what if there is nothing they would like or want to participate in?\"  When you ask for someones opinion you should listen carefully to what they have to say.  the person with a problem can think about a decision or problem more.  When you are asking someone about what you should do in a certain situation, you value their opinions and statements but are they the only person you should be asking? ",

Something needs to change because when you just walk outside of your house there's a piece of trash and you can help by just picking that piece up. If you could get all the students doing community service then those students could inspire other students or even their brothers, sisters or even their own parents. If just one person could help pick up a little trash then imagine what ten or even fifty people could do this world would be better in no time if everybody could just pitch in a little of there time everyday by making the world a little better.  The environment helps us by giving us air to breathe i think it's time to give back to the earth. Yes, it might take too much time away but we are doing it for a good reason and it is to live in a healthier, better community. They could do all they want during the weekends but it is better to help now while we can than to later on when we can't do anything about it. Also people that have asthma would help clean up the community because they don't want to get another asthma attack because people are polluting the air. If some people don't want to do community service that's fine because sooner or later they will regret it. We want people that have some kind of sickness to go outside and enjoy themselves. Most people that are sick or have heart conditions have to stay inside their home because it's too dangerous for them to go outside because we don't help keep the community clean and they might get an infection. When we go to school we should clean up after ourselves. Since people don't do that i think that they should do community service. I know everybody could do something even though if it's little it can still help out the community.  Some kids look at community service as a bad thing. When you think of community service most people would think of picking up trash. Say a student hated picking up trash but for community service made him pick up trash. He would learn form this to mot litter because there are people that go around and pick up trash and now he know what it is like. Another example is say a student helping out at a nursing-home. this student could of not like to be around old people. now he would be able to see that the elders are not that bad.  Some children for example need tutoring in certain subjects that you may be able to help with. Another example is cleaning up litter in your local park or just on the streets outside your house. Elderly people can get lonely sometimes and a great way of community service would be to write them letters for the holidays and bring them happiness. If you are interested in arts and crafts you can get together with friends and make artwork for sick children in hospitals. Other people love snow. If you're one of those people who love the snow, you can shovel your neighbors driveways next time it snows. The thing is that if they offer you money, you cannot accept it, you must kindly say no or then it would not be community service.  Also if somebody does, for example, cleaning up the beach as a community service project, they will likely miss trash and litter. This would be due to a lack of enthusiasm, and the person did not really contribute to society. So it is a lose-lose situation to be in, the kids complain that it eats up their time and the job does not get done.  Our teachers give us too much home work and not enough time to do it all and now if it becomes mandatory to do community service no one will have any time to do anything but homework and community service. That is unfair and unjust taking a way our personal time. Before the only time i had to myself was sleeping, and now i will have to spend that picking up trash. Or reading to the blind.

That is a court sentence, not what you do for school.  think that if you didn't have the students at our school do community service you would be doing them a great injustice. When we are so privileged to have a nice home, clean water, and a meal on the table every night we should at least be able to go out for an our or two and help someone else who isn't as privileged. Its hardly a great burden to get up from the computer or desk you are at, put on a pair of old jeans and a t-shirt, and go out and help. So I ask only one thing of you; please set aside one day, one measly day, to have all of the students in our school wander out into the community and help someone.  Already there is many students who don't study at all, and making all students do community service would discourage the small percentage who do. Doing things like cleaning and taking care of younger kids can be tiring. Even adults get tired of doing these things, imagine how a minor would feel. When a student is tired and has the choice to study or not they would most likely rather not; well after so much work they have just done. Not studying can lower test scores, and not to mention lower student grades.  Community service isn't a very good thing to make students perform at an early age. It takes away time and opportunities and gives too much responsibility to students. Students should be able to enjoy their childhood and not remember it as cleaning up litter.  Some people dislike community service since they like to be inside the whole day either in front of a television, on a computer, or playing a video game. So they think community service is boring and not worth their time, ",

Posner called \"In Defense Of The Electoral College:Five Reasons To Keep Our Despised Method Of ChoosingThe President\" he states \"there are...reasons for retainig the Electoral College despite its lack of democratic pedigree: all are practical reasons, not liberal or conservative reasons.\"\u00a0 Amongst these reasons one of them is the certainty of outcome and in source 3 paragraph 18 it states that \"A dispue over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is possible-it happened in 2000-but its less likely than a dispute over the popular vote. The reasons is that the winning candidates share of the popular vote.\" Richard Posner is stating that Electoral College is more effective because it causes less trouble and does not need to be disputed unlike popular vote which needs to be disputed because the winning candidiates share of the Electoral college invaribly exceeds his share of the popular vote.  Citizens' wishes will not always be equivalent to what the electors vote for. This occurs partly because of the winner-take-all system. In this system, the winner of the popular vote in an individual state wins all of the electoral votes a state has. According to the Office of the Federal Register, all but two states use this system. These two states are Nebraska and Maine. As a result of the winner-take-all system, it is possible that a presidential candidate loses the overall popular vote, but wins more electoral votes and thus wins the election. This occurance happened in the infamous 2000 election, when Al Gore won the popular vote but lost to George W. Bush by a mere five electoral votes. If the public indicated they wanted Al Gore as president, why should Bush have won due to this unfair system? It simply doesn't make sense. The winner-take-all system also results in political campaigns to focus their efforts in only certain regions. Some states very predictably vote either for the Republican candidate or for the Democratic candidate. Take Texas, for instance, which has traditionally always voted red. A Democratic candidate knows he should not focus his campaign in Texas, because he realizes his best efforts won't allow him to win the popular vote there and thus win the electoral votes. Because of the tendencies of certain states, many electoral votes are practically predetermined. The states which do not typically only vote in favor of one side are labelled \"swing states\". With the way the Electoral College works, the few states which are a toss-up carry the most weight. Presidential candidates will usually spend most of their time in these swing states, and very little time in others. For example, in the 2000 election, seventeen states were not visited by either candidate. Supporters of the Electoral College view the disproportional focus of campaigns as a positive. According to Richard A. Posner's article in favor of this corrupt system, \"The Electoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment of the Senate decreed in the Constituion...\" (21)  Mr. Richard A. Posner states in his article \"  In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President\"  that we avoid run-off elections. \"  The Electoral College avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast. For example, Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992 both had only a 43 percent of plurality of the popular votes, while winning a majority in the Electotal College (301 and 370 electoral votes, respectively).There is pressure for run-off elections when no candidate wins a majority of the votes cast; that pressure, which would greatly complicate the presidential election process, is reduced by the Electoral College, which invariably produces a clear winner....\"  The importance in the counterclaim is that it shows that the Electoral College process had a clear winner.  Altough many downfalls, \"The Electorial College restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states... lose\" and \"avoids the problem of elections in which no one recieves a majority of the votes cast,\"(Source Three, paragragh 21 and 22).  Also in \"In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the Presiden\" (Paragraph 22)take Richard Nixon's and Bill Clinton's presidental campaign. Those two only won 43% of their popular votes but they won their elections with the Electoral College. Without the Electoral College all three of these presides wouldn't have become President of the United States.  The electoral college process consists of selecting electors, as you know, but those electors do not always vote for their partie's candidates like they should. This process causes the popular vote to not always guarantee pesidency to a certain candidate even if they have the popular vote. In 2000 Al Gore had won the popular vote but lost presidency because of the electoral college. Not only did one inncident occur but multiple occur because of the electoral college. As stated in paragraph 11 of Bradford Plumer's article, in 1960 segregationists in Louisiana's legislature almost succeeded in replacing Democratic electors with new electors who opposed John F. Kennedy so if Kennedy got the popular vote he wouldnt have got the presidency. Like Bradford Plumer clearly stated \"the electoral college is unfair outdated and irrational.\" The electoral college should be abolished so that problems can be eliminated and elections are fair.  In an article by Richard A. Posner called \"In Defense Of The Electoral College:Five Reasons To Keep Our Despised Method Of ChoosingThe President\" he says \"nixon in 1968 and clinton in 1992 both had only a 43 percent plurality of the popular votes, while winning a majority in the Electoral College (301 and 370). There is pressure for run off elections when no candidate wins a majority of the votes cast; the presidential election process, is reduced by the electoral college, which invaribly produces a clear winner.\"     \"It avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of vote cast.\" as stated in the article by Richard Posner. It balances the votes by a larger state compared to a smaller state. In article \"In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to kep our despised method of choosing the President\", the author states that a larger state has more popular votes rather than a small state. The author says this, \"The popular vote was very close in Florida [in 2012]; nevertheless Obama, who won that vote, got 29 electoral votes. A victory by the same margin in Wyoming would net the winner only 3 electoral votes.\" As that being said, the author is explaining how larger states get more attention from a presidential candidates in a campain than a small state does. This is when the Electoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment.  In the first article \"What Is the Electoral College?\" by the Office of the Federal Register, the author asserts, \"Most states have a 'winner-take-all' system that awards all the electors to the winning presidential candidate.\" If a presidential candidate spends alot of time, effort, and money in a campaign for a \"swing\" state; he should be awarded all the votes for winning that state. It is a high risk but high reward to spend all that time and money to only earn sixty percent of the votes. That is why a \"winner-take-all\" is crucial. To add on, the author of the first article mentions, \"Each candidate running for President in your state has his or her own group of electors. The electors are generally chosen by the candidate's political party, but state laws vary on how the electors are selected and what their responsibilities are...\" This is saying that a candidate chooses his or her electors, and you vote for the electors to then choose the candidate you voted for  According to Source 2, the voters--the ones supposedly voting for our new president--vote for a group of electors instead. Due to the power of the Electoral Colleg, electors can vote for any candidate. This process we have every 4 years is truly un-democratic. For example, during the 2000 election, Al Gore was the candidate with the most popular votes--this meant that the majority of the citizens of the U.S. wants him to be president. However, Al Gore lost since the majority of electors from the Electoral College voted him. Lastly, in the case of a time, the lection will truly be un-democratic; the House of Representatives will have to choose the new president. ",

You can't go wrong with other people's help on choices no matter how big or small.  Say your making a big decision. Maybe Its a personal one or one at school or work. The decisions we make today will effect others. Sometimes positively and sometimes negatively. If you have an outsiders opinion, most likely you will become more empathetic. In our brain we usually only think of our own opinion. Our viewpoint. But, there are two sides to every story. We often forget about our peers opinions when making a decision. Having an outsiders opinion can help you learn other peoples opinions and point of views on the situation and it can help you learn how your decision can effect others. Maybe their opinion can help ween you in a different direction.  There are many people that have a hard time making decisions on their own.

I know this from personal experience because I'm a very indecisive person, and making big decisions stress me out a lot.

They all tell me their input and what they would do, and it calms me down and helps me think through it clearer.  when you ask more than one person for advice it can better your understanding because people have had different outcomes with similar experiences, your elders are wiser and can be another option for giving advice, and if you do not have people to support you and give you advice, people in your community and around the world post websites and blogs online.\u00a0Your peers, community, family, and friends are all there to support you and help give advice. No matter how big or small the decision is, someone is always there to help. Before making a life changing choice or decision ask multiple people for advice.\u00a0   \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  Sometimes it is better to have multiple people state their opinion before you make a big decision  Talking to more than one person before a choice or decision can be beneficial in many ways.  When making decisions people often look to others for advice. Whether the decision be where to go for lunch or something that would alter your life people seek others opinion. Often times going to more than one person to get advice can be a very beneficial thing to do.  People talk to more than one person for advice because they want to make a better choice. They want to hear what other people have experienced, their personal feelings about the situation, the pros and cons, how they view everything, so they don't feel anxious about it as much.  Having someone to talk to is very important for advice but just making better decisions from having multiple peoples advice is just as important.  The final reason is making better decisions, making better decisions can impact your life majorly ",

                "content": "It does look like it could be from another living organism, but it's just a rock on the planet. In our newest image of the rock, it turns out that the face has dissapered. There is no evidence of this being created by aliens, rather it was created by wind and water that has been found on Mars. The reason you might believe that this was indeed aliens, might be the fact that the news has blown it out of poportion. It's just the rock that had some interesting shadows and holes that made it look like a human face.  I find it highly unrealistic that NASA would even have been able to determine what the Face was forty years ago, much less hiding a discovery of extra-terrestrial life that could make a huge profit for the space program. And, had NASA really claimed that the Face was an object built by otherworldly life, surely someone would let the cat out of the bag. Not to mention that, if the vast majority of NASA believed it was an alien monument, do you really think that they would wait eighteen years to investigate the subject again? On top of all of this, it's simply illogical that aliens would create such a thing. As far as we all know, the supposed \"aliens\" on Mars have never come in contact with a human, much less seen one. That only leaves possible explanation; aliens created a monument that of which coincedentally resembles a human head. An absolute coincedence.  I must say that, in my opinion The Face on Mars is indeed NOT created by aliens. It is simply illogical.  There you have it. The Face sadly wasn't built by aliens, it was just a natural landform that happened to have some pretty neat features to it due to shadows. There is no way around it, because the pictures don't lie. It is even more obvious that it is a landform because ones just like it exist on Earth! Even though it would've been very interesting for it to have been actually created by aliens, it was just a natural landform in the end.  So, while some conspiracy theorists would like to think that aliens created this well-known face on Mars, they are incorrect. The face on Mars is just a natural landform that was wrongly perceived by the public. By advancing in digital technology, understanding the effect of shadows, and realizing that there is no evidence to support aliens on Mars, it can be concluded that the face on Mars is just another peculiar natural landform.  About twenty-five years ago, something happened around Mars. NASA, snapped photos of the object. On Mars, there is a face printed on the plant. People think it was created by aliens. NASA said it was created on it's own. Scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa. Those are common around Cydonia. A couple of days later NASA saw a nose, eyes, and a mouth.  In 1976 the face looked like a face. In 1998 it started to not look like a face at all. In 2001 it just looked like a rock. So i believe that it was not created by aliens but that it was just something the olanet had made itself. This has certainly got the attention of the people.  The \"Face on Mars\" is not a face. If you look at the pictures from 1976, and 1998, and 2001 and in the text it says that the photo from 2001 is the most recent photo that NASA has. It still looks nothing like a face so since the 2001 picture is the most recent it shows that it is just a natural landform. It is just a natural landform. On Mars there are natural landforms everywhere and the fade away. Here on earth natural landforms are created everyday.  Are you ready to accept the truth about the Face on Mars? I have listed valid, credible arguments including the high resolution of the 2001 photo, and the weak resolution of the 1976 photo. I also questioned the logic of extra-terrestrial life, and the logic that NASA would have used to cope with the discovery of aliens.  The author states that scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa when the face appeared. This shows that they have seen things like this before and they knew that it wasn't real, or alien like. Another example that the author proves is that Garvin said it reminded him of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. The camera on board MGS had to peer through wispy clouds to see the face and perhaps alien markings were hidden by haze. Also NASA can be hidding information about the Face. But, you can see that the Face is formed by shadows, and not an alien haze.  One reason that consiracy theorist could beleive that this could be an alien stucture is that the resolution of the first picture was very low. ",

'' Voters in presidential elections ae people who want to express a political prefeence rather than people ho think that a single vote may decide an election''.(source 3 , p.23). The Electoral College may have worked in the past but now its not working as well.  The voters are left with an unfair outcome at almost every election because of the Electoral Collage. The votes can either be very close or the people could miss Ads or campaigns for canidates, leaving the people with nothing and confusion all over. Even if you knew what elector you voted for, you cant necessarily pick who it is your voting for and your vote could possibly get confued giving you a bad outcome. Most elections are just slid by and are just based on what ever the Electoral College thinks should happen. So please abolish the Electoral College its is irrational and is not neccessary, let the people really have a fair chance.  because if a voter has voted for example Obama for the electoral vote but voted for Romney for the popular vote it would be unorganized because of the split vote between popular and electoral which is recquired the majority of when in a public govermental election which could impact the whole future for the nation. The election for Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992 they both had only a 43 percentage plurality of popular votes while also winning a majority in the electoral college which was (301 and 370 electoral votes) . When no candidate fully wins the majority of the votes that were casted they wouldn't have to recount the votes of have a re-election which would drain the economies money because of the high amount of money put into one election in the first place just to have another election, whereas the electoral college can just step in and rectify the situation just by producing a clear winner on their own instead of going through a long process just to find out who the clear winner is all they have to do is debate among themselves who they believe the people would be happy with in the long run .   To conclude the argument, Electoral College should forsure be removed. Citizens favor popular vote over an electors vote. Candidates and voters enter a whole different threshold to express their political preferance. Why should the government even have voting if there really not truly being seen in the correct way. Citizens want to take a stand and vote in what the mind believes in. Take out Electoral College, and let the voters vote, actually count.  Thus, the Electoral College is completely unfair to voters, and should be abolished. Voters should not have to vote for other votes which could very well defy their's, why not just have the Electoral Cllege do all the voting then? It is both redundant and unfair.     If the state uses a different system such as counting votes from different states, we wouldn't have as much problems we have with it now because the votes in the electoral college are outdated and irrational,  You can completely ignore some of your voters, as you're guaranteed to either win or lose heavily biased states, and you can gain massive numbers of electoral votes due to one more vote for a side in a state count  It can be argued that even with the conflict it provides the people a chance to make their votes count  Having popular votes system will be arguably the best system to use for the election and towards the voting process. Using electoral votes will be unfair to voters when they are voting because of the simply winner-take-all basis of each and every one of the fifty states. Not only that it's unfair, it also causes many crisis in the United States dealing with this system alone and then eventually lead to dramatic chaos across the nation. Also, having the amount of electoral votes doesn't compare to the population of the actual state. Remember it is still one representative for the 500,000 people in Wyoming. Popular votes should be used in every political system no matter what situation it is. As the passage says, the argument against direct elections are spuriors at the best.  The popular vote is a clear statement of voters' opinions and is virtually unable to be tampered with. On the other hand, the Electoral College only complicates the situation by introducing a middle man who is prone to bribery and mistakes. Why should we allow candidates to win because of the electoral vote if they do not recieve the overall approval of the public? Compare the opinions of 538 electors to the opinions of hundreds of millions of voters. Evidently, the opinions of all these voters cannot be properly represented by these 538 electors. It's just impossible both logistically and logically. ",

                "content": " Online distance learning would not benefit students because it takes away the option of direct communication which is key when it comes to learning new curricular. The chance of cheating and laziness increase with taking online classes because its based on your schedule and you learn from your own computer. Also it takes away from socializing with other students and making new friends to spend time with and also losing the option to try after school activities. Also students could have many issues accessing the lessons which would ultimately disrupt their learning. Some schools may offer the option to attend classes while at home but students wouldn't benefit as much as attending classes at school.   \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  Attending a class online at home is a great way to stay on pace and not fall behind because all of the information is at the student's fingertips and they can complete their tests and assignments when they are ready and able. They can still also do everything at home while they are sick if they would really like, since all of their materials is already with them on their computer. This way, the student will not fall behind in class, there is less stress, and they won't under perform\u00a0on their exams because they are still able to learn the information they need on their laptop as usual. On the other hand, if a student is sick and cannot go to school that day, they miss all of their class papers and notes from that day and cannot usually make up what they missed. For this reason, online courses are a much safer and reliable way of learning that do not have the stress of missing a full day of information at school. Online courses may also have to be used for every course anyway before long due to the rapid spread and worry over the lethal Corona Virus, which can close schools and put people in quarantine for weeks.  In conclusion, students will not benefit from attending online classes at home as they will get easily distracted and be less motivated to learn. If students are to properly balance their home life and their studies, a more reasonable approach that doesn't compromise their relaxation or student life needs to be found. Also, students who attempt to take an online class at home are more likely to be distracted by the comforts that are at their reach. The inability to forge relationships and connect with peers is another drawback of taking an online class at home. Likewise, the lack of opportunities to partake in in-class discussions creates barriers for students to succeed as active learners. Nobel Peace Prize winner and educational activist Malala Yousafzai once said,\"a paper and pen can change the world.\" Yousafzai overcame many hindrances before she could provide education to the girls in her village, so why do we undermine its importance? Education is a powerful tool that we must use to guide the future, it is not something that we can compromise on for comfort.  Many students in my school district need to be driven to their nearest bus stop to even be able to ride for an hour to attend their local high school. Inclement weather or lack of a ride forces many of my school mates to miss class. These absences can be counteracted with the introduction of online classes. Students will benefit from online courses and curriculum without having to worry about having their transportation needs met. Students will be able to participate in an online classroom and engage with others without having to step out of their own home. Weather or lack of a ride forces many bright students to miss out on critical learning opportunities because of circumstantial needs. These aforementioned situations are common around the country and the introduction of online classes will alleviate these unfortunate absences.  Many schools outside of the country don't provide transportation services similar to the US. Students in Germany take the metro to get to school and many other students are forced to ride trains or local buses to their high schools. This may cause many students to feel unsafe and administer a feeling of fear with going to school. In many cases, girls feel unsafe to ride local buses and trains alone due to fear of sexual assault or kidnap. Rape and sexual assault are horrid things to think about but are often times reality for many females (and males) on public transportation. Online schooling offers a way for students to take classes online without having to worry about these issues. It gives students a chance to learn without worrying about their safety and the safety of others.  Online classes or video conferences are far less effective because their curriculum is rigid. There is no teacher to allow social interaction and connection with students, but instead a computer with no mind, no heart, and no ability to judge student performance and change its techniques for teaching accordingly. Online learning takes away the opportunity for interaction and engagement in the learning process by making the curriculum seem repetitive and the assignments boring. Students of all three types of learning ability require stimulation from a teacher to remain engaged, but an online classroom setting is not the best way to engage students. They cannot, for example, stand and move in a certain way to demonstrate a concept, or have an in-person discussion. The ability to actively participate in education is vital, and online learning all but removes it.  The debate of online classes in place of traditional schooling is a complicated one. Allowing students to complete their academic career without actually attending school may help keep them on track, as they could continue to learn in situations that would otherwise require an absence, but at what price? Online classes cause students to miss out on important life lessons and practical skills, such as collaboration and time management, due the the structure of the assignments. Additionally, students will have less opportunites to interact with their peers and create long-lasting memories at school-sponsered events. For now, it is in the best interest of the children and the future society to keep students in the classroom. Allowing students to take courses online takes away from school's greater lessons and limits the social interaction that teens crave, despite the argument that it will help students keep on top of their studies in absent-causing situations.\u00a0  Online schooling and courses is just not the way to gain a proper education and it does more damage than anything else. Because people need other people taking them out of the class room for even one year for online schooling can have devastating impacts on the student and it may take years to reverse the damage. Risking vital aspects of success like the development of social skills and the brain is just not worth the easy courses of online schooling and should never be implemented into school systems. It sets you up to be steps be hide\u00a0your peers meaning you'll always have to play catch up. In the end online schooling isn't worth the all the struggles you'll have to face as an adult and in college and its my strong recommendation that you stay away from it.  By attending class online, students do not have to deal with the daily chores of waking up early, preparing for school, and in many cases rushing to leave in order to not be late. Being tardy for a class can be severely punished even if it was not directly the students fault, which could lower productivity and motivation. It is widely known that students complain about this dilemma\u00a0already, and with online learning, it can be solved in a simple and cost effective way.  Taking classes online and learning from home brings unwanted distractions such as having the need to sleep, watching TV, playing games and having to take care of kids while doing class at the same time. With these distractions, students are not able to get their classes and work done, they're not able to stay focused on their task which can result in bad grades and affect one's education. This can eventually lead to depression and failure which is very sad and dangerous and needs to be taken seriously. A student may even struggle to get their grades up having to constantly deal with these distractions while juggling classes online. Video conferencing is not great and students should go to a school building and study to best eliminate any possible distractions to learn.  If a person is Immobile, getting to school every day could be a great struggle. Most parents would want to do every thing to make it easier for them; one way to do that is with online schooling. You do not have to go anywhere to do online classes as you can do them all at home. If a person is particularly sensitive and stuck in the hospital 24/7, they could have a chance to do school through online classes. They too have a right to an education.  ",

Posner explains that the Electoral College \"restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment of the Senate decreed in the Constitution.\" The Electoral College gives larger states more attention from presidential candidates as opposed to a smaller state. Posner continues the idea with \"the most thoughtful voters should be the ones to decide the election.\" To break it down, voters who pay close attention to the campaign will be the most thoughtful voters and they will recieve the most attention from the candidates. This reduces the amount of disputes because the presidential candidates will decide on who to give the most attention to.  In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President\", author Richard A. Posner states that \"knowing [the voters'] vote has no effect [gives them] less incentitive to pay attention to the campaign.\" But, \"voters in presidential electons are people who want to express\u00a0 political preference rather than people who think that a single vote may decide and election.\" This means thatchanging everyone to a single vote will have no effect, too because people will not put thought into who to vote, but they will just vote for whoever.  Mr. Richard A. Posner states in his article \"  In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President\"  that we avoid run-off elections. \"  The Electoral College avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast. For example, Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992 both had only a 43 percent of plurality of the popular votes, while winning a majority in the Electotal College (301 and 370 electoral votes, respectively).There is pressure for run-off elections when no candidate wins a majority of the votes cast; that pressure, which would greatly complicate the presidential election process, is reduced by the Electoral College, which invariably produces a clear winner....\"  The importance in the counterclaim is that it shows that the Electoral College process had a clear winner.  In an article by Richard A. Posner called \"In Defense Of The Electoral College:Five Reasons To Keep Our Despised Method Of ChoosingThe President\" he says \"nixon in 1968 and clinton in 1992 both had only a 43 percent plurality of the popular votes, while winning a majority in the Electoral College (301 and 370). There is pressure for run off elections when no candidate wins a majority of the votes cast; the presidential election process, is reduced by the electoral college, which invaribly produces a clear winner.\"     In an article by Richard A. Posner called \"In Defense Of The Electoral College:Five Reasons To Keep Our Despised Method Of ChoosingThe President\" he states \"there are...reasons for retainig the Electoral College despite its lack of democratic pedigree: all are practical reasons, not liberal or conservative reasons.\"\u00a0 Amongst these reasons one of them is the certainty of outcome and in source 3 paragraph 18 it states that \"A dispue over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is possible-it happened in 2000-but its less likely than a dispute over the popular vote. The reasons is that the winning candidates share of the popular vote.\" Richard Posner is stating that Electoral College is more effective because it causes less trouble and does not need to be disputed unlike popular vote which needs to be disputed because the winning candidiates share of the Electoral college invaribly exceeds his share of the popular vote.  Also in \"In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the Presiden\" (Paragraph 22)take Richard Nixon's and Bill Clinton's presidental campaign. Those two only won 43% of their popular votes but they won their elections with the Electoral College. Without the Electoral College all three of these presides wouldn't have become President of the United States.  very four years there is an election.\u00a0 The election is used to decide who our president will be for the next four years.\u00a0 The Electoral College is currently being used for our elections.\u00a0 The articles \"Does the Electoral College Work?\" and \"In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President\" by Richard Posner believes the Electoral College should continue to stay in use.\u00a0 On the other hand, the article \"The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong\" by Bradford Plumer believes that the Electoral College should be removed from the system of electing the President.  The Declaration of Independence granted us the right to control our government. Thomas Jefferson once stated, \"When a nations government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the right of its people to abolish it and establish a new government.\" After viewing the articles Source 1:\"What Is the Electoral College?\" by the Office of the Federal register, Source 2: \"The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong\" by Bradford Plumer, and\u00a0 Source 3:\"In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President\" by Richard A. Posner it seems clear that the Electoral Colleges have lessened the power of the people in our nation. With the Electoral College method of selecting our nations new president the people of our nation become less empowered, they may cast their vote but the choice of president is never truly theirs. The Electoral Colleges drive people away from voting because they see the election as if their vote will not matter.  \"It avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of vote cast.\" as stated in the article by Richard Posner. It balances the votes by a larger state compared to a smaller state. In article \"In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to kep our despised method of choosing the President\", the author states that a larger state has more popular votes rather than a small state. The author says this, \"The popular vote was very close in Florida [in 2012]; nevertheless Obama, who won that vote, got 29 electoral votes. A victory by the same margin in Wyoming would net the winner only 3 electoral votes.\" As that being said, the author is explaining how larger states get more attention from a presidential candidates in a campain than a small state does. This is when the Electoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment.  There are plenty of reasons, and plenty of contradictions in \"In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to kep our despised mehod of choosing the President.\"  ",

Because if you force someone to do something, we wont like it.  Therefore community service should be recommended to students, not required because when people serve they should do it willingly, and if they don't they won't have a good attitude about it. Teenagers have a mind of their own so being told what to do bothers them to the point of them never doing it again, and some peoples life may be full of various activities already so they simply don't have the time for it.  I think that people shouldn't have to do community service unless they get into legal trouble such as a fight, and they are charged with assault. Or if someone steals something and they are charged with stealing.  I think community service should be something everyone does to help others, or to help the Earth.  I think community service is a great idea, but not all may agree. Although it may stop pollution, teach life lessons, and break them away from brainwashing electronics, they should be able to make their own choices. Therefore, i feel doing community service should be optional.  But by doing community services each of us is doing something subsidiary. I think if we all do this we can make our community a better place to live in and i assure your that after doing so many good and helpful things toward others, in the end you will feel and be a better person.  So just keep in mind that community service is a great thing to do, but if some people don't want to, you shouldn't force them.  Community service is important in the world because it helps support ideas like cleaning up our neighborhood to helping the needy. If we didn't have community service, the world may not be a place like it is today. But, everyone has to consider that it is a persons preference to choose to do community service and that they are not forced to do it. Our principal may be doing a good deed in saying that everyone should have to do a certain number of hours of community service, but some people may not be able to and they shouldn't be forced to do any work that they don't have to.  but i think that if each student does community service that maybe we could raffle a prize out every month or so, so that they could get motivated to do the service.

Even though things may get done quicker I think everyones voice should be heard.  Americans are not getting the representation we deserve. In fact, in a democracy, we should be representing our own beliefs, ourselves. The Electoral College must be totally abolished and the popular vote should become the new standard for political voting.   I believe this way because I think that the people should have the right to choose who represent their country, not the House of Representatives/Senate.  In conclusion, we, as the people of the United States of America, need to inderstand that the road we are headed down with the Electoral College, is not a good road. We need to stand up and allow everyone to be able to have a say in elections. With the popular vote every citizen will have they're own say in what gets made of our beautiful country. We, the people, need to make the change from Electoral College voting to popular vote becauseit gives people a say in who runs our country, an eaier way to elect someone into office, and no one state has more of a say than another.  because it unifies Congress and the people of America  The united states is a democracy so the citizens living here should have the right to vote for the president of the united states  Clearly, election should be determined by popular vote, and not the Electoral College because Americans earned their right to have full control over the representatives in their government  Many citizens in the United States vote for whom they believe will acheive the goals and standards of serving as the U.S President.

                "content": "Educators have a very important job. They are building the future for society, which can be very hard. Teachers have to deal with many students, and every student is different. With the use of the Facial Action Coding System, teachers don't have to worry about a teaching method that will not work with all students. In the article \"Making Mona Lisa Smile\" by Nick D'Alto it says that the system recognizes if a student is confused, and alters the lesson to better fit the student. This allows educators to not worry about finding a teaching method that suites every student. This technology also helps out educators, because it works one on one with students. It's made to help every student individually by reading the student's facial expressions. As student's learning patterns may change, the system changes with the student. The use of this technology will also be helpful for teachers because educators can take a look and see what teaching methods work the best with students overall. In the article it says the system can detect when students are confused and bored, so educators can use this technology to see what doesn't make students feel confused nor bored. This technology could be very valuable and helpful for educators.  According to the article \"Making Mona Lisa Smile,\" there is a new technology called the Facial Action Coding System (FACS) that enables computers to identify human emotions. This technology is relatively brand new. It creates a 3-D computer model of all fourty-four major muscles in the face that move like human muscles as well. Then, psychologists have classified six basic emotions that are associated with different movements in the facial mucles. This new technology could result in many benefits in our community as well as all around the world  In the article,\"Making Mona Lisa Smile\" by Nick D'Alto, it describes how the system can regognize how a student is feeling. The lesson changes depending on how the system reads the student's reaction. The system can read when a student is bored and change up the lesson. This is essential because it allows students to be more engaged in learning, since it will no longer be as boring as it was for them. The system may also help students to remain engaged in learning because nobody would be learning something the same exact way. In the article it says that lessons are modified to fit every student using facial recognition, so students would be learning in a way that suites them personally. This technology also keeps students more engaged because they would feel happier, because the system tries to keep students engaged and happy. In the article it says that the system can ready when people are unhappy, so the system would try to prevent students from feeling that way about learning. The system could really help students be more excited about learning.   In the sixth paragraph of the article \"Making Mona Lisa Smile,\" the author illuminates the possibilites of success human-emotion-recognizing computer software provides in terms the world of marketing, describing how analyzing the emotional response to a Web ad popping up on one's computer screen can mold the variety of its future ads to a more preferred selection (6).  The text states, \" Your home PC can't handle the complex algorithms used to decode Mona Lisa's smile,\" (D'Alto 7). This shows that normal computers that students would typically use cannot support this technology, making the school buy the technology that can support it. This would be a costly job and if the school cannot pay for it then the students would have to and some families may not be able to afford it  The implications of technology that can detect emotions simply by reading the muscles in the face sound truly remarkable. The thought that one can tell what another is thinking simply by plugging data or maybe even a picture into an algorithm sounds like fiction, but may soon be a reality. The article, \"Making Mona Lisa Smile\" by Nick D'Alto briefly discusses the possible use of such technology in a classroom. The system could examine student's faces, and if they read to be unengaged or uninterested, could adjust the lesson to make learning more interesting to that group of students. That type of technology could revolutionize learning, and customly tailor lesson plans to the feelings of students on any given day.  In the article \"Making Mona Lisa Smile,\" the author explains how certain algorithms built into a system, called the Facial Action Coding System, can detect human emotions. In the article, the author describes how a classroom computer can recognize when a student is getting bored or confused based on their facial expressions. This computer can change the way that the lesson is being taught so that the students are more productive in classes.  At the seventh passage, the author states that, \"Your home PC can't handle the complex algorithms used to decode Mona Lisa's smile,\" suggesting that the majority of modern computers do not have the power to actually run the software. The PCs that schools buy are almost never more powerful than the ones bought by consumers for household use, and would thus also not be able to process the data, making the technology rather useless in an educational setting.  In the article \"Making Mona Lisa Smile\" by Nick D'Alto it says that the system could \"modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor\". All students would be able to get helped individually, one on one with the system. The system also allows students to learn better because everyone learns things differently, and the system would be able to adjust for every student's learning style. In the article it says that the system can detect if a student is confused, so the system would be very valuable in classrooms because it would make sure that students are not confused. The system would make sure that students are actuallly comprehending the material.  Leonardo Da Vinci was one of the greatest reniassance painters of the time. His study of the human anatomy allowed him to create pictures that captured the humna state. On of his most well known paintings is the \"Mona Lisa\". The Mona Lisa is a women that has sort of complacent facial features. She doesn't really look happy or sad. This was the popular thought up until a new technology was created. This technology is called the Facial Action Coding System. This technology is able to deduce what emotion a person is feeling. It is able to do this whothout the person even showing an obvious emotion. This technology can also be implenmented in many spheres of life, including in the classroom. ",

According to Bradford Plumer in his article, \"The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong,\" in the early 1960s, people who favored races being seperated in society were almost able to replace Democratic electors with a new set of electors who supported the opposite party. Also, some corrupt electors who are not pleased with the popular vote will simply vote for whomever they please. Electors clearly have trouble being trusted and there is obviously some extreme dislike for the system we have now. The Electoral College also causes some problems when instances like a tie in the electoral vote come about. In this case, a tie in the Electoral College would be thrown to the House of Representatives, who would then vote for the President. The Electoral College brings about uneccessary problems that could all be avoided if the country converted the way of electing to election by popular vote.  Politics are very lowkey orders of buisness, and in 1960, the legislatures in Louisiana almost used the disaster factor to swing the election in their favor, by electing people who were more likley to vote for the opposer of John F. Kennedy, because they prefered the other canidate. According to source #3, paragraph 16, Posner addresses, \"..each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nomie (and that trust is rarely betrayed\". . . [; however,] it is entirely possible that the winner of the electoral vote will not win the national popular vote.\" Since the electors can technically vote for whoever they desire, it can cause an unfair advantage to the electors sent who vote for the other candiate  These People were Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and the AFL-CIO. Turned out their not the only ones according to the exerpt from \"The Indefensible Electoral College: why even the best-laid defenses are wrong.\" is sates \"They're not alone; according to a Gallup poll in 2000 taken shortly after Al Gore- thanks the quirks of the electoral college- won the popular vote but lost the presidency, over 60 percent of the voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now.\"  The people who despise the electoral college are in favor of popular vote since it is the better choice.  Third, according to the Al Gore-thanks to the quirks of the electoral college- won the popular vote but lost the presidency, over 60 percent of the voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now  Over sixty percent of the vters would like a more direct system of voteing (according to a Gallup poll in 2000). And so did Ritchard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and AFL-CIO.  As you can see I am in favor of changing the elctoral college to election by popular vote for the president of the United States of America. Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and the AFL-CIO all agreed on one thing, and it was aboloshing the Electoral College. Under the Electoral College System they vote not for the president but for a state of electors who in return elect the president. Last but not least, the Electoral College is just unfair in so many differnt ways. These are reasons why I am not in favor of the Electoral College but in the favor to elect by popular vote for the president of the United States of America.       The U.S government lets people choose these electors so they feel important in the choices our country makes. We take time to study our favorite candidates, and if the electoral college does not agree with them, they are pushed to the side. What happens to the people who did not vote for the, \"right\" candidate? They are forever unheard. Sentenced to live in a community where they are silcenced. I do not agree with the electoral college because agree with our fore father Abraham Lincoln. He said this was supposed to be a country of the people, by the people, and for the people.   In order to understand the flaws in the electoral college, you need to know what the electoral college is, and how it came to be. \"The Electoral College process consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for President and Vice President, and the counting of the electoral votes by Congress.\" (Office of the Federal Register 2). This system was created by the founding fathers as a compromise between the congressional vote and the popular vote. However there was a reason for this new, seperated voting system. During their time the founding fathers where among the most educated men in the country. Back then education was not standard and very few people could read or write. The founding fathers did not want uneducated citizens voting on the individual who would lead the country. So they created a system where the uneducated would vote for a group of educated men, who would in turn vote on a president. Thus the electoral college was born.  . From my knowledge, Under the Electoral college system, voters vote not only for the president, but for a slate of electors. \"Richard Nixon, Jimmy carter, Bob Dole, the U.S. chamber of commerce, and the AFL-CIO all, in their time agreed on getting ride of the electoral college!\" for example Al Gore won the popular vote but lost the presidency, over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now. Why dosnt the goverment just give us what we want?  if 90% of votes go to a candidate, then why would they not get the presidency? its common sense. ",

Also the electoral college\u00a0 represents the states votes. The reason is because electoral colleges are game changers and a trust worthy method. Certainly it wll be easier to choose a president and break ties.     The popular voting method is directly controlled by the people and their vote is sent directly to their desired candidate. On the other side, by using the electoral college method voters vote for a select member of the state's electoral college votes and that member is\u00a0 elgible to vote for any presidential candidate of their choice. According to the article \"In Defense of the Electoral College: Five Reasons to keep our Despised Method of Choosing the President\" by Richard A. Posner, \" when you vote for a presidential candidate you are actually voting for a slate of electors.\" Further evidence from this article (quote on quote) claims there is a \" lack of democratic pedigree.\" Electoral voting also only benefits the larger states because of there is a\u00a0 larger amount of members of the electoral college for the\u00a0 larger states.  In essence, the Electoral College is necessary for the balance and order in the United States to remain. It provides a fair representation and campaign for all regions, allows votes from states with fewer population numbers to have significance, and avoids the issue of trying to determine the president when neither receives the majority vote. This all shows that fewer problems arise when using this procedure, rather than if they use majority vote. \"You help choose your state's electors when you vote for President because when you vote for your candidate you are actually voting for your candidate's electors.\" This shows that the citizens still have power in choosing their candidate and it creates a balance with other parties. In conclusion, the Electoral College should be kept to preserve the integrity and equality the United States is all about.     The Electoral College was a compromise made by our founding fathers. It was made as a compromise between the election of a president through a vote from Congress and election through popular vote. The downside to this way of election is that the voters are not voting for one of the candidates but for their state electors, who then vote for the president. The votes from each of the states electors then count as votes for the candidate  It would be easier to simply allow presidents to get the popular vote in order to make the election more fair all around. The \"electoral college\" is unfair to voters because of the winner-take-all system.  When the Constitution of the United States was written our founding fathers decided on an Electoral College as the way to ellect the president instead of a direct vote. The Electoral College is a process that makes a compromise between the popular vote of the citizens and the Congressional vote. When citizens vote for president they are actually voting for a member of the Electoral College that is going to select their president, rather than the citizens voting for the president themselves. The Electoral College is made of 538 electors, the number of electors from each state varies depending on the states Congressional delegation. Washington D.C. is counted as a state for this process and alloted only three electors.  In conclusion, the Electoral College should be replaced by the popular vote system as soon as possible. The Electoral College relies on archaic methods to make tallying votes simpler for the government, which results in problems. It's like the government is rounding the votes. The winner-takes-all method of the Electoral College can render a voter's vote completely useless, and it even allows representatives to vote for the presidential candidate that is against the voter's wills. Presidential candidates will not bother campaigning in states that are loyal to their adversary or are too small to be worth their time. While a single person's opinion might not seem important, or rounding votes seems \"easier,\" no corners should ever be cut when deciding who the leader of a nation with over 50 million citizens is, which is why the Electoral College should be replaced by the popular vote system.     The Electoral College is a process where voters select electors who then vote for the President of the United State. But is it really that reliable? Is it better than an election decided by that of popular vote.   The Electoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment of the Senate decreed in the Constitution.\" This shows that large states can sway the whole election, while small states don't make a dent on it, without the Electoral College in place. Thus, using it allows smaller states' votes to matter in the election, while eliminating large states' advantage over them  Presidential elections provides the United States of America with an opprotunity of unification. The process of choosing the next leader of the United States always brings the people of the country together knowing that all of them play a role in the election. This is present in the popular vote, a vote consisting of the general population. However, the popular vote is not always accurate, as anyone of any background can vote as long as they hold proper citzenship. The electoral college on the other hand, is a process that serves as a compromise between Congress and the rest of America. ",

In that case, the election would be thrown to the House of Representatives, where state delegations vote on the president. \" Who wants that? What's it even worth voting then if your vote, your vote on the leader of America gets put into the hands of the House Of Representatives to decide on. Think about it.  In Source 2, paragraph 12 it states, \"Perhaps most worrying is the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote.\" This is a big worry because the electoral college holds a total of 538 votes which is definetely possible to cause a tie. If this were to happen, then the vote would be thrown to the House of Representatives where state delegations would vote on the president. Then the concept of the presidential campaigns would become pointless because the point of campaining is to try to win over large, swing states to ensure more votes. Because the bigger the states population, the more votes they hold in the electoral college. But that would only work if it was in the Senates hands because the amount of representatives in the Senate for each state is based off of population, whereas the amount of representatives in the House of Representatives is always two for each state. So if the vote was thrown into the House of Representatives hands, then whichever candidate who holds claim over the most states, regardless of size, would almost automatically win the election because each state holds equal say in their vote.  Source 2 states that if a tie happens, the election would be thrown to the House of Representatives, where state delegations vote on the president. The senate would choose the vice-president. The state delegations may not vote for the president you want and the senate may not vote for the vice-president you want either.  In this case, the election would be thrown to the House of representatives, were delegates from each state would vote on the president. Since each state has only one vote to cast, a vote from a state containing 500,000 people would carry the same weight as a vote representing the opinions of 35 million. Given that many voters vote one party for president and another for Congress, the selection made by the House of Represenatives can hardly be expected to respesent the will of the people.     In doing this you are having a fair vote in the election with everyone who is eligable to vote, voting whomever they please. If you vote for your own president of your choice there will not be any elector deciding for you if they do not like what you have elected. We need to have a say in what we want. I mean if we want someone to be watching over us, and deciding what to do, we want someone who everyine agrees on. Just a few hundred poeoplpe choosing for you is nothing compared to approximatley more than a million people choosing for themselves. In  Source 2 \"The indefensible electorial college : why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong by Bradford Plumer\"  it says that the electors can always defy the will of the people. In my case I believe that no one would want that. I mean, would you want that?  Secondly, Plumer claims \"Perhaps most worrying is the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote. In that case, the election would be thrown to the House of Representatives, where state delegations vote on the president. (The senate would choose the vice-president.) Because each state casts only one vote, the single representative from Wyoming, representing 500,000 voters, would have as much say as the 55 representatives from California, who represnt 35million voters.\" This method is rediculous.  I read an article stating that if a tie were to happen the election would be thrown to the house of representatives, where state delegations vote on the president. This would anger a heap of people for many reasons, one stating it would almost rule out their vote.  According to Source 2, the voters--the ones supposedly voting for our new president--vote for a group of electors instead. Due to the power of the Electoral Colleg, electors can vote for any candidate. This process we have every 4 years is truly un-democratic. For example, during the 2000 election, Al Gore was the candidate with the most popular votes--this meant that the majority of the citizens of the U.S. wants him to be president. However, Al Gore lost since the majority of electors from the Electoral College voted him. Lastly, in the case of a time, the lection will truly be un-democratic; the House of Representatives will have to choose the new president.  If there is a tie in the in the electoral vote \"the election would be thrown to the House of Representatives\" (paragraph 12). This is an unfair method also becasue now there's only one vote per state and some states have a higher population than others which can and will cause contreversy in the public. \"The pressure, which would greatly complicate the presidential election process, may be redcued\" (patagraph 22) but it still doesn't reduced the fact that swing voters can cause catastrophe within the electoral voting process. This is because they are the most targeted voting areas due to their reputations as the \"most thoughtful voters\".  \"Perhaps most worrying is the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote,\" says source 2. A tie in the votes, which is very much possible since the total number of votes is 538, according to source 1, could then allow the fate of America to rest in the hands of the House of Representatives, a miniscule representation of the people.

                "content": "In source two it tells us that Al Gore had won more than 60 percent of the populkar vote, but still lost the presidency because of the flaws in the Electoral system. From the knowledge that I have gained through all three of these articles, it makes no logical sense that Al Gore won the popular vote with 60 percent and still lost the presidency. All of these sources include something along the lines of, \"popular vote elects slate electors to choose president\".  According to the Gallup pole in the 2,000, taken shortly after Al Gore, thanks to the quirks of the electoral college, won the popluar vote but lost the presidency. Over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now. This is what im talking about people. People are losing their elections due to the electoral college. One of the major reasons of why people are wanting a change, there should be no electoral college, only a popular vote for the election. We all want a better Government. I only there was a better way to vote.  In paragraph nine,\u00a0 the text says, \"... according to a Gallup poll in 2000, taken shortly after Al Gore- thanks to the quirks of the electoral college- won the popular vote but lost presidency, over 60 percent of voters\u00a0 would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now.\" The electoral college is responsible for picking electors, who can go behind the peoples back and chose the president nobody wanted. This system or process is a total disaster. Paragraph thirteen states, \"At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winner-take-all system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the 'swing' states.  . From my knowledge, Under the Electoral college system, voters vote not only for the president, but for a slate of electors. \"Richard Nixon, Jimmy carter, Bob Dole, the U.S. chamber of commerce, and the AFL-CIO all, in their time agreed on getting ride of the electoral college!\" for example Al Gore won the popular vote but lost the presidency, over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now. Why dosnt the goverment just give us what we want?  if 90% of votes go to a candidate, then why would they not get the presidency? its common sense.  A presidential candidate that wins by a large majority in a state will win the electoral votes of that state, however, if another candidate wins a very close election, he/she will also win a state. For example, in the 2000 presidential election between Al Gore and President Bush, Al Gore won the popular vote of the people but lost the election for president because of the electoral college, the very fact that we know what the popular vote was is proof of neccesity of change. Not only this, but sixty percent of voters want to vote directly. This makes it possible for a candidate to have more individual votes but less electoral votes, making the system somewhat corrupt.  These People were Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and the AFL-CIO. Turned out their not the only ones according to the exerpt from \"The Indefensible Electoral College: why even the best-laid defenses are wrong.\" is sates \"They're not alone; according to a Gallup poll in 2000 taken shortly after Al Gore- thanks the quirks of the electoral college- won the popular vote but lost the presidency, over 60 percent of the voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now.\"  Stated in source 2, \" Gallup poll in 2000, taken shortly after Al Gore-thanksto the quirks of the electoral college- won the popular vote but lost the presidency, over 60 percent off voters would prefer a dirt election to the kind we have now.\" In short, people were so unhappy with the election and the way it ended. people would rather have direct voting than to continure with an Electoral college.  Third, according to the Al Gore-thanks to the quirks of the electoral college- won the popular vote but lost the presidency, over 60 percent of the voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now  As stated in an article by Bradford Plumer, \"... Al Gore ---thanks to the quirks of the electoral college---won the popular vote but lost the presidency.\" The person running for president should be voted for directly by the voters. Someone, such as Al Gore, can get enough of the popular votes, but not enough of the electoral votes becuase they can't swing the votes in some states. This basically means that the majority of the United States would like to have Al Gore as a president, but couldn't because the majority of people in a state didn't want him as president.  This was also agreed upon by many other citizens. According to a Gallup Poll in 2000, which was taken shortly after Al Gore won the popular vote, but lost the popular vote. According to the poll \"over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election not\u00a0 the kind we have now.\" It is said that \"this year voters are to expect another close election in which the popular vote winner could again loose the presidency.\" ",

                "content": "There are many reasons why someone should ask multiple people for advice including getting a more educated answer and receiving different opinions. Asking more than one person would provide someone with better advice and a variety of answers. Whether somebody asks two or five people, all of the answers that are given will lead them to make better choices.  By asking more than one person for advise on a subject, they can get more than one new idea that isn't one of their own. This way, they can get more than one person's thoughts on the decision, and have different ideas on it. For example, if someone were trying to make a decision on what sport they may want to tryout for at school, they could possibly ask their friends and family about which they should choose. However, they should also ask people like classmates and teachers, as they may have their own ideas, and won't give the person any biased ideas or information. Friends and family can have a great deal of influence on people, so it's important to always get people's thoughts that are on the outside. This will make it to where there's a greater chance of the decision maker not being biased, as they've heard numerous people's thoughts, and can make their own decision off of that.   If someone were to ask one hundred different people what their favorite food is, they would probably get 100 different answers. This can be applied to advice because, if someone were to ask several different people for advice, they could get completely different advice from different people, and, chances are, some of the advice can really help instead of giving the person that needs advice useless information floating around. For a moment, imagine that it's time to vote for the President, and person 1 has no idea of who to vote for.  So person one goes back to his/her good friend person 2, then asks, \"Person two, who are you voting for?\" Person two replies with his/her chosen candidate, and person one asks several other people, and finally, person four tells person one about the candidate that he/she has chosen, and person one also votes for that person, because from what person four said, that person will do great things as President. If person one had just asked person two who to vote for, he/she never would've known that person four had chosen the candidate that was right for person one's beliefs. Another benefit to getting multiple people's solutions is that the different advice can be applied to the same problem until something works. For example, person one is trying to fix that pesky flat tire on his/her car, and then the advice that person two and person three gave. Because person one can't get person four to help, because person four is on vacation in Norway, person one decides to apply the advice of person two and person three to see if something works, and it turns out that person two had good advice once person one figured out what person two was trying to say. Basically, multiple answers can lead to the best answer and many solutions can be applied to the same problem until something works.  When asking for an opinion you might want to ask more than one person because the person you ask might have better advice than the other person.  Asking more than one person for advice is critical. You can see what others think, receive many different opinions that are better than the others, and view your dilemma in a new perspective. After all of that, your situation could seem easier to understand and not so terrible as you thought. Asking just one person for their thoughts is a mistake, do not forget to ask another!  I mean if the majority\u00a0of people give one response it probably the correct answer. You dont to ask one person\u00a0only to find out that they're wrong. I would also advise you to ask the person why they think what they think. asking more than one person will help you better stand the problem and by doing that we can narrow it down to give the most valid response.  Sometimes we need advice, and asking one person for advice just doesn't provide you with the right advice you are in need of. When we ask more than one person it can benefit us, because each answer is so diverse and it is seen from a different perspective. When its one person, you only hear their bit of advice, and sometimes you need a little something more.   When people ask for advice, they should always seek more than one opinion because the people they ask could have different past experience, be biased, or have different opinions about the matter. When asking for an opinion in something, always ask different people and different kinds of people. People can have different opinions about things and be biased. Asking biased people for an opinion on something is never good so that is why people ask more than one individual before they make an important choice. In conclusion, this is why people need to get multiple opinions before they make a big choice.  When asking for advice, it is better to ask multiple people than to just ask one person. This is because asking more than one person leads to hearing more points of view, having more discussion about a problem, and thinking about a problem for longer. Asking one person for advice will limit a decision and it may lead to someone making a bad decision. Asking multiple people for advice can lead somebody to become more open minded about a problem, or even life in general. For these many reasons, asking multiple people for advice is the best way to find a solution to a problem or situation.  Asking numerous people can be a huge help when making an important decision. Not only are people getting different ideas of what they may want to do, they can also get advise from people who may be more experienced than themselves. For example, if someone was debating on which college they should apply to, they may end up asking people such as older siblings or parents for advise because they may have more experience with that matter. By asking multiple people, you can get multiple ideas, each of them being different in their own way. By getting more people's input, you may be able to start to make your own choice about the matter because of the advise you've gotten. ",

For example whenever I am at home doing my math homework and I am getting particularly bored with it it is very easy to \"take a quick break\". This could mean anything from a two minute glass of water or a five hour nap depending on how I am feeling. So if I took a online course I would have to face this same dilemma\u00a0with every assignment I am given.  Students in all kinds of difficult circumstances would benefit greatly from taking online classes. Students suffering from mental health issues like anxiety and depression and students with sicknesses will have the option to take online classes and they will have a schedule more accommodated to their needs. All students including students that take AP, IB, or harder level classes classes will be able to receive more hours of sleep if online classes are an option, and during a crisis students would feel much safer attending classes online from home.\u00a0  Another reason online classes are not as beneficial as they may appear is that students face constant distraction and opportunity to cheat at home than if they were in the classroom.  Taking classes online and learning from home brings unwanted distractions such as having the need to sleep, watching TV, playing games and having to take care of kids while doing class at the same time. With these distractions, students are not able to get their classes and work done, they're not able to stay focused on their task which can result in bad grades and affect one's education. This can eventually lead to depression and failure which is very sad and dangerous and needs to be taken seriously. A student may even struggle to get their grades up having to constantly deal with these distractions while juggling classes online. Video conferencing is not great and students should go to a school building and study to best eliminate any possible distractions to learn.  Having a friend who is online-schooled, who admits frequently that he has ample free time, which he wastes on playing video games and watching TV, while at the same time, students in the classroom are made to do tedious book-work, is very eye-opening to a pressing issue. Students who take classes online have more time to slack off and goof around, and for the less-disciplined child, this will reflect negatively in their grades  People who attend online school may feel like outsiders in these groups of students of which all go to the same public school. To add to the social skills provided by public schools, students even attain social skills just by showing up and interacting with their peers, teachers, and administrators. Students who are schooled online may not know what type of relationship or the nature of interactions they should have with future employers or coworkers because that is something that puclic school students practice every day without thought, therefore it is not in the curriculum for the online students to learn  At home, a student has limited resources and won't be able to receive support and feedback from teachers and classmates. If a student takes a class online, there won't be any teacher to tell him or her what and how to do the work. And so if a student is stuck on what they're supposed to do, or if they did something incorrectly, then they won't be have the chance for improvement or learn from their mistakes. Feedback is critical for a student's growth, and without a personal relationship with a teacher, there is no growth  For instance, my friend Generic_Name took the same class that I did during the school year, however, she took the course online over the summer; the class was Economics and Personal Finance. When we both were tested on the material that we learned during the course, she scored higher than I did which shocked me. In conclusion, online classes have the same material and benefits just as much as an actual classroom has and does not hinder the knowledge gained for taking the class in either way.  If a student goes to school through an online program, they will have not gotten to learn from the experience of being in a physical school, which could cause them incredible difficulties later on, such as the social aspect of life.

According to the article \"Making Mona Lisa Smile,\" there is a new technology called the Facial Action Coding System (FACS) that enables computers to identify human emotions. This technology is relatively brand new. It creates a 3-D computer model of all fourty-four major muscles in the face that move like human muscles as well. Then, psychologists have classified six basic emotions that are associated with different movements in the facial mucles. This new technology could result in many benefits in our community as well as all around the world  Every living thing on planet earth has emotions. These emotions have been used since the beginning of time to express the feelings of the people around you. However, these emotions can be decieving. Someone could say they are happy, when really they are angry or upset. This is where the Facial Action Coding System comes into play. The FACS is a software that detects human emotion by tracking muscles in the face. For example, when you are happy, muscles in your face move up, and when you are sad, they move down, FACS tracks this and calculates your emotions. The creators of this software, Prof. Thomas Huang and Prof. Nicu Sebe are the leading experts of developing better ways for humans and computers to communicate. There are still some questions surrounding the usefulness of FACS, like what could this software actually be used for? One of the ways FACS may be used is in classrooms.  There's a new kind of technology called Facial Action Coding System, or FACS, which enables computers to identify human emotions. The use of this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is very valuable  In almost all class rooms nation wide there is a similar routine. Learn something, practice it for homework and then see if a student is understanding it by taking a quiz over it. While this may be effective, it can be imporved ten fold with the Facial Action Coding System. The technology could understand emotion of students in present time. A teacher wouldn't have to wait to give out a quiz to see if students were having issues. They could teach the subject and then immediatly know if students are having difficulty unerstanding it. Dr. Huang, the creator of FACS, states that \"A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored\". If teachers are able to recieve this information, their teaching would become more effective. Teachers could change lesson plans in order to fit the needs of the students, and give extra support and help to those children that are still struggling. FACS can also help excite studnets about learning. This is important because no matter how much a teacher trys to help a student, the studnet will not imporve in anything if thet do not want to learn. If computers are able to read if studnets are excited or bored by a lesson, teachers would add visuals and what not to make it more intersesting to a student. This would make them want to learn, not them being required to learn. totality, the ability to be able to percieve students emotions would help students academically by allowing teachers to change lesson plans that allow for more excitment and understand in classrooms.  The highly inteliigent Facial Action Coding System a valuable asset for students in a classroom, as it fosters an enjoyable and captivating learning environment that will shape the students' commitment to school. This advanced software analyzes the movement of a human's facial muscles, comparing it to an emotionless one, and determines the percent distribution their feelings. This innovative software provides students with the ability to customize the pages and lessons on the computer, giving them control over their method of learning. Students with this ability will feel captivated by their learning, as they are in control and can decide how they learn. The development of a desire to learn is crucial for school-aged children so that in the future, they will continue on to further educate themselves and expand their knowledge. This facial  -analysis technology provides schools with the ability to create a captivating learning environment for students that will motivate them to stay committed to their education and reach their goals. While this new technology provides a bounty of benefits to many, assisting students in the achievement of their hopes and dreams holds the most value.  Have you ever been bored in a class room such as your highschool english classes? Well do to a brand new algorithum made by Dr. Paull Eckman, creator of the FACS(Facial Action Coding System), you can finaly be exited about learning about greek and latin roots. This program can detect how you are felling and in what precentages  The recent innovation of FACS (Facial Action Coding System) can be utilized by schools to vastly improve the way children are educated.  In conclusion, The use of FACS in a classroom enviroment sounds like a great idea but when you put it in different catagories it fails in almost every one of them you dont need a computer to read emotions when a human is perfectly capable of know how you feel even if it is just a little bit. The schools will need more funding diverted to even run the program and keep it working when schools already have a budget that they have to work on and they will need to be prepared to do something if the power goes out because that system will not run if it has incffecient power.  New technology is being introduced to mankind almost every second in this world, and now, the latest techonology is a computer program called the Facial Action Coding System which can identify a person's emotions. The question is whether this technology is actually valuable and for what it could be used for. Experts suggest this technology could be used in a classroom to identify the state of mind of a student to adjust the lesson they are trying to comprehend. But, even though this technology may be helpful to teachers trying to keep students active and engrossed in their lessons, the question arises of whether this techonlogy is actually worth the recources or whether what experts think is a great idea is actually an invasion of privacy.

The belief that the mesa is actually a face is inncorect due to evidence in the article and my essay. Mesa's are common in the area the picture was taken and the face was caused by shadows along with a low quality camera. Whichever side you are on I believe I have brought forth enough evidence to change your opinion or strengthen your opionion that there was no alien lifeforms yet found on Mars.  Contrary to popular belief, there is nothing unatural about the supposed \"Face on Mars\". Though many would like to believe in the supernatural, this oddity is nothing but a rock formation. There are several reasons as to why the theory of aliens making this formation is preposterous, each reason stronger than the previous.  Even thoug hmy colleague still believes in the \"Face on Mars\" to be a alien made structure. I still believe it's only a butte or mesa. With my evindence of the \"Face on Mars\" only looking like a face due to the techonology of the time, the shadows of the sun, the angle the picture was taken, and our ability to see faces when none are there, I believe I have conclusive evidence that the \"Face on Mars is nothing but a butte or mesa.  In paragraph 12, Garvin said, \" It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about thye sane height as the Face on Mars.\" Jim Garvin is saying that these formations on Mars are very similar to the ones that we have here on Earth. He is also saying that there os no face on Mars.  With very high resolutioned photos, it is hard for conspiracy theorists to still say that there is face on Mars. It even says in paragraph 11,\" So if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!\"  In recent years many citicens have stated that the so called \"face on mars\" is a martion monument. Well I have but one question for those few citicens. Do you have any proof?  It does look like it could be from another living organism, but it's just a rock on the planet. In our newest image of the rock, it turns out that the face has dissapered. There is no evidence of this being created by aliens, rather it was created by wind and water that has been found on Mars. The reason you might believe that this was indeed aliens, might be the fact that the news has blown it out of poportion. It's just the rock that had some interesting shadows and holes that made it look like a human face.  Are you ready to accept the truth about the Face on Mars? I have listed valid, credible arguments including the high resolution of the 2001 photo, and the weak resolution of the 1976 photo. I also questioned the logic of extra-terrestrial life, and the logic that NASA would have used to cope with the discovery of aliens.  NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft has found something while circling  Mars. But what is it, they have seem to have found a face formed into the rocks. Is this new discovery actually a face or is it just another rock formation.  The believers and the non-believers of the face on Mars are waiting anxiously to find out what it is. Is it a rock formation or is it an actual human face, no one knows  In 1976 the face looked like a face. In 1998 it started to not look like a face at all. In 2001 it just looked like a rock. So i believe that it was not created by aliens but that it was just something the olanet had made itself. This has certainly got the attention of the people.  The \"Face on Mars\" is not a face. If you look at the pictures from 1976, and 1998, and 2001 and in the text it says that the photo from 2001 is the most recent photo that NASA has. It still looks nothing like a face so since the 2001 picture is the most recent it shows that it is just a natural landform. It is just a natural landform. On Mars there are natural landforms everywhere and the fade away. Here on earth natural landforms are created everyday. ",

In the passage, \"The Challenge of Exploring Venus,\" the author explains the different reasons as to why Earth, as a whole, should further study the planet of Venus, alotting all its difficulties.  The author of \"The Challenge of Exploring Venus\", uses many scientific facts, data, and explanations to support their idea of exploring Venus. In the passage, many examples are given of why scientists would want to explore the possibilities of the contents of Venus despite all the dangers.  There are many dangers that come along with studying planets. Along with the dangers, there are also countless benefits to learning more about different planets. In the passage, \"The Challenge of Exploring Venus\", the author addresses the point that Venus is worth taking a closer look at and focusing on, no matter the dangers it could put one in.  The author supports their claim by giving numerous details and supporting his ideas.\"Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endbeavors.\" A big issue that is brought up are the harsh conditions Venus brings. \"On the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Farenheight, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet.\" Knowing this, you might think that they must stop there with their research because there's no way they can discover Venus now because it's to dangerous and harsh. That is false, \"NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray.\" Their solution is to have a vehicle hovering over Venus that would avoid the unfriendly ground conditions by staying up and out of their way. It would still be toasty but not deathly. The author claims, \" Not easy conditions, but survivable for humans.\" The author supports his claim by saying yes, the temperature is a challenge they will face, but NASA has one particular compelling idea for sending humans to study Venus, and they will continue to challenge themselves and find solutions to these conflicts they face.  In Paragraph 8, the author claims, \"Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiousity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors.\" The author brought up the word \"challenge\" again,  For example, \"Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors\" (The Challenge 8). This evidence is only given in the last paragraph of the article and is not mentioned anywhere else. Also, the author lists many of the dangers of traveling to Venus, but does not dictate why it is worth the risk of exploring the planet.  In \"The Challenge of Exploring Venus,\" the author provides a compelling and efficient argument to support the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers. Using statistics, factual information, and specific plans being developed as we speak, the author convinces the audience that exploring Venus is worth the risks involved.  In \"The Challenge of Exploring Venus\", the author argues the point that exploring Venus is worth the effort and risks exhibited. The author claims that, despite the harsh conditions and deadly atmosphere, this planet is worth travelling to and observing, due to its being the \"nearest option for a planetary visit\".  In \" The Challenge of Exploring Venus\", the author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit because Venus is interesting, helpful, and it is safe  In \"The Challenge of Exploring Venus,\" the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents is supported through Venus' vast similarities to Earth, Venus' proximity to Earth, and the innovation in machines by researchers that could make them work long enough to expand mankind's knowledge on Venus. The idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers is supported through Venus' vast similarites to Earth, which is why humans have such interest in this particular planet. The idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the presented dangers is conveyed through Venus' proximity. The idea that Venus is a worthy pursuit despite its hostile environment is supported through the innovation in machines that could make the close-up exploration of Venus possible. The author believes that sometimes humans cannot let curiosity, imagination, and innovation be trampled by the dangers and doubts. Humans cannot live in fear all the time. The human spirit always demands that humans continue striving towards knowing more.   ",

The Electoral College is an old compromise the was made by the founding fathers, but some changes have to be made to fit the modern times and ways  In summation, the Electoral College has been around for hundreds of years, but it is time that the United States makes the change that would improve the way of electing its future Presidents. The Electoral College is outdated and complicated, does not allow the voice of the people to be heard, and leads to uneccessary voting complications. For these reasons, I vehemently feel that we should switch from the Electoral College to election by popular vote.       \u00a0  Though I have not been alive to see most of it, I am sure that the debate on keeping the Electoral College or changing to election by popular vote has been going on for ages. Now, the words of a fourteen year old might not mean much to a state senator, especially since it will be four years until I am legally allowed to vote, but please sir, hear me out  The Electoral College was a smart idea in the seventeen and eighteen hundreds, but as our country continues to change, it is necessary to change the way that we elect our leaders. The Electoral College has remained untouched and exactly the same for hundreds of years and this has caused it to be extremely outdated.  The Electoral College was created with good intentions, but it has many vital flaws which allow for very unfair outcomes. The electoral college is an outdated, and irrational way to choose the president of our country for the next four years  \"The Electoral College is unfair, outdated, and irrational.\"(Plumer, The Indefensible Electoral College) It says it all, when the Founding Fathers made the Electoral college, the country was a lot smaller than it is today. The Electoral College was needed because there was a chance that the election could be tied. Today, the country is huge. The chance of a tie 1 in a trillion chance. I feel that we should give it a try, and abolish the College. This nation stands by freedom, and voting should be a choice.     The Electoral College is a method of voting for President and Vice President that was produced by our founding fathers in the articles of the Constitution. The Electoral College has been in use for centuries, but it is time that we disregard it.  Most people hear the word \"Electoral College\" and think that it is a place.. But they're wrong, it is a process. The Electoral College is widely regarded as a thing that seems to belong to the past and not to fit in the present. The advocates whom are conflicting with others are saying that the Electoral College method isn't democratic in modern day society, which is correct. The Electoral College is a compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens which was founded by the founding fathers.  The Electoral College is a process put into place by the founding fathers for the purpose of electing a president. However, this process was enacted at the very beginning of the United States and the question must be asked, Is it still neccessary? Or even fair? ",

Even though electors votes it can lead to more of an unoraginized distaster. it can mainly lead to a lot of confusion and miss counts. a lot of people do not like the fact of electors being one just like the presidnet of untied states.  The article \"The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong\" written by Bradford Plumer states, \"The single best argument against the electoral college is what we might call the disaster factor. The American people should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century; the sytem allows for much worse. Consider that state legislators are technically responsible for picking electors, and that those electors could always defy the will of the people\". This means that the people never know if their electors are going to go back on their word and vote for another candidate.  To conclude, the Electoral College has caused many disastorous factors in our presidential campaigns. It has caused the wrong president to be elected, and it doesn't give our citizens much of a voice in the election. However, changing the system to popular vote for the president will give people a louder voice in this nation and it will show them that the government cares about their opinion. As the article, \"The Indefesible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid out defenses are wrong\" written by Bradford Plumer states, \"It's officual: The Electoral College is unfaor, outdated, and irrational. The best arguments in favor of it are mostly assertions without much basis in reality. And the arguents against direct elections are spurious at best.  \"The single best arguement against the electoral college is what we migh call the disaster factor.  In source two, Bradford Plumer mentions the single best argument against the Electoral College, which he calls the \"disaster factor\".  In conclusion, the electoral college is ineffective and outdated. we should no longer use this as a system of defining our president. Even though a winner is often more clear, there is still a possibility of a tie between candidates. People who support the Electoral College also argue that its a good thing due to swing states having more attention payed to them and therefore being more careful in their decision. However, this reasoning is flawed in that it assumes that citizens of a state are more likely to inform theirselves thouroughly simply because their vote holds more value, in a sense. Also, candidates would no longer pay special attention to swing states if the electoral college weren't in place so the votes of these citizens wouldn't be held above the rest. Increased value of votes is not a good thing, which this argument also assume. It is the best decision to abolish the Electoral College.    No system is perfect, and the Electoral College is not exempt from this. \"The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong\", Source 2, argues that a term called 'disaster factor', or the possibility of immenent disaster due to the Electoral College system, is why the Electoral College system should be abolished  In conculsion, \"It's offical: The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. The best arguments in favor of it are mostly aserations without much basis in reality\", according to Source 2.  I would like you to consider all the problems our nation is facing due to the Electoral College. I have stated two contentions of why you should abolish the Electoral College; First,the method of how its done is very bias and unfair and secondly, because the Electoral College is a \"Disaster Factor\" or  causes many disruptions in our country.  There is a lot contraversy regarding the Electoral College system of voting in the United States. Some voting members would argue that the system, although flawed, has yet to make a monumental mistake, and say that the minor issues were resolved or at the very least barely effective in the overall outcome of the capmaign. However, with the flaws and holes in the system we have alerady experienced, there is bound to be many more mistakes, and it would be shocking to very few that some of those mistakes are catastrophic  In many cases there is two sides to an arguement. When there is two sides to an arguement it could go either way. In this case the arguement is about the electoral college. What is the electoral college,it is the the process, not a place. The founding fathers established it in the consitution as a compromise between election of president by a vote in congress and election of presidentby popular vote of qualilfied citizens.(stated in paragraph 1) ",

Run-off elections are when no canidate receives a majority of the votes cast.  \" The electoral college avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate recevies a majority of the votes cast.  It only makes sense that the larger states with a larger population should get more of a say in their government, and recieve more electoral votes than a small state with fewer people. With this system political infulence is restored to the larger states making the canidates focuss on the more populous areas. More power to the more populous states also means that run-off elections are avoided. In 1992 and in 1968 run-off elections were avoided due to the use of the Electoral College; \"Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992 both had only a 43 percent plurality of the popular votes, while winning a majority of the Electoral College\" P.22. A run-off election extreamly complicates the election process however the chance of this happening is greatly reduced when using the Electoral College which almost always produces a clear winner.  They avoid the problems in the election which no candidate recieves a majoriy of the votes cast. For example, Nixion and Clinton both had 43 percent plurality of popular votes. There is pressure for run-off elections when no candidate wins a majority vote, that pressure greatly complicates the presidential process.  Altough many downfalls, \"The Electorial College restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states... lose\" and \"avoids the problem of elections in which no one recieves a majority of the votes cast,\"(Source Three, paragragh 21 and 22).  The electoral college allowed some of are greatest presidents to win beacuse if they got more electoral votes then popular vote it would'nt matter they will still win. The electoral college also avoids the problem of one candidate not recieving the majority of the votes cast. The electoral college has been in are country for so long and has worked for us well but I still believe that the popular vote can be and\u00a0 should be used in future elections  Electoral College believers think that having electors go on either side to let one canidate win, is right. \"Knowing their vote will have no effect, they have less incentive to pay attention to the campaign than they would have if the president were picked by popular vote..\"(Posner). So these Electoral College followers agree with the electors actually selecting the winner because they don't have to do anything. People can just sit back and watch the electors take the power, while the others do nothing but be slumps. In source one, the Office of the Federal Register mention that \"when you vote for your candidate you are actually voting for your candidate's electors.\", which means that if voters have friends in the position of an elector, voters might just vote for the elector because theres nothing else to really pay attention to.  The Electoral College is widely regarded as an anachronism, a non-democratic method of selecting a president that needs to be overruled by declaring the canidate who receives the most popular votes the winner. I personally think that is the best way to decide who gets in.  Some might argue that the Electoral College is flawed because electors can choose not to vote for their canidate.

The teachers would be able to assign projects that are relevant to their lesson, relating their summer work to the unit they will be studying first, allowing them to be able to start learning as soon as they get back to school. During the months of summer break, the last thing that students want is the stress of a project. It would be much easier and less stressful if the teachers designed the project to reduce the amount of preparation needed from the students. The teachers would give the students clear guidelines, and then be able to help the students because they have a distinct idea of what they are looking for. Summer projects should be teacher-designed to insure the relevancy of the project, guarantee structured guidelines, and limit the unnecessary stress for students.\u00a0  Teacher-designed projects are the best way for schools to ensure that students continue learning material for classes during break without causing anxiety in students or misjudgment of students by teachers. Summer projects are meant to help students but student-designed projects can sometimes harm students instead. Every student should be allowed to spend their summer without stressing about how they will be perceived by their fellow classmates and teachers the next year. Summer projects should encourage students to continue to learning while also spending quality time with their family and friends during their break.  Over summer break, many students just want to be able to relax and not do work that they may have little interest in that has been assigned by their teacher. By having student-driven projects, it gives students an opportunity to create something that they are passionate about. This is important because when a student is passionate about what they are working on, it creates motivation for them to complete the assignment. A student is highly likely to complete an assignment that they are involved in because it is relative to their life. Many projects that are handed around by teachers have little to no relevance to the lives of students. If students get the opportunity to create their own assignment, they will feel a sense of pride because they are passionate about the topic. This leads to greater motivation internally for any student which leads to better overall results.  Most schools require students to complete a variety of projects during their summer break like reading books or completing a math packet. These projects help students continue their learning away from school, except the only difference is that they have all of summer to do it compared to having a due date within a week. Some projects prepare students for the upcoming school year while others act like reminders so that students won't forget what they learned in the past year. Though some believe that summer projects should be student-designed, others will argue that summer projects should be teacher-designed in order to get the best learning experience while away from school.  Many schools made the smart decision of requiring a summer project to make sure that their students are learning over a long break, as students who do not exercise their brain over the summer are known to have less knowledge when returning from the break. If schools started giving out the option of students being able to design these projects instead of the teachers, the beneficial aspects of the summer project would start to dissipate.  Students often moan and groan about summer projects that their teachers assign them to do over summer break to assure they continue learning over the period they are not in school. The projects most of the time, have a set rule book to follow that was issued by the teacher and it makes the project boring and not enjoyable for the students to do, basically being a burden the students have to over come during their relaxing summer break.  Although the project is intended for the continuation of learning, students are more likely to design their projects to be as simple as possible. Given the circumstance of it being summer and having to complete a project which is under their observation, students will do the bare minimum amount of work. The same cannot be said if it was created by a teacher. In addition, students are more likely to complete the project solely for the grade rather than the learning experience; defeating the whole purpose of assigning a summer project.  It is very usual for school systems to assign students with a project over summer break. It is common for this project to be a long grueling book report or an assignment to research some far off place or historical happenstance that took place hundreds of years ago. These projects are often neglected by students till the end of summer due to them not enjoying or wanting to do the project ",

                "content": "For example , we need to forces on more important things such as school work and maybe after school activates. I think we shouldn't be able to have our phones because 50% of students that have cell phones fail there classes because while the teacher is explaining something important the student us either messing around or texting another student which is not only affecting he/she but others around them.  Just think about it, if students aren't able to use their phones in school at all then they will use it no matter what the case is because they feel the urge to do it. They will feel the need to do it because either they receive text that will make them want to reply back or they become so obsessed with using them that they think that they have to use it.  Whether it's due to weather, illness, or anything else, plans often get changed in the blink of an eye. If the students don't have cell phones, the administration of the school has to coordinate plans and arrange for a student to have a ride home. With everything else the administration has to do, this seems like a foolish way of doing things. If students had cell phones, each student could individually arrange when and where to have their ride pick them up.  Students may feel they are being rewarded with a little free time by having their cell phones out. If this opportunity is given 99% of students may do better in school. Many may think this just gives students a way to have their cell phones out without getting in trouble for it. However, students are actually very responsible and may do the right thing.  For example if we could have our cell phones out nobody would be thinking of the lesson or would even bother to tune into the class because obviously a phone is a perfect way to chat with your friends while the teacher isn't looking. This makes it difficult for the person sending the messages AND the one receiving them because both are having their attention pulled away from what's important (class) and what's not (socializing). Another example is even if the rule says that cell phones can only be used during free time students will be using them all the time ignoring the rule. Honestly anybody can quickly put the phone under the table and text a quick message to their friend but in that short second the teacher could've been explaining something crucial to the development of the students skills. And just missing that one little thought the student is now behind because of it. As you can see cell phones will be a major disruption to the students if allowed for them to have them in school.  First of all, if students have cell phones then they will be tempted to use it and might get in trouble if they use it in class secretly because they are not allowed to use them in school  If students do use their cell phones, they will not be paying attention to the teacher or what they need to know. Without the second policy, students' grades will drop lower and lower because they are not learning what they need to. This is just one more reason why the only way to go is to ban phones in schools at all times.  Lastly, you wont have teachers complaining about their students not paying attention in class due to the fact that the students are always on their cell phones. Most teachers have to stop the lesson because they have to waste their time taking students cell phones away.  Imagine a student doing his work, and suddenly he doesn't know the answer to a problem. Fortunately, he has his cell phone in his pocket, and can look up the answer on the internet. If cell phones are allowed during class, students can easily get information of the web, without doing to work nessacery.  During tests, students can send messages back and forth on what the answers are, and the teacher would never know. This is a problem, because students who are caught cheating can end up in serious trouble.  Over all, I believe that banning phones from school is a bad idea. None of the students would follow the rule, and they would just bring them to school and hide them. This will get zero progress, and will create no change in the school environment. If you let students text during free time, it could keep students from texting during class, and help them focus more. By distracting the students while they are outside or have free time, it could prevent them from doing something to get them in trouble. And less people would be angry. You would not have angry students or parents coming up to the school to take back a confiscated item, thus not having to bother with any angry people. This is where I stand on the policies, but the final decision is up to you. ",

                "content": "This completely opens up your mind to may ways to go about this. You are no longer stuck to just your own point of view. This can also get you to act on your problem in a more creative way. This happens because when you are opened up to so many points of view it lets you be basically unrestricted in problem solving ideas. One other thing that goes along with this advantage is that you could lead to an invention. Inventions are just ways to get around a problem in life. When we receive multiple points of view like this is opens up our creativity and problem solving to a wider array of options. One of those options could be something totally new, which would be an invention. Receiving multiple points of view and a wider range of ideas is in my opinion the best part of getting advice from more than one person. That is because it can lead to so many good ways of fixing your problem and opening up your mind to realize new ways of solving your issue.  \u00a8Originally, many futurist believed the key to developing self-driving cars someday was not so much smarter cars as roads\u00a8(3). This idea would help solve many problems that come along with the diverless car, but therfore would cause a great problem of its own. These smart roads would be highly expensive and the only way to pay for them would be the peoples money, and that seems almost impractical. These smart roads used electrical cables and magnets to help guide the car down the road, and with these ideas you would be putting the power into the roads not the cars. And with that these driverless cars would be much saver for everyone. But these roads could never be used for that they would take way too much money to be instaled, saying that driverless cars still remain unsafe.  These basic forms of work require no fragile electronics at all. Using gears, levers, pulleys, and ramrods, corporations have been able to create many devices. When made out of an acid-resistent substance that can withstand high pressure, a mechanical machine may work. The only problem with a mechanical machine is that once on the planet, sure it can do work, but it would be unable to transmit and data findings back to a receiver on a ship or earth. There would be a point where some sort of electronics would be needed. And as of right now, there is not an effective enough invention that could put humans on Venus to live and research.  Within the past decade, humans have watched in awe as technology has improved exponentially, and learned to take on tasks once thought only humans could accomplish. Technology has been taught to communicate, entertain, solve problems, along with many other functions, and now it may be able to teach as well.  Today, many humans own and operate cell phones on a daily basis. The introduction of the modern-day cell phone has made life easier. The cell phone has improved communication between individuals despite the distance. Cell phones have also made receiving information easier for the user when lacking understanding on a certain subject. In other words, the invention has made life more convenient, which resulted in dependence on the object. However, there must be a limitation to the usage of the object, especially when using the cell phone at that time can be life threatening. One of the many times that a cell phone should not be operated is while driving.  Driverless cars could be the way of the future or end up being the worst invention humans have ever fabricated. Driverless cars is a very good idea that could change the world for good. Even though there are some dangers, with research and time, these dangers could be eliminated for good  Today, technology is rapidly advancing virtually everywhere. The iPhone, electric cars, large appliances, and many more useful new technological inventions have improved and helped assist everyone with their everyday tasks in a quick and resourceful manner. The new technology of the modern world is in workplaces, homes, and best of all, schools. Technology in school has rapidly increased especially as every student at Generic_School now has their own laptop for their own educational use. Now every student can get their work done through a computer at school, but not every student or teacher prefers it. Therefore, today, some schools offer distance learning for students to attend classes from home by way of online testing and course learning on their own. Many students and especially parents are skeptical of these online distance courses because they think that the old fashioned way of staying in school and using paper and pencil is the optimal way of learning. On the other hand, many people think otherwise, so this has become a great debate in the system of education for many counties and individual schools.  Younger generations of people in our modern world are becoming increasingly attuned to smart technology,with developments such as the smartphone, smart watch, etc. spreading throughout the nation. The introduction of a driverless car would further stimulate this already existing dependency, which could lead to problems down the road.  Why is the world the way it is? Is it this way because one person had one idea that the rest of the world followed or is it this way because multiple people have collaborated and asked for advice overtime? Throughout history many people have come together and shared ideas that have changed the world. For example, many scientists have invented things like the microscope and the space shuttle, and these inventions were created through a few people coming up with one idea and then asking for more opinions and advice from others. Because these incredible scientists worked together, we have these inventions in today's\u00a0world.  To this day auto makers are continuing their work on the assuption that problems ahead will be solved and as a member of the future I look foward to those soutions and the positive changes it may bring and I want to be able share progress stories one day of how far we have come.

                "content": "Technology, in some areas, does not work every day and sometimes cannot be used at all.  At Generic_School, there are countless days when the the internet is completely down and no electronic devices can be used.  Teachers who have planned to use technology for their lesson have to come up with something different to do, with no preparation time, which leads to misusing class time at the fault of the technology errors.  If a teacher assigns work over a weekend, while the school can provide a laptop, they cannot provide wifi and internet connection in the homes of their students.  Many students do not have the funds to pay for wifi and are not able to drive to a library to connect to the internet.  Even if a student has technology, there is always a large chance their technology might not work.  This is not the fault of the student and they should not be penalized for it.  Technology caused student to be more stressed and worried bout whether or not their assignment will upload on time, or if a lesson will load and play, and it is not necessary.  Technology is not practical or easily accessible for many students.   So yes, this technology is very vaulable to the education of millions of students around the world who don't fully grasp their teachers learning methods or are just confused.  In reality, this technology continues to prove its many values, and it's evergrowing amount of benifits that completly overpower all the ideas that some may think its unnimportant.  As science is an ever-budding field by it's own nature, there is no reason that a new technology wouldn't thrive among those interested in both science and technology.  I believe this type of technology is very useful and will be beneficial to children around the globe  Firstly, the internet and modern technology's first purpose is to make our lives better.  This highly advanced technology is able to serve a multitiude of purposes that will foster an improved learning environment for students.  An example of this can be observed on a daily basis: with the simple accessibility of smart phones, it is now engraved in our culture that using technology to opt out of social situations is acceptable and more commonplace than ever before. This is because our long-term\u00a0un-moderated exposure to technology and its tendency to distract us from meaningful relationships with the people around us, is used as an excuse to limit our own social development. As a technologically-dependent and ever-evolving 21st century society, it would be unrealistic to propose that we halt the development of new technology as a means to preserve basic human interaction. Because these social habits are nearly irreversible on a global scale, an isolated, 100% digitized school environment would only promote the social debilitation of today's adolescent student body.  This technology is valuable to both teachers and students equally. The teachers are able to improve their teaching techniques and the students understand more in school. This technology, however, is nowhere near done. This technology can be further improved in many aspects. I could keep improving and always creating a smarter version of the present day technology, that may one day, change the course of education forever. This could be implemented in the online schools to understand if a student comprehends the information the value of this is unspeakable and should be institued in classrooms globally.       Technology has been used for decades in education, from the basic computer to smart boards technology has been commonly used to improve the learning capabilities of students in modern times. The 'Facial Action Coding System'  technology has the ability to help professors and teachers around the world get more into the minds of their students and engage the students into a classroom where learning is not a unified thing, but more customized and free depending on student ability.

This can be the case for school councelors and the children they are meeting with. FACS may be able to help.  Truthfully it is just another way to tell someone no to doing this or that or it is a continuation of limiting people on their creativity. Back in 6th grade most people had a problem with the art tecaher because she had such strict rules in a way it was either her way or the highway. No one could really understand why she had us doing things this way or that way. With that being said everyone was hoping that one day she would actually miss a day and one day she called out but then I looked around me everyone was having a fun time because they could express themselves through their art. All students need to be able to express themselves without having someone telling them that they are doing things wrong.  My phone buzzed with his name appearing at the top. God, I don't wanna talk to you right now, take a hint man. My boyfriend and I had just had a huge fight and I'm texting my friend Generic_Name for advice. After explaining her opinion she says to listen to other peoples advice then decide what to do.  When faced with an issue normally our first reaction is to try to solve it on our own, although most of the time our head is way up in the clouds and we need another person to drag us back to the reality of the issue. Although most times, you need a few more than just that one person to help you make the correct choice.  For example, a classmate named Generic_Name and I are having problems between ourselves. I do not know whether to apologize or to let the freindship die off. I ask ten people in my class about their opinion on Generic_Name. Nine out of the ten people think that Generic_Name has a very self loathing and snippy personality. They also say that he often does not care about his friends and only does things that please himself.  Because I asked my fellow classmates, I now have a sense of Generic_Name's personality traits. The majority of my classmates did not like Generic_Name very much. Mrs. Generic_Name, my math teacher, often gets mad at Generic_Name and sends him home with misbehavior notes for his parents to read. I now know that Generic_Name is not a very nice person and is prone to getting into trouble. Based on what I have heard from others and what I have learned in class about Generic_Name, I have come to the conclusion that it would not be a wise decision to become friends with Generic_Name again. Becoming friends with Generic_Name would set me up for failure. I would fall under the influence of Generic_Name and most likely get myself into trouble.  There are some people that can't be in a crowed of people because it causes them to get anxious.  Humans can often acknowledge how they are feeling, but the acknowledgement itself does not allow them to feel better. As stated in the article, \"They even indicate the difference between a genuine smile and a forced one\" (D'Alto 7). This line states that the lab partner will be able to tell a difference netween a genuine and meaningful smile from a harshly forced smile. There is a difference between the two because smiling will not make you happy although it is a happy gesture. The machine informing someone that they need to smile will not actually change the emotions of that person. Politicians and celebrities are major culprits of this action. They often smile as they are told to do, but they are not always genuine. They are typically hiding something from their spectators such as when they are not being truthful (D'Alto 8). Just because famous people smile when talking or looking at their audience does not change whether or not they are happy individuals. If humans themselves are unable to change their emotions when they can detect that something is wrong, then machines will be unable to do that also. Although it can give people a precise measurement of their emotions, it will not change how they feel. Therefore, investing in this system would be extremely useless and wasteful.  Image this, Your a person who doesn't really get out much, you don't talk to that many people, and you just generally keep to yourself. Now, think about this next question I'm going to ask you. If you were like that, would you be jumping out of your seat to do an extracurricular activity? If you were in this position, you would most likely say no. For some people, they need someone to help them take that step, and get out their and meet new people  Sometimes to recieve good advice, it is all in who you ask, because maybe asking people your age or younger may not be the right people to ask but older people may be the right ones, and vise versa. Here is a good example of asking one person versus many people for advice. When trasforming from child teen, we need advice about what's happening and what to do and what not to do. In this case older people would be the people to ask, because they have been through it and they probably have made the same mistakes as you, therefore that would be their expertise. For younger people you could ask advice on what clothes to pick for school and other easier things that they'd be better at advising you with.  That one student who was kicked out of the team because she didn't have the grade B average to play on the sports team is now not accepted by any of her usual friends. She is sad and may become depressed. She used to have so many friends and now she has barely any. They all want to be friends with that new girl, who can maintain the right grade average and can play on the school sports team. Now the old girl feels lonely, no one should ever have to feel lonely because of a grade that kicked them off of the team. That is not the right kind. In a school teachers and principals should aim to have all of their students happy and fulfilled, mostly.  my sister is in college, and she is taking a social development class. Believe it or not, she learned about the difficulties of confrontation with the opposite gender. In that class, she learned about what not to do when you are talking to a male or female. Which means she knows a lot more about my question then my grandma. My grandma hasn't been out on a date in forty-five years. As a result, she isn't the best person to give advice about talking to boys. In the end, if you want a good answer to a question you have, you should go to multiple people who can help you. ",

Granted, students must keep up with their school work, but level of book smarts does not effect the qualities for sports or other activities.  If students are not focusing on their work and only on sports and other extra activities, then they are defeating the purpose of school.  Students who have a grade average of a C should focus more on learning in school before they worry about playing sports or joining other clubs at the school.  If the policy was changed so that students could only participate in sports or other activities if they had a grade average of a B or higher, then you would insure that they were coming to school and learning and staying on track to becoming successful later in their lives, not just coming to school to play sports or participate in extra-curricular activities.  Although all students could possibly find something they're interested in when it comes to after school activities, such as clubs or sports,  I understand that one believes that by not allowing students to participate in sports or other activities will limit their focus to school work, therefore allowing more time towards education  When students do outdoor activities or school activities it can help them keep things off their minds like, problems at home,in school or in certain places outside.  On the other hand, the activity does not have to be very long nor everyday and it could even be during school at the end of the day. For example, Timmy Lung from the Board of Supervisors argues \"When people thing about activities they think after school, but that is not the case. Activities can be during any time of the school day.\" I agree with that, when we do Clubs at BRMS we do them at the end of the day. That way kids can go home and go and do homework and have time for their other sport. I know that if we had extracurricular activities after school then it would be hard for me because I have other sports to do and lots of homework on top of that.   Most students spend their time playing video games, or on the computer, or even watching television, and soon enough, it will become daily activities possibly for the rest of their lives. Kids can break away from the electronics and be outside getting fresh air in their systems. They could even meet new friends.  Now that the student has a hobby, that student will most likely spend time doing that hobby instead of doing the other activities that keep the student from being productive. The student will now think that if he gives something new a try, they will enjoy whatever it the new activity is. Now he will want to do other new activities that exercise either his body or his mind. Soon his free time will be filled with the hobbies that are good for him and not the time wasting ones.  Because students are on vocations, this is their time to get caught up on their favorite hobbies and fun activities with their friends and one last thing they would want to think about is doing some sort of homework during their free relaxing time with family and friends moreover on a summer morning. For instance, lets say a student wants to hang out with friends on a saturday evening, but they remember they have a whole packet of work that was assigned to them before summer vocation and that by the end of summer before school starts, they have to finish it. The student will most liekly be worried and concerned about getting it over with and that means they will either cancell hanging out with friends and stay home doing random summer assigned homework on a saturday, but this is not the case when you know you are working with you teacher and that they will be able to walk you through all the work. Students surely worry less when they are working with a teacher on summer projects hence them doing something fun and relaxing in their free time sinc their teacher is available at any given point. School related projects or assignments are more easier to handle when your teacher is always there to work with you on that specific assigned assignment. As a result, students are much likely to enjoy their time away from school without anything bothering them for whatsoever case. Since students have already endured and served their time on the previous school year, they do not need any kind of aspect worrying them to the point where they have to stay home rather than them having fun and enjoying themselves and having a good time on a summer beach day while having fresh air and cooling off. Therefore, summer projects should be teacher-designed since students are not getting overwhelmed with what they need complete, but rather having some fun time with their friends and telling jokes and laughing them off with their relatives and maybe their pets who knows.  Also students shouldn't have to perform community service because they might have other activities, clubs, groups or sport related things happening after school. ",

                "content": "By this the number is much smaller since each country is weighed and is worth certain points and decided by electors you choosed to trust to vote for the same president you did. You still are in control just that you choose somebody he/her is not likely to change his or her mind and vote for the exact person you want he or she to vote for. It stated in the article that \"Each candidate running for president in your state has his or her own group of electors. The electors are generally chosen by the candiate's politcal party.\" I say that if the candidate political party chooses the electors then they must be good and the party must be sure the elector won't change his mind out of no where.  As said in the article, \"What Is The Electoral College?\", \"The Electoral College process consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for President and Vice President, and the counting of the electoral votes by Congress.\" That is a huge amount of work but that is what keeps the elections well organized. Each candidate running for President in a state has their own group of electors. After each election, the governor of your state prepares a certificate presenting all of the candidates that ran for your state. As stated in the article by the Office of the Federal Register, \"The Certificate of Ascertainment also declares the winning presidential candidate in your state and shows which electors will represent your state at the meeting of the electors in December of the election year.\" The Electoral College is what mantains everything professional.  If i was to be voted for president i would like to be voted by Electoral College because , electoral college is not voted for the presidents it is voted for the electors , who in turn elect the president . In conclusion , each candidate running for president in your state has thier own group of electors.  In the first article \"What Is the Electoral College?\" by the Office of the Federal Register, the author asserts, \"Most states have a 'winner-take-all' system that awards all the electors to the winning presidential candidate.\" If a presidential candidate spends alot of time, effort, and money in a campaign for a \"swing\" state; he should be awarded all the votes for winning that state. It is a high risk but high reward to spend all that time and money to only earn sixty percent of the votes. That is why a \"winner-take-all\" is crucial. To add on, the author of the first article mentions, \"Each candidate running for President in your state has his or her own group of electors. The electors are generally chosen by the candidate's political party, but state laws vary on how the electors are selected and what their responsibilities are...\" This is saying that a candidate chooses his or her electors, and you vote for the electors to then choose the candidate you voted for  According to source one, \"What Is The Electoral College?\", each political party has it's own set of electors that equal the amount of congressional delegates per state. Usually each state has a \"winner-take-all\" method, so the presidential candidate that gets majority in your state will get all of the electors that represent their party, not just most of them. This is beneficicial to the outcome of the election becuase it makes the ability for a candiate to get majority vote much simpler. There is less of a possibility of a tie, or an outcome where no candidate wins. Source 3, \"In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep out despised method of choosing president\", states that \"even a very slight plurality in a state creates a landslide electoral-vote victory in that state...\" , therefore allowing the candidate to secure all votes to their side, instead of having the votes divided on the line of majority rule, and causing rifts between Electoral College voters.   In the electoral college voters aren't essentially voting for a president but they are voting for a group of electors who will then elect a president. The electors can be picked in many different ways. Sometimes they are they are picked at state conventions, they can be picked at state party's central committe, or sometimes the presidental canidate picks them themselves according to Bradford Plumer (source 2).  Men who are running for a spot as a presidental candidate are not voted for by the citizens of that state. They have to gain supporters who then become the electors. Then the people of that state have to vote for the electors, not the person to become a presidental candidate. Voters can't even directly vote for who they want. What if you vote for a slate of electors, who are supposed to be in favor of the presidnetal candidate you want, but don't vote for him? What happens then? Presidental candidates who should actually get a chance at running for president because they didn't get enough electoral votes.  In the Electoral College, \"voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president\" (Bradford 10). These electors may not necessarily vote for what candidate voters want most as president, and could do what they might feel is the best decision; however, this is not always what the majority of voters want in a president and could end up with a poor president. In addition, most voters know very little about how these electors are chosen and are not in control of who their state's electors are. In a way this system is a bit corrupt, because the voters don't have the final say of the president.  A lot of voters who are not very well educated may not even understand what the electoral college is or what they are actually voting for when they vote. Instead of voting for the candidate that they want as the next president, they are voting for a group of electors that decide who will win. Sometimes, the electors that are assigned to that candiadate will not vote for them. This process also seems to disriciminate against the less populated states because they don't have as much a say in the college and are often forgoten in the rush of propaganda and aren't really aware of who they should pick and why they should pick them.  \"Under the electorial college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president.\" (Paragraph 10). In actuality, voters don't directly vote for the president when it comes to the electoral college. Although the Electoral College \"restores some of the weight in the polititcal balance that large states lose by virtue of mal-apportionment\", (paragraph 21) voters don't have the right to control whom their electors are said author Bradford Plumer. Voting for a group of electors doesn't always mean that they'll vote for the candidate in which you favor. This can have a huge affect on the reputation of the Electoral College itsself. ",

If we eliminate the sport activity from the child it wont benefit them  there is no need to change the grade average to a B. There is no point to it. The team and kids are doing fine just the way it is and changing the grade average will make a big difference, and not in a good way. kids will stop trying out because there is just too much going on and they cant keep up. plus a C is a passing grade and students want to get a higher grade then that because its risky at a C itself. some kids are already struggling and raising the grade will just make it harder. Leave the average the way it is because i could guarantee you that it will not be a good idea. you don't know what kids have to do after school, or go through, and if the students and teachers and coaches are happy then what is the harm?  Many students have a grade C average which would inconvenient them from participating in school sports and/or activities.  Not many students who have a grade B average are athletic to participate in sports but would enjoy participating in school activities such as clubs. But if there are not enough students to participate in school sports it would just be a waste of money to purchase equipment for those sports. Many students who play sports have a grade C average and are very athletic students. It would also be unfortunate for students who do play sports to not be able to participate if they have a grade C average. If those students do not participate they would probably not participate in school activities that they do not enjoy.   Most children these day have about a C not a B because they are more focus on the sport then the grades.  the students are keeping up their grade, and when their grade is getting lower (to a low c) the coach talks to them, saying that they better be careful. it scares the students to be getting a c because that's the boundary line. they shoot for getting an A or B anyways so it wont make a difference. It is just going to scare the kids. Also by changing the grade average it is most likely going to bring down the team numbers. Not as many kids are going to try out because of that. changing even just a little thing makes a big difference, and changing this will make even a bigger difference.  First however, I believe some background knowledge is required. As you know already, a C grade average is considered average in most of our country, where as a B or an A average are considered above average, and outstanding, respectively. Also, as you may know already, most of the student body retains a C average. Your change in school policy would mean that everybody who is currently participating in school activities would be kicked out of them until new term grades come in at which point they may only hope that they did well enough to continue their sport. Our competitive would all fail do to the almost complete rooting of the students. Now this may only last a term, but who knows how long it might take to raise your grade average by a whole letter? You obviously went to school when you were a child, and I assume you enjoyed the extra curricular clubs which your school had to offer. Now imagine this. Imagine that you learned that you had to maintain an A or B average to continue in these sports. Now this was one of the years where you didn't do so well, and therefore got a C average. Wouldn't such a thing be detrimental to you? It would cause you to be kicked out of every activity which you participated in unless you managed to raise your grade! That is one the main points I am putting forth.  This would probably only happen for a couple of years or sport seasons but after awhile everything would be back to normal and it would be just like anything else in the world and people would begin to grow to the B average rule that the principle has.  . It may be because they are not very good test takers or their study habits are very poor. Some might not be able to concentrate and they get distracted very easily. It would be unfair for these students because of their inability to maintain the B average. The school would be responsible for not letting these kids participate in sports and other activities; therefore, in order to give them a better chance at getting the B average, the school should provide tutoring and extra help sessions for the kids who really need the help. The teachers could give them verbal quizzes on what they are learning if they are not very good test takers. They could give them homework that they might better understand and also provide them with extra credit opportunites. The sports teams may despretley need a kid that is very athletic, but not very smart and if this policy were to go into effect, then the school must provide the additional help.  I agree with the change in the policy. Maintaining a grade B average should not be too hard if you have a C average at the time. ",

Not only does it promote and improve other forms of transportation, but it also decreases the amount of smog and air pollution, which are harming our environment.   Although the use of cars may be convienent, the benifits of limiting the usage may be beginning to outweight the inconviences. Between reducing the greenhouse gas creating a cleaner environment as well as lessening stress and making the roads safer, the advantages of limiting car usage in the United States are major.     In recent years, the environment has become a worldwide concern; one of the advantages to limiting car usage is that it will positively impact the environment.  All in all, there are many advantages that could easily come with limiting car usage, including the reduction of smog and a more pleasent lifestyle for the citizens who decide to limit or cease their auto usage. While transportation issues may arise when people begin to give up their motorized vehicle, or if they decide to not purchase one in the first place, as many already have, a quick purchase of a bike or the use of public transit can solve at least some of them.     Not only are the advantages of limiting car usage subtle however they are also direct and can have immediate positive effects on people. By making sure people do not overdo the amount they utilize their cars, they become less stressed, have a healthier environment, and save money. This issue is worldwide however, the solution is becoming worldwide as well creating exceptional results and care from car drivers and people are really thinking outside of the box to make magic happen.  the reduction of air pollution and smog has become a major advantage in the limitation of car usage.  Smog, backed up traffic ways, and stress seem to be the main factor contributing to the decrease in car usage. Although these seem to be very negative factors, there are many advantages to limiting car use including helping our Planet Earth and less costly factors.  An advantage to reducing car usage is a more benifical enviroment and a better overall health standard. ",

As a student I want the best for the up coming generations, including me, that are going to be able to be a part of the presidential elections and to not be confused who to vote for or how the electoral college works. Every year a new generation becomes legal to vote and be part of the election but if they dont know how to vote or how it works then they wont be able to. Some people dont know anything about poitics but, still want to be able to vote so, it should be easy for them to vote for who they want to be president rather then the long process of, voting for the canidates elector and most of the time they dont vote for who they want and they vote for the wrong person.       \u00a0  Secondly, the electoral college (in addition to putting down the voter) has been proven to be faulty.  Another disadvantage is that the system of Electoral College is very confusing to many people.  The voters are left with an unfair outcome at almost every election because of the Electoral Collage. The votes can either be very close or the people could miss Ads or campaigns for canidates, leaving the people with nothing and confusion all over. Even if you knew what elector you voted for, you cant necessarily pick who it is your voting for and your vote could possibly get confued giving you a bad outcome. Most elections are just slid by and are just based on what ever the Electoral College thinks should happen. So please abolish the Electoral College its is irrational and is not neccessary, let the people really have a fair chance.  First, voters can walk into the booth and \"...get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate\" (Plumer 10). Not every voter is educated on exactly how the electors and candidates are represented on the ballot and that may lead to an accidental win. On top of this misconception, almost decietfully, an elector promised to a candidate can change their vote at a moments notice(Plumer 10). Even Posner who writes for the electoral college admitted that it is possible, and he claims that it is \"rare\";however, it has happened before in 1960 (Plumer 11), and not even Posner can control the actions of an elector, legally anyway. Also, when a candidate wins a popular vote, which is the true mind of the people, that candidate still may not win the electoral vote, overall, loosing the election. This happened just a few years back in the 2000 election between President Bush and Gore(Posner 16).All in all, the electoral college does not represnt the people.  The Electoral college voting system is not fair in the way the present system works. The system does not show proper representation of the people, does not promote interest in voting, and causes a candidate to ignore the states in which do not have a large amount of electoral votes.  Secondly, Having an Electoral College avoids run-off elections, where the problem is cause by each canidate that is running to not get any of the majority of the votes.  Secondly, the electoral college simply takes away from voting in general.  because when they vote for a president they are really voting for electors. The elctors can be any citizen so the voters don't know who the electors are. Voters can rarely decide who the electors vote for which puts them at a disadvantage and is an inconvience for the voters. \"Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president\" (source 2).

So, it would be best if he looked over his essay and ,with his thesis in mind, start over from scratch.  The more compliments you receive, the more people who say they like the idea. Many famous writers used other people's thoughts to see whether or not their book is good, and they ask for their opinion. An example from me is my favorite series of books:  Gone Series.  On the front cover of the book, it has one quote from an author, and on the back there were many other quotes from other companies. Adding to the quotes, on the top of the book said  #1 New York best Selling Book , basically saying to new readers that this series is good and popular. That is usually why on the front cover or back cover of a book contains a quote from different people or companies showing their good opinion about this book, so the readers can see that since this person liked the book, then it must be a good book to read. Having an award on your book also brings in popularity because winning something like the Pulitzer prize can bring a ton of attention to your book.

In the article, the author continously offers alternatives for exploration. He does this is paragraphs' 5,6, and 7 where he gives examples of organizations that are working towards this exploration. However in all of the paragraphs, the author seems to only be giving \"what if\" scenarios or in some cases just simple ideas that have been thought about and are possibly being examined. He fails to provide any real data or statistics for these things, except when he mentions the simplified electronics in paragraph 7. Even then, those devices are only able to survive for 3 weeks, so it would still take many years to just improve those devices. Also, in paragraph 6 the author states, \"Many researchers are working on innovations that would allow our machines to last long enough to contribute meaningfully to our knowledge of Venus\". This statement is very broad, and it does not key in on any form of information that should lead us to believe that to be true. These details from the passage prove my point on the amount of years it would take, as well as the fact that nobody has any idea how long. The question to be asked here is, \"Is it worth the wait?\". For these reaons I stand behind my claim that the author supported the idea of exploring venus very poorly.   Each person comes from a different background, they all have their own knowledge and ideas. Consulting different people will lead to tons of information on whether you are making the best choice. One example is that publishers make authors send their books to professional editors, editors advise the authors to add some of their ideas and fix any mistakes that are shown. This goes to show that having another person that will give helpful bits of information will help make a much better decision.   The author only provides two solutions to the numerous problems that he previously stated.  Lastly, the author supports their idea by telling us how we are going to uncover more information without loosing more.  The author did a good job in making his claims and then proceeding to back them up with evidence and facts. Although he had some opinions, the article was overall well written and well put together. The author convinced me, as the reader, that exploring Venus is definitely worth a few more tries.  Furthermore, the author uses facts intended to continue to convince readers that Venus is dangerous, when this is exactly the opposite of what the author is arguing for. Making statements which invoke fear or apprehension only pushes the reader away from the topic, instead of influencing him or her to gain interest in it. For instance, when the author uses phrases with negative connotations, such as \"thick atmosphere\", \"corosive sulfuric acid\", \"800 degrees Fahrenheit\", and \"extreme\", they influence readers negatively as well.   Throughout reading this article I thought it provided very good and extensive research. Although I did see some major issues with the leading point of the passage. This author provided very good research but the research and evidence throughout the entire article controdicted their main message. ",

I am writing to the state senator of florida to argue in favor of keeping the Electoral College.  In conclusion, Mr. State Senator, I think that keeping the Electoral College is the best thing for our country. If we changed to election by popular vote, the man (or woman) might not be the best for our country, and the best man might not win because he is not a regional favorite. I hope, sir, that you will take my letter into account when you go to vote on this topic.       \u00a0     I\u00a0 belive that my state senator should remove the electoral colleges. To change the election by popular vote for the president of the United States.  Dear Senator: I'am writing you this letter to inform you that I argue in favor of keeping the Electoral College. Why?  im writting this letter to you so you consider changing to election by popular vote for the prsident of the united states instead of electoral college. i belive like branford plumer, that the electoral college is very wrong not only because under the electoral college system, voters dont vote for the president but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president. but also because it is very unfair to voters, candidates dont spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the \"swing\" states.  Dear state senator, I think that we should change to start voting by popular vote  For my conclusion this proves that there are many difficulties along the way of an election, regarding the votes and voters. With this letter being written, people should not wonder whether or not the electoral college should be abolished, and go with the popluar voting method. You shouldn't be thinking about just a couple of people, but of a whole nation and deciding who is worthy enough in our eyes to lead us to more victories with the popular voting method.     To summarize, and simplify (what should be done with our voting ways) this letter to you, we should remove the electoral college overall and implement the popular voting, to which our country is based off of. This is the most profound way of fixing the problems that we face: the unsimplicity known as our current voting ways, and the restablishment of our original, and hopefully still true government of Democracy, and Popular Soveriegnty.     I am writing this letter to you today to talk to you about Electoral College and election by popular vote. I feel very strongly on this topic as it is something I\u00a0 know I\u00a0 will come in contact with when i have the right to vote in the near future.  As we look back to the very day the Constitution was written, it has been a comprise that between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizen that fifve hundred and thirty eight electorshave a meeting for they vote for President and Vice President, and the counting of the electoral votes by Congress, as stated by the Office of the Federal Register.

When I was trying to decide which sleep-away camp I wanted to attend this summer, I had to ask my parents and my friends to decide. My parents told me that because one of the camps was extremely expensive, it would be better for me to go to the other one. My friends, on the other hand, told me that instead of choosing one or the other, I should go to a completely different camp, one that has the activities of both previous camps mentioned and cost less than each one. I did not know about this camp, and didn't even consider trying to find a camp with the benefits of both the ones I wanted to attend. But using my friends' wider perspectives, I was able to find a completely new and customized solution for me. They also could have provided important information about the new camp that I was not aware of to advise me on my decision. ",

                "content": "Over all, I believe that banning phones from school is a bad idea. None of the students would follow the rule, and they would just bring them to school and hide them. This will get zero progress, and will create no change in the school environment. If you let students text during free time, it could keep students from texting during class, and help them focus more. By distracting the students while they are outside or have free time, it could prevent them from doing something to get them in trouble. And less people would be angry. You would not have angry students or parents coming up to the school to take back a confiscated item, thus not having to bother with any angry people. This is where I stand on the policies, but the final decision is up to you.  As you can see, their are many more cons then there are pros for cell phones allowed during class. Policy 2 is the right choice because it allows students to get in touch with whoever they need to contact, It can keep a student from cheating and save them the trouble that comes along with it, and it is also a way to slow down rumors, and a save a child's reputation. All just by removing cell phones from school.  These almost everyone has a phone and even now at schools everyone is on them. I think that the with being home and having classes the phone will be like one of the main problem because of how addicting it is  Rumors can ruin a persons reputation, that's a known fact. High school students and even middle school students love to talk. If cell phones were allowed, rumors would fly around the school. In a matter of minutes, everyone would know the latest gossip, just by one person pressing the \"Send to all\" button. This can lead to bullying, which could also lead to a flaw in that student's education. So no matter what, cell phones are a disadvantage to a school.  It may be one of the worst mistakes made by adults, thinking that taking away cell phones will solve all of their problems. It will only make kids made ,who will in turn make adults and teachers alike, miserable. If you haven't found out already, cell phones are actually for the benefit of all, even in a school environment. It will make life for teachers a breeze and likewise for kids. For all of these reasons and so many more I would ask you with the sincerity of my heart that you will please consider letting us use our cell phones in school.   What harm would it do to allow students to use their phones during their lunch and break times? Class wouldn't be disrupted, teachers wouldn't be annoyed, and the students would still be able to have the phones that they enjoy using every day. By changing the phone policy, the school would be taking our rights away. This is also very unfair to those who use their phones outside of class. If we can't be trusted with phones only during our break times, then the school would be showing us great disrespect  If cell phones were allowed during classes, instead of only during lunch periods and other free times, they would be put to use constantly. Students would be able to communicate through text message throughout the classroom, and the teacher would never know. If a student had an Internet connection on his/her phone, they would be able to play games, go on websites that are not allowed in school, and so on. This would all take place right under the teacher's nose, but they would have no way of knowing what was going on. This could be a serious problem for a student's education too. Since cell phones are such a distraction, Students could miss important lessons taught that day, and may fall behind.  Student should be allowed to keep there phones on their person as long as they are turned off at all times during a regular school day. this then creates the problem of students texting during school hours and class so I propose that students who are caught texting or using the cell phone during school our not in the case of an emergency should have there phones took away for a set amount of time. much like if a student does something wrong he/she is punished with a certain amount of time.  We all know that this is already a big problem here. If the new rule is made, the no cell phone rule wont get any 'better'. In fact, the problem will just slowly get worse until texting in class gets out of hand. If cell phones are allowed in school just during lunch, it could be in one kid's mind thinking, \"If its allowed at lunch, then the teacher wont be so strict on texting in class.\" Once one kid starts flipping out the cell phone in class, other people will catch on and turn on their mobile devices too. In a matter of months, it could lead to more detentions, more suspensions, and more angry parents. So think, what is the positive of having cell phones even at lunch?  Cell phones are huge distractions in school. They lead to high school drop outs because of their grades and, not to mention, they lead to low income. If we let students use cell phones more in school they may get the thought they can do whatever they want. We need to put a stop to this now so our future generations will be able to support their families. ",

                "content": "One reason that consiracy theorist could beleive that this could be an alien stucture is that the resolution of the first picture was very low.  Aliens never made the Face of Mars and the Face of Mars isn't real at all! It's just a natural landform by having the shadows covering up most of the landform making it appear as a face. For the conclusion, Cydonia has a natural landform on it that appears itself as a face using the shadows to make the illusion.  In conclusion, the face is just a natural landform. It may look like a head, but that is just because of the unusual shadows that the mesa has. If my co-workers and I thought this was actually proof of alien life, why would we hide it from you? What is the point in hiding that kind of information?  It does look like it could be from another living organism, but it's just a rock on the planet. In our newest image of the rock, it turns out that the face has dissapered. There is no evidence of this being created by aliens, rather it was created by wind and water that has been found on Mars. The reason you might believe that this was indeed aliens, might be the fact that the news has blown it out of poportion. It's just the rock that had some interesting shadows and holes that made it look like a human face.  Do you believe in aliens? An abundance of people in America think there are others among us from other planets and galaxies. They believe this for a variety of reasons, such as UFO sightings or because of the so-called \"Face\" in Cydonia on the Red Planet Mars. Throughout the years since 1976 we have worked at NASA to discover the secrets of the face, uncovering that it is indeed just a landform with suspicious shadows.  There you have it. The Face sadly wasn't built by aliens, it was just a natural landform that happened to have some pretty neat features to it due to shadows. There is no way around it, because the pictures don't lie. It is even more obvious that it is a landform because ones just like it exist on Earth! Even though it would've been very interesting for it to have been actually created by aliens, it was just a natural landform in the end.  The author states that scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa when the face appeared. This shows that they have seen things like this before and they knew that it wasn't real, or alien like. Another example that the author proves is that Garvin said it reminded him of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. The camera on board MGS had to peer through wispy clouds to see the face and perhaps alien markings were hidden by haze. Also NASA can be hidding information about the Face. But, you can see that the Face is formed by shadows, and not an alien haze.  In conclusion, some people may think there is alien life on Mars because of past picture or conspiracy theories. No one can denty however, that NASA has proven the Face to be nothing but a natural landform on the Red Planet Mars. NASA has proven this by recent pictures, scientific evidence, and real-life examples and measurements. Over the years, NASA has worked hard to figure out the mystery of the face, and just recently they have discovered, with pictyures, evidence, and measruements, that the Face is just a natural landform with unusual shadowing formed on the Red Planet Mars.  I find it highly unrealistic that NASA would even have been able to determine what the Face was forty years ago, much less hiding a discovery of extra-terrestrial life that could make a huge profit for the space program. And, had NASA really claimed that the Face was an object built by otherworldly life, surely someone would let the cat out of the bag. Not to mention that, if the vast majority of NASA believed it was an alien monument, do you really think that they would wait eighteen years to investigate the subject again? On top of all of this, it's simply illogical that aliens would create such a thing. As far as we all know, the supposed \"aliens\" on Mars have never come in contact with a human, much less seen one. That only leaves possible explanation; aliens created a monument that of which coincedentally resembles a human head. An absolute coincedence.  the only reason the natural landform even remotely looked like a face was because of shadows. ",

                "content": "Multiple times, the author delves into a side-topic as opposed to continuing on with the topic of Venus exploration. They start off the article with two sentences that have no relation to the story, yet confuse readers. The sentences are about Venus' nickname, the \"Evening Star\", and how even though it is a planet, it is still called this. This is completely irrelevant to exploration, as everyone knows it is a planet, and the \"Evening Star\" name is never mentioned again. Later on in the passage, the author rambles on about World War II-age computers and how they functioned properly even before the digital age. Once more, this is slightly irrelevant and does not contribute to the story at all except to add another paragraph instead of focusing on the specifics of how NASA is using them to help with Venus.  The first paragraph introduces the topic of Venus with an interesting hook, but does not give the reader their side. The reader needs a thesis, without one the reader is not going to be able to have their opinion on a topic swayed. The author's current attempt at a thesis statement , \"While Venus is simple to see from the distant but safe vantage point of Earth, it has proved very challenging place to examine more closely,\" does not state what side they are on clearly. Their best declaration of the side they are on is in their very last paragraph. The author wrote, \"Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation.\" This is a very strongly worded thesis, but would have been much better if placed in the starting paragraph. Their side on the topic was acknowledged, but not as well as it could have been if they had set up their thesis correctly.  In conclusion the author does not give many benefits to exploring Venus. All he really did was list the benefits to why we shouldnt explore Venus. In my personal opinion if i where a scientest and somone read me this i would not want to explore Venus. In the end i do not believe the author makes a good case to explore Venus.  The author did not make it extremly obvious as to what he was truly trying to convey. If he would been more clear and less contradictive, then it would have been more obvious that he supports the idea that Venus is worthy of being explored. Also, it would have been easier to understand the point he was trying to put across if he would have stayed on topic throughout the article. The message of the article should be obviously supported by the author.       The author does not support her claim that Venus is worth studying despite the dangers it presents. First, the author only mentions support for her claim in the last paragraph of the article. Second, the author presents a solution to the problem, but says that no data can be gained from the experience because of the conditions of Venus. Third, the author presents the dangers of exploring Venus, and those dangers outweigh the benefits of exploring the planet.   First, the author brings up his topic of \" Studying Venus is a worhty pursuit despite the dangers it presents\". Despite this, the author only gave one full paragraph, out of the eight he wrote, on why humans would want to explore the planet ; he then preceeded to go onto the dangers of Venus, rather than why it is worth exploring.  The author is aware of the fact and describes how, \"no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours\" (paragraph 2). Right off the bat, the author gives their audience the mindset that it is not a good idea to study Venus. Having that fact in the first few paragraphs of the article sets the tone for the rest of the article. In paragraph three, the author goes into great detail about several of the potential dangers that can come from studying Venus because of its, \"clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid\" (paragraph 3). The frightening environment described strays the audience even further away from believing that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers  As the author continues with their argument, readers become increasingly aware that Venus is likely not as beneficial as the author intends to make it seem. With an unlivable biome and dangerous atmospheric conditions, Venus is likely far too hazardous to explore at this time in history, and I believe that the author of this article unwittingly proved so. For these reasons, I believe that the author of this article failed to support their thesis with thorough evidence or detail.        In Paragraph 4, the author states, \"Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system.\" If this is true, then could Venus become like Earth once again?  Throughout the article, it suggests that studying Venus is still a worthy mission for astronomers, however, the dangers that come along with these missions are extremely dangerous and life-threatening. The author mentions the curiosity that scientists have involving Earth's sister planet, and the desire to still visit Venus regardless of the harsh conditions. With the article's use of both previous experiences of missions and spacecrafts, as well as shocking factual statistics of Venus, the claim is very strongly supported with evidence.  ",

                "content": "Humans can often acknowledge how they are feeling, but the acknowledgement itself does not allow them to feel better. As stated in the article, \"They even indicate the difference between a genuine smile and a forced one\" (D'Alto 7). This line states that the lab partner will be able to tell a difference netween a genuine and meaningful smile from a harshly forced smile. There is a difference between the two because smiling will not make you happy although it is a happy gesture. The machine informing someone that they need to smile will not actually change the emotions of that person. Politicians and celebrities are major culprits of this action. They often smile as they are told to do, but they are not always genuine. They are typically hiding something from their spectators such as when they are not being truthful (D'Alto 8). Just because famous people smile when talking or looking at their audience does not change whether or not they are happy individuals. If humans themselves are unable to change their emotions when they can detect that something is wrong, then machines will be unable to do that also. Although it can give people a precise measurement of their emotions, it will not change how they feel. Therefore, investing in this system would be extremely useless and wasteful.  This technology could also help both students and teachers in a long-term manner. In paragraph 7 of the article, it is revealed that this new technology could \"even indicate the difference between a genuine smile and a forced one\" (Paragraph 7). Say there is a classroom without an emotion-sensing computer. In the classroom there is a student who, behind the fake smile is dealing with something that they cannot tackle on their own. The teacher never notices, and the child goes on without help. Now imagine if there was a computer in that class  The article states that the technology associates each emotion with \"characteristic movements of the facial muscles\" and then uses those movements to calculate the spectrum of emotions based on their facial display. But some people show emotions in various ways, and the technology most likely cannot accomodate for the many different ways people express the same emotion. For example, if a student has a resting face that seems generally happy, the system might confuse this dazed face as a satisfied face and think that the student is happy with their lessons when they are actually confused or not paying attention. In the same way, if a student has a resting face that looks naturally sad, the system may think they are unhappy with their lessons, even if the student feels they are learning a lot. A lot of students also try to hide their emotions, like frusteration or sadness, with a happier look on their face, and even though the article states that the system can detect a \"false smile\", it cannot always be accurate as a person may be good at hiding their emotions and displaying a genuine smile. Therefore, since technology is not always accurate and because human beings are so various in the way they behave, the technology would not be useful in a classroom where it may misread a student's state of mind and lead them in the wrong path of education.  As described in paragraph 6, a students facial expression has the power to change a lesson. If this is true, could a student not simply fake an emotion to get out of assignments or slack off by acting confused. The article claims that the software can pick up on fake smiles, but can it detect false expressions for other emotions as well? Another flaw within this system is the emotions the technology is capable of percieving, paragraph 6 disscusses the modification of a lesson based on boredom or confusion detected by the computer, however, neither of these two feelings are listed in the 6 emotions that the software is capable of detecting (paragraph 3). These two major flaws within the software lead to only one conclusion, the technology is simply not advanced enough to take on the role of a teacher.  It is no secret that many students dread coming to school, whether it be from stress, bullying, or simply not understanding the subjects. This system can pick up on a fake emotion, the author explains how it can read a \"fake smile\" and that to them \"faces don't lie\" (para. 8). If this system is able to sense when a student is unhappy or angry, this could be used as an advantage in helping the student. Not only this, but the author explains that \"moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions, but may even help produce them\" (para. 9). Taking both of these statements into account, and allowing them to be incorporated into the classroom, students may enjoy attending school and learning new things.  Lastly, if the physical problems of the technology have not already been offputting, then maybe the moral problem of this technology will sway opinions against using it in a classroom. If this technology really can \"indicate the difference between a genuine smile and a forced one\", then this means it can invade people's privacy and indicate an emotion which a person is trying to hide.  Dr. Huang is talking about how it can change the ads you see and veiw if you dont look happy when you look at them. Dr. Huang states \"For example when a web ad appears on your screen and you smile a similar ad may follow, But if you frown the next ad will be different. A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,\" Dr. Huang predicts. This Quote and prediction of Dr. Huang states that is has potential to keep students intrestred into work  With the constant evoultion of the way we learn, its not suprising that something like FACS was created. Emotions have been with everything living since the beginning of time. Before FACS, it was suprisingly difficult to read these emotions in people. Such a crucial part of our everyday lives could be easily hidden away by a fake smile or a theatre tear. But now that there is FACS helping out, looks are no longer decieving.  The FACS will pick up emotions that a student is feeling and teachers, parents, and or consoulers will be able to get the help that that particular student aqquires. \"To an expert, faces don't lie; these muscle clues are sometimes used to spot when a \"smiling\" politicain or celebrity isn't being truthful.\" This same concept can work with students too. If a student is giving off a false emotion than that student really feels; the FACS can determine the actual emotion the student is feeling. If teachers and parents realize the actual feelings and emotions someone feels, he or she will be able to provide more comfort in the act of helping towards that individual.  The amount of improvement a classroom could see if this technology was implemented correctly would be immeasurable. The system could prevent students from falling behind in class because they cannot relate to how the teacher is teaching, and the technology could see through fake expressions hiding more troubled thoughts. With this sort of system, it may actually be possible to \"make everyone happy.\"    ",

                "content": "When I brought up going to chess club earlier I thought that I would dread it but it turned out to be super fun. I also met some of my best friends that I still talk to today, they were super inviting and had a passion for the game and enjoyed it. I had never seen anyone enjoy a game that much. When thinking about it, it seems like a very funny and interesting story how you met your friends but when I talk to some kids they tell me that they met their best friends\u00a0of today by simply sharing the same interests and that is a great way to make friends. When going to a certain activity you go because you enjoy that one thing, well the other people there also enjoy that activity and now you know a whole bunch of people who share a common interest with you. sometimes even the smallest things can spark a friendship maybe you and someone play the same position on a sports team that can be a great reason to be friends or to even talk, doing extra curricular activities gets you out of your comfort zone and makes you feel just open and wanting to talk to people. When going to a certain activity thinking of how the people there are gonna act is a huge thing but most likely the environment is very welcoming and it makes you want to keep doing that one thing with the same people because of how they treated you. In conclusion making friends is a big deal and doing an extracurricular activity can play a huge role and help with making friends.  It doesn't matter if you have a mistake or two in your idea that was pointed out by someone. What matters most is that you asked people for their opinion, and having the best idea you can have. When you ask people for their opinion, it gives you inspiration, courage, and perseverance to keep on doing your best, because in the end, it can turn out to be the best thing you ever did, maybe receiving a ton of money, winning awards for your accomplishments, or meeting other famous people who also like and use your idea on a daily basis. If your idea just doesn't work out in the end, you could either ask more people for their opinion on how to revive your idea, or it can be your end to the project and give up on the idea. Either way, it can at least be the most fun you've had working on an idea in your life.  Truthfully it is just another way to tell someone no to doing this or that or it is a continuation of limiting people on their creativity. Back in 6th grade most people had a problem with the art tecaher because she had such strict rules in a way it was either her way or the highway. No one could really understand why she had us doing things this way or that way. With that being said everyone was hoping that one day she would actually miss a day and one day she called out but then I looked around me everyone was having a fun time because they could express themselves through their art. All students need to be able to express themselves without having someone telling them that they are doing things wrong.  The more compliments you receive, the more people who say they like the idea. Many famous writers used other people's thoughts to see whether or not their book is good, and they ask for their opinion. An example from me is my favorite series of books:  Gone Series.  On the front cover of the book, it has one quote from an author, and on the back there were many other quotes from other companies. Adding to the quotes, on the top of the book said  #1 New York best Selling Book , basically saying to new readers that this series is good and popular. That is usually why on the front cover or back cover of a book contains a quote from different people or companies showing their good opinion about this book, so the readers can see that since this person liked the book, then it must be a good book to read. Having an award on your book also brings in popularity because winning something like the Pulitzer prize can bring a ton of attention to your book. It can give you more to believe in that your project will be good because you have many people who say your project is good. Not just the people who say that it's just \"good\", but also the people who point out the things that they especially liked within your idea, such as, \"I liked how you included this part to make that huge problem go away.\" These kinds of compliments makes you feel even better inside, and it tells you that you can take your mind off that one part of the idea and imagine more possible problems.  Paragraph 8 discusses making the driving fun by entertaining them. Whereas Paragraph 7 is about the driver taking over and the different functions to make them aware. The key to having the person aware of the dangerous situation is to not have them distracted in the first place. Plus that prevents any accidents if flaws in the warning system should occur. The reason there is a long lasting trust in human judgement on the road is that the people have a chance to take action quick enough. If they were not previously paying attention due to the driverless car then that chance is wasted by them attempting to figure out what the situation is in the first place. Eliminate the possibilty of that irresponsible lack of attention by having the person drive to begin with.  I also believe the school administration should create a presentation showing students that this can be indeed a very fun task!  . For example, the famous filmmaker and entrepreneur Walt Disney was not always successful with his work. At the start of his career he drew little art work pieces for a small local newspaper company, although he wasn't able to profit from his drawings that much, he still loved his job because it was something he wanted and loved to do. It can be seen that people are able to go through tough times if they are able to express themselves freely. Another example would be is when my science class was assigned a group project and students had the freedom to do whatever they wanted to do. My group decided to do it on climate change, which wasn't very appealing to me at the time, but as I learned and dug in deeper into the topic, I found it more and more interesting which led to me being more educated in climate change and gaining new knowledge made it was more memorable. This shows that when students have the freedom to choose and design their own projects; it helps students learn something they never knew about, which leads to students being more educated.  The thought of a project is always a dreadful one that all, will have a hard time to get them self\u00a0to do it but a student-designed project will make it at least, a more enjoyable experience. Students can utilize their brain and knowledge to make it a project to remember and have fun while thinking of an idea to blow teachers and fellow classmates away once they return from break. For example, a science fair allows students to show a unique idea with experiments, this causes fun competition\u00a0and a enjoyable process on how the project is going to \"wow' the judges. Speaking of competition, if the project would also have an incentive to try to achieve the best project, students would even be more thrilled. The student-designed project will show a big amount of their own ability to the assignment and make them strive for the number one spot. This would heighten the accomplishment of the project and give them a sense of excitement for their own unique project to compete with classmates. In the end, rather than having a normal boring project, students who have a chance to design their own project, will have a lot more fun and excitement\u00a0in the process of doing the project, in which, will still allow them to learn and not interrupt with their fun and relaxing summer break.  When a person asks the people around them for an opinion, they are often bombarded with a plethora of different reasons. However, when they talk with one person in particular it is enough to allow them to finally make a decision. For me, this person was my uncle. My uncle helped me formulate the best course of action, which took into account all of the reasons I had been exposed to, as well as statistics pertaining to the importance of a high school\u00a0grade point average. He told me anecdotes from back when he was in high school, and disproved the stigma that your grades define your success in high school. This final outlook was enough to make me decide to take Geometry Honors. Although one person finally tipped the scales, without asking all of the people prior I would not have came to the same conclusion.  Students have their interests, they either like something, or they don't. Something might not come off as interesting to them at first glance. They might only start to realize something is interesting to them when they take another look. If schools do an event that shows off each different club, students will get that \"second glance\" that they need. For example, my older brother wanted to join a club in high school. He looked through the website and found that nothing sounded interesting to him. He decided to look again, this time actually reading the descriptions of each club. He eventually found the art club. He read the description, thought it sounded interesting and signed up. ",

It is an amazing chance to get into this program and visit the unique places on the way to the adventure.  The driverless cars would be more practical for some people because, if they can completely drive themselves, the passengers would not need a liscence or insurance like they would if they were driving the car themselves. However, the car would perform the same duties as a car they might own, unlike other forms of public-transportation. For example, busses cannot pick you up or drop you off at your home, so if the bus stop is not near to your house, it is not reasonable to ride the bus to work or other places. However, the taxi service would be able to pick you up no matter where you were. This would also be helpful if you were stranded somewhere and you needed help. ",

It does not make sense that the academy would keep an alien encounter hidden.   With more details about what they are trying to find, it would be easier to evaluate whether or not the scientist efforts are really worth it, or just a waste of time. A planet that is inhabitable by humans or anything living is already a risk as is.        The author states that the value of returning to Venus is indesputable, yet horribly dangerous. Danger should not put off scientists into further discovering that planet, but rather it should encourage them to work even harder in order to someday provide a safe passage between Earth and Venus. This would be beneficial to human society, because it could potentially help rid future problems of overpopulation and even provide insight on what Earth may become.  There are countries and people who are already in debt, we should be trying to help them out before we try to spend billions on smart roads. We also can not just rely on technology to keep us safe, there are already an aboundant amount of technology malfunctions going on, adding this to the equation would not help. Lastly, one that will probably have more of a concern with everyone would be privacy, I do not believe most people would feel safe knowing they are being watched as they are driving, and knowing that fact could even possibly make them unfocused. Driverless cars was a good idea, but I personally do not believe that anyone is ready for them.  Venus is not worth the time, effort and resources to explore. The planet proves to be too dangerous for mankind and even for machines. Curiosity is not sufficiant enough of a reason to explore and learn about a inhospitable planet unless it is going to benefit mankind more than what it costed to gain that information. The resources that are going to Venus should be redirected to another cause that will benefit society and life as we know it.  Despite claiming that \"Venus can sometimes be our nearest option for a planetary visit\", there is little evidence given that exploring and observing Venus would be of much benefit. In fact, the author seems to have found more evidence against Venus exploration, as the prior paragraph (which listed reasons that Venus was dangerous) was much more explicit and detailed than paragraph 3. The negatives of exploring Venus (such as death and wasted money or time) seem to far outweigh the positives.  Do you believe in aliens? An abundance of people in America think there are others among us from other planets and galaxies. They believe this for a variety of reasons, such as UFO sightings or because of the so-called \"Face\" in Cydonia on the Red Planet Mars. Throughout the years since 1976 we have worked at NASA to discover the secrets of the face, uncovering that it is indeed just a landform with suspicious shadows.  In conclusion, the author supports the exploration of Venus, and is open to finding ways to explore this harsh planet. He believes that the knowledge we would gain from Venus would be very beneficial to the people. He believes that mankind has endured many other harsh endeavors such as the exploration of Venus, and the curosity of mankind will likely lead us to exploring the great hot planet of Venus.  This is why and how dangerous Venus can be and how there condtions are extreme. Peopel would not risk dying to get some samples from Venus or try to go to  Venus. This why its not worth to study and analize samples of Venus and later on they can try to find better material or things to help out the space ship and humans to try to land or analize any samples from Venus.  Not only would releasing such infrormation to the public leave NASA with all sorts of world renouned achievements, it would be more than beneficial for the company's financial standpoint. Releasing statements as big as signs of life on Mars would do wonders for the company. The more achievements, the more sponsors will see the potential in investing money in a program such as NASA. Adding to that, the more sponsors, the more projects NASA can fund, and by extension, the more the foundation will be able to learn and teach the public. ",

Cell phones do not make any difference in a lunch time setting. They do not disturb anyone around us, and they do not harass the learning environment.  Second of all, if we were able to use our phones in lunch periods or free times then what will be the point of students getting in trouble all the time because of cell phones.  Cell phones are huge distractions in school. They lead to high school drop outs because of their grades and, not to mention, they lead to low income. If we let students use cell phones more in school they may get the thought they can do whatever they want. We need to put a stop to this now so our future generations will be able to support their families.  Calling your parent for a quick minute or two may secure your way of getting home or even to obtain a book you might have left at home for your next class. Also, talking to other classmates throughout your school may give you extra time to study with them or to finish a couple of assignments you were unsure about or needed help on. Communicating with cell phones will provide you extra time to do this by sending a text or giving them a quick call, after all lunch time and free periods don't last forever. This takes less time and gives you extra time for many other priorities you may have.  Sometimes, when a student isn't able to call a parent, they end up waiting for an hour or more outside the school until he/she is picked up from school. Students need to be able to use cell phones for situations like these, especially when they much homework to complete for school because then they have less time to do their required work.  In today's world, things like video games, cell phones, and computers fill up teenagers lives and distract them from things like homework. Schools and classrooms however, either have don't have those distractions or put limits on them to keep students working and not playing games or texting. If some people can't even complete their homework because of these distractions at home, then how will they complete their daily home schooling assignments on top of that? Student work completion would drop and their futures will be impacted dramatically. Many people, especially teenagers, need guidance and restrictions in order to get work done. Even though some students have already created that habit for themselves of getting work done, others have not and giving them an option of distance learning will be devastating for them.  Students have so much homework to do when they come home from school, and sometimes it can become overwhelming. Students need to be able to spend time with friends after school and not be always thinking of all the work that needs to get done by the next day. Taking a short break is helpful and make them feel less stressed about their schoolwork. So, students should also be able to use their cell phones to call or text friends to schedule activities together. They can even study for an upcoming test or quiz together, so they can get a higher grade.  Everyone has them, students and faculty alike. Some families live out of state or in other countries, causing students to be forced to miss weeks at a time. Throughout these weeks, the students would miss many lectures, assignments, tests, quizzes and important projects. Allowing those who are gone to stay on top by using a computer, would allow students to focus more on their family in a time of worry, instead of worrying how they are going to make up their test in their third period math class. The stress of having a family emergency on top of the already extremely stress inducing schoolwork, can become too much for many, leaving them exhausted and unable to catch up. The inability to catch up for some, can cause them to drop out of school all together, as the stress and pressure would build and build up. This can ruin students' futures and take a lot of opportunities out of their hands.  During lunch or free time, children will have conversations on their phones with their friends. After lunch, these students will still be in a conversation and will continue it. Students will be sneaking their phones into classes just to finish talking to their friends. This policy will be abused by these kids and more and more kids will have phones in class than intended. ",

Others might take embarrassing photos of somebody else and ruin their life.  The only way to stop this from happening is to ban cell phones for good, however that can also take away the privileges that some students deserve, so what should happen to the policy?  Here is my answer.  While one solution may not work very well, another may be the best one for you. Asking more people also increases the chances of finding someone who had to make the same decision or was in the same situation. This would be incredibly helpful because they could give advice on what they chose to do and the result. For example, when I was working on a difficult math problem, I asked many people for their ideas on how to approach it. Though some of them could not solve the problem or help me, others came up with brilliant solutions. One of them had seen a similar problem before, so he pointed me in the right direction. By asking more than one person for advice, I received many choices from which I could pick the best one.  I think in the end that this would be a good thing because it would make students want to try harder in school if they really like a sport and wanted to bring their grade up to be able to play this sport. Then again i think every school should have to have this rule because it would be unfair to one team if the other team did not have the players they wanted because of this rule. I think you could take this rule and put it into school systems and see improvement all over the state then maybe all over the country. So yes i think that even though it would cause a lot of trouble it would be a good thing to raise grades all over the country.  I hope other schools get inspired by these online classes and give students a chance to try it out, because after all, a students education is what's most important.\u00a0  I hope that you take this letter into your consideration, and I hope you decide well on this policy. Some may disagree, some may downright despise the policy, but in the end, it does everyone a favor, and that's hard to argue with from a logical standpoint. In the end, it's the simple fact that education comes before all else, because it's more likely that one would become a doctor, a lawyer, or an engineer than a professional sports player, and allowing the minimum work to pass won't help the student later on in life.  By doing this action we might get sponsors or people might donate money to because we worked so hard by helping it and taking care of it the community might give back. Also I think if we do this more people will want to come to our school to enroll or interview us  And my explanation for that is because if they want to have a more clearer picture then they should take another one up there. And again they might even get an even bettere and bigger because of the technology we have today. It might be even in high definition so that they can see if thats actually a face or if its just a mountain with craters. But they might get me wrong and thats ok but as long as they have a better camera to explain how or what i'm right about. Like in the beginning of this article it said that they had take pictures in 1976, 1998, and in 2001 but all of those pictures are on cameras that make pictures blury and in order to see if the picture was actually a face they had to do something to make that picure clearer than it shows.  As you can see i have some good reasons on why you should not make it mandatory, but if you feel like students need to provide more community service then use some of my ideas. As a student i think that if use you use at least one of those ideas that i stated then more students would join.  Of course they would be turned off in class as they should. There are so many reasons that we use phones as much as we do and taking them away will cause a tension like no other. The good outweighs the bad in this situation for many reasons and I am prepared to prove that.  If you haven't dealt with something much then it will be very useful to get advice and opinions from multiple people who have dealt with your problem before. You should ask numerous people about their past experiences to find out what worked best for them. All of that will help you come to a decision that will hopefully work out. Humans who have more knowledge on your subject will be wiser and can give you a lot of important input to think about when it comes to making a choice. I personally like to talk to my parents about issues because they know much more than I do and usually make the right choices. ",

                "content": "Why is it more beneficial to seek multiple opinions when making a decision? When people ask for advice, they are usually conflicted about something, or don't know what to do. The reason that one person asks for advice could be because they don't know what shoes to wear, or it could be because they need advice about something bigger, like what house to buy. Either way, they are still seeking other people's opinions. When you are asking a person for advice, you want a definite answer. You could ask one person for advice about what shoes to wear, and they could say black, and then you could ask someone else for advice about the same thing, and they could say a different answer.  Do you want your advice to help you make the best choice? When people ask for advice, they tend to ask more than one person because they want to make the better choice for themselves. People who want to make the best choice look for credibility, different ideas, and different views, and they do this by asking many different kinds of people from young to old, people from different countries, and more. They want as much opinions as possible so they can narrow it down to one idea that will help them make the best choice. For example, a student might be researching about the Civil War for their history paper. They might ask their history teacher for ideas because their teacher happens to be history major. The student decides to ask their parents about their views and ideas and it just so happens that they are both professors with a PhD\u00a0in history. The student gathers all the opinions they got and writes the paper and gets an A. The student knew they were going to pass because they asked people who were experts on history, and listened to their different views and ideas.  when people ask for advice, talking to more than one person can help you make the better choice. You can learn how to make the better choice most suitable for yourself when you talk to people who may have more experience and wisdom than you, and more people will be able to give their own ideas and inputs into the situation to help you look at the decision to be made in many different ways and perspectives. Finally, asking many people what they would do in the same scenario tells you if there might be a clear majority leaning towards one choice. Having a clear majority lets you know that this is what most people would do in the same situation, which leads you to feeling more comfortable and confident after making that decision. Though many people have to make difficult decisions throughout their lives, asking more people for advice in this decision will lead them into making the right one for themselves.  Have you ever asked someone for advice? If yes, then you know it can be a good thing. Asking for advice means to get other people's take on different options and seeing others choices. For example, teenagers ask for advice on their Instagram photos and their outfits all of the time. It helps them decide what they want to post or wear. Also, just know that there are no strict rules on how or what to ask advice for either, it is a very casual thing  People often overlook important details while creating an idea or making a choice, but when they ask for advice the people they ask can help them identify their flaw. For example, when people are planning a party they might forget to choose the kind of cake they are going to buy. When they ask a peer for advice their peer can point out their mistake, or the person planning the party will talk through their plan with the individual they asked for advice from and realize their flaw. Many mistakes will be avoided by people seeking for advice.  To be more specific, if none of the advice given is liked, then new ideas begin to spark. For instance, someone is deciding whether to buy a big box of cookies or not and they ask two people for advice. One person says to buy it, and the other says not to. If neither idea sounds right, the idea to buy a smaller box surfaces which is both pieces of advice combined. If only one piece of advice was taken then, the decision could have been completely different and had a different consequence.  From my experience of failure from my school project, I learned that even though you think your idea sounds good, you should still be open to improvement.  My decision on buying something I wanted taught me opportunity cost.  From asking people for advice, you can learn may valuable things that will assist you.  Not only do these decisions affect a singular situation, but they can be applied to life very easily.  Now, if I am interested in purchasing anything, I always weigh the options, and ask others what the best thing to do would be.  I learned that skill from asking people for advice.  These are the lessons that are learned first hand.  You do not just read them in a book, but instead, you are taught by experience and others.  For example, if a teacher was buying a new car, they would want to spend as much time as possible researching for the best car they could buy. However, even if they spent that much time, they could still end up buying a car that they end up not liking. Although if they asked others for advice, others may be able to share things from their own experience. They may have owned the car that the teacher wanted previously. If the teacher asked them whether it was a good purchase or not, they could share things that the teacher would have never found on the internet. Now the teacher has learned a lot more and has more information to make the right decision. That is why when others share their ideas, it could help someone make a better choice.  This is good for the person who is asking advice, because the person can look at the problem in all different ways, and see which solution best fits their personal needs and goals. This is better because what makes sense to one person, might not make sense to another person. As they say, nobody knows someone better than them self, which applies to someones problems. Hearing different points of views will also allow someone to see which point of view is the most popular opinion, and they can make their decision based off of what most people agree on.  When a person asks for advice it is most likely they're in a situation that is to confusing or difficult to the point where they don't know what the right solution or choice is. Making choices in life can be hard. Most times they'res never a right choice, but having different people to talk to help you find the best decision. ",

                "content": "under the electoral college system, voters vote not for president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president. a dispute over the outcome of an elecoral college vote is possible, it happend in 200 but, its less likely than a dispute over the popular vote. The reason is that the winning candidate's share of the electoral college invariably exceeds his share of the popular vote. The electoral college requires a presidential candidate to have transregional appeal.  \"Under the Electoral College system, voters vote not for President, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the President.\" The sitation before states that it is not the President the voters are voting for, it is actually the electors that the people are voting for, who in turn will vote for the President. This situation does not allow for the people to directly vote for who they believe will be the best President.  That is in the second paragraph and it really gets my attention, \"Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for the slate of electors, who in turn elect the president.\" With this in mind it is telling us the people that we are not voting for the president at all that is what most people believe that they are doing so you are kind of lying to some of them.  \"Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president.\" (Bradford Plumer). The public is starting to not like that their vote is not directly going toward the presidential vote but towards a group of electors that decide the fate of the presidency. \"the Electoral College method is not emocratic in a modern sense.\" (Richard A Posner). The public is also starting to feel that this is not a true Democracy with this system. \"Consider that state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors, and that those electors could always defy the will of the people.\" (Bradford Plumer). The public is starting to not like that feeling that the electors can just turn on the public and not vote for what some people want (and it has happened a few times in the past). \"'faithless' electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please.\" (Bradford Plumer). That is another worry of the public, no matter what party the elector belongs to, they can vote for anyone they want. \"Perhaps most worrying is the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote. In that case, the elcetion would be thrown to the House of Representatives, where state delegations vote on the president.\"(Bradford Plumer). The people are also not liking the fact that an elector representing a small amount of people has as much to say as an elector representing millions of people. All and all, it is hard to deny that there are a few problems with the electoral college and that this causes the public to worry come election time.  im writting this letter to you so you consider changing to election by popular vote for the prsident of the united states instead of electoral college. i belive like branford plumer, that the electoral college is very wrong not only because under the electoral college system, voters dont vote for the president but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president. but also because it is very unfair to voters, candidates dont spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the \"swing\" states.  In the article, \"The Indefensible Electoral College: Why event the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong,\" Bradford Plumer quotes, \"Under the electoral college sytem, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president.\" This is not how a republic is supposed to run. People are supposed to be granted the opportunity to elect the president of their choice, not of somebody elses. The most popular vote would take into consideration of every citizen's opinion with a direct percentage of votes to elect a certain candidate. In the article, \"In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President,\" Richard A. Posner states, \"The Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal. No region (South, Northeast, etc.) has enough electoral votes to elect a president.\" This may be true but if the most popular vote system was put into place, there would be an even more exact number of how many people voted for each candidate. The Electoral College does not voice the opinions of all citizens because in reality, a person is not directly voting for their desired candidate. They are voting for other representatives that will hopefully, in turn, elect the candidate they want. Obviously, the Electoral College is definitely a system that should be abolished in the United States of America.  \"Under the electorial college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president.\" (Paragraph 10). In actuality, voters don't directly vote for the president when it comes to the electoral college. Although the Electoral College \"restores some of the weight in the polititcal balance that large states lose by virtue of mal-apportionment\", (paragraph 21) voters don't have the right to control whom their electors are said author Bradford Plumer. Voting for a group of electors doesn't always mean that they'll vote for the candidate in which you favor. This can have a huge affect on the reputation of the Electoral College itsself.  He elaborates further to say that \"Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the presidet, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president. This proves my point further, because once again we do not vote for our president, we vote for the people who get the \"priveledge\" to vote for the most prestine place of power in our entire country.  What i mean is \"Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but the slate of electors, who in turn elect the president.\" Americans have always wanted to be in power and have a say in what we do but in the case of voting we do not. By doing this we are allowing the government to make all of the decisions for us, as if we were children. When you turn to the legal age for vothing your vote should count. With this majority does not rule, for instance say our votes of 46 percent and 54 percent were to come in. The man of the 46 percent still has a chance of winning when the people had already voted. The problem with that is at that point the peoples word goes out the window, and the government once again jumps in demanding that they choose.  Under the Electoral College voters vote not for the president but for a slate of electors, who in return elect the president. In reality the people are not voting for the president they are putting their trust in somebody they vote to vote for the person they have choose to lead ",

                "content": "Also some kids have disabilities or mental disabilities that cause problems when they are trying to do activities like football or yearbook club.  These disabilities cause some kids to have trouble with school work, focusing, and completing simple tasks such as writing with a pencil. This is why it would not be beneficial to force these kids to do extracurricular activities. The rigorous work of clubs like a math club, a yearbook club, or a reading club would overstimulate some of these kids. It would lead to tantrums, fits, and bad behavior from some of these kids, and it would distract the other club members from their work. Extracurricular activities like baseball or football would not be beneficial for them either because some of these kids with disabilities have trouble throwing a ball, standing up straight, and walking if it is a serious case. While it is not a bad thing for kids with disabilities or mental disabilities to join a club or sport, it is just harder for some of them to do extracurricular\u00a0activities because of their underlying issues.  When considering whether or not to allow children to participate in sports or other activities without an average above a C, what one must remember is that everyone has their own strengths and weaknesses. Yes, many people excel in academics, but there are others, who math and science just don't click with them. By saying these more athletically inclined individuals cannot participate in their medium, you take away one of their great pleasures. Some kids get a rush when they find out they aced their midterm, but others take greater pleasure in scoring the winning touchdown or participating in a club where you help others.  Sports and activities are a passion for people that runs through their veins like nobody's business. So, what would be the benefit of the school taking that away? Nothing. Children get involved in activities because they love it and they would rather do nothing else. If we strip them from that then what else do they have to cause them to be ambitious in life? It's hard to tell but we know they wont have a passion.  This is why I believe kids should not be forced to participate in extracurricular activities because while they are beneficial they are hard for some. Extracurricular activities cause issues for parents and kids with no time, and in some cases they force kids with disabilities to do things they cannot do. For example, some parents have work from 8 am until 7 pm and this would not allow any time for drop off and pick up. Also kids have a lot\u00a0of homework, opening up little time for kids to do extracurricular activities. Lastly some kids with disabilities and mental disabilities just\u00a0don't have the capacity to participate in extracurricular activities. Many say that extracurricular activities should be required, but I feel forcing all kids to do them is wrong  Some say that sports cause kids to not focus on school as much and that by forcing them to have higher grades before they can join you get immediate results,  Having a C average is still passing and that's what we should contemplate on, not a B average. If we eliminate the sport activity from the child it wont benefit them  Some kids go home and play sports outside or play a game with their siblings, but most kids go home and play video games for 5 hours till they have to eat dinner or go to bed. This is very unhealthy. An extracurricular activity would get a person who usually plays lots of video games to do something active. They could play sports after school and they would still have time for video games. Playing sports after school could convince them to play sports for fun, not because they have to do something after school and they could join a league and exercise more than just after school. This would help kids stay active and healthy. After school activities for all people is a good idea because it would help kids stay active and healthy.  Staying involved in physical activity has proven to improve test scores and health for that matter. The health of my classmates should be very important to you considering that a sick student cannot attend class. Kids with excess energy will not pay attention and that is why sports teams and physical activities are incorporated in every school. Taking that away from kids with a lower average than a B will not improve their grades or help them gain knowledge, instead their grades will most likely start declining more with the short attention spans in class. Therefore, decreasing the knowledge that they take in and making them less knowledgeable.  You can tell them that not all after school activities are sports related, and so instead of making your kids play sports try letting them pick what they want to do. There are so many good clubs and organizations to join in school so why not take advantage of it? For example you could join the yearbook committee or join student council, there are so many options we could keep going forever. Now what if your child does not like any of the extracurricular activities? Schools are great places to try new things, just because your child has never done something before does not mean they won't necessarily like it. So before you jump the gun and say you child does not like something maybe let them explore their options first. ",

Many students could be interested in doing this, and sometimes if it's not in school and they don't hear of it. They can never find it.  According to the article \"Making Mona Lisa Smile,\" there is a new technology called the Facial Action Coding System (FACS) that enables computers to identify human emotions. This technology is relatively brand new. It creates a 3-D computer model of all fourty-four major muscles in the face that move like human muscles as well. Then, psychologists have classified six basic emotions that are associated with different movements in the facial mucles. This new technology could result in many benefits in our community as well as all around the world  The human body has way more than just six emotions so getting a high accuracy reading on how you are really feeling is out of the question because FACS uses the a process of a 3-D model Dr. Huang states \"The process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D model of the face; all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles.\" This quote explains that it has to use a way of making a model which can sometimes take some time depending on the processing power of the computer not only that but human emotions can change quite quickly and if the pc doesnt make the model fast enough the computer can easly fail at getting and accuarate reading.  Emotion is in the brain, not the heart. The way the FACS understands emoion is simple. It maps out a 3-D model of the face, looks at the shape and positoin of all the muscles, then it associates the different facial movements with differet emotion. For example, your orbicularis oris (muscles around your mouth) tighten your lips to show when you are angry. It even works when a person it trying to mask emotions. During a fake smile, the zygomatic major stretches the mouth sidways, while in a real smile the zygomatic major lifts the corners of the mouth. These examples can show how science IS able to understand emotoin, probaly better than most humans. Arguments that use that falshood, that science is unable to understand emotion, is completly false.  This new software could be innovative for the way classrooms work in the future. If students could be educated the way they would want to be educated, yet still get the knowledge they need to succeed, then the future generation could be unstoppable. In paragraph 9 it states that \"making faces can reveal so much about the science of emotions.\" There are no limits to what the next generation can do if it all starts with teachers being able to read the emotions of their students. The future starts here with this idea, and this software.  Dr. Huang is talking about the device using video images to pick up the emotions of each person. Dr. H states \"using video imagery, The new emotion recognition software tracks these facial movments in a real face or on a painted face.\" This quote brings to light that the machine can read emotions but one could say since it is still in new development that not all of the bugs or glitches have been worked out not only that but you also have to devote more resources to keep the machine working which can average to be a heafty hit to your wallet.  Driverless cars require sensors which allow them to mimic human reaction to whatever situation might arise while on the road. Sensor technology has been in development and in use since the 1980s, with the introduction of antilock brakes. Using this technology, Google modified a Toyota Prius with several sensors which allows the car to access a 3-D model of its environment. The proper technology to introduce driverless cars is clearly already available to manufacturers. In fact, in 2013, BMW announced the \"Traffic Jam Assistant,\" which allows the car to steer, accelerate, and brake itself. The world is already well on its way to the creation of a truly driverless car.  Beginning from the late 1950s, the concept of the driverless car was already thought of. Now, the concept is beginning to come to fruition due to the advanced technology created. The most important bit of technology on the driverless car is the spinning sensor on the roof, also known as the LIDAR. The LIDAR is able \"to form a constantly updating 3-D model of the car's surroundings.\" Without the LIDAR, the accuracy of the driverless car would be greatly reduced as the car would have no sense of its surroundings. Another technology that was greatly enhanced is the antilock brakes. In the 1980s, the antilock brakes \"used speed sensors at the wheels\" to monitor when the car was becoming out of control. Back then, the antilock brakes only had a sensor to monitor the wheel's speed. Now, the antilock brakes have become more advanced to the point that they are able to \"detect and respond to the danger of out-of-control skids or rollovers.\" The antilock brakes have evolved from only having a sensor that monitors speed to sensors that can detect many dangerous conditions. The advancement of car technology greatly affects how safe and successful a driverless car may be. A driverless car would most likely not be able to work in the 1980s with the speed sensor as the antilock brakes. Now, the driverless car would be able to work very effectively as it combines a plethora of sensors and cameras to ensure safety.  Students may also use this feature in art classes to really capture what the artist was depicting in the work. For instance, this new software was able to create percentages of Mona Lisa's emotions. The latest innovation in computer software may be very useful for art classes, knowing how a person may be feeling in a painting may help students to depict the artists work, a bit better. As humans, we can tell how someone may be feeling by the look on their face, or the look in their eyes. Most of us would have trouble trying to describe what facial expressions convey being happy, besides a smile. The computer can make exact percentages on each emotion you may be feeling.  Initially, the thought of additional advancement of technology is frightening. Predicting ideas is not always a sure way of indicating what will occur. However, after Dr. Huang introduces and explains his new concept of Facial Action Coding System Technology, it is arduous to reject the placement of this software into everyday life. Hopefully, the program will be installed soon so it can start making improvements in various industries across the board. ",

This shows that they have seen things like this before and they knew that it wasn't real, or alien like. Another example that the author proves is that Garvin said it reminded him of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. The camera on board MGS had to peer through wispy clouds to see the face and perhaps alien markings were hidden by haze. Also NASA can be hidding information about the Face. But, you can see that the Face is formed by shadows, and not an alien haze.  So in conclusion it is not a alien made face it simply in a mesa or a landmark on Mars. The proof is in the article when you see the 3 picutes that were taken to prove it wasn't a alien made artifact. No matter how cool it would be if it was not to mention that it could make NASA famous or rich it just doesn't have the proof you need to be a alien artifact. If you look more into the passage it even says it was not a alien made artiffact. Yes this face was very famous it even says \"The \"Face\" on Mars has since been a pop icon. It has starred in a Hollywood film, apperered in books, magazines, and even radio shows.\" (5). See how famous that face was 25 years ago is amazing but it still doesn't mean it was a alien made artiffact. So in final say it is not a alien made face and nor will there be enough proof its just a landmark on Mars that was very popular to people everywhere!            I find it highly unrealistic that NASA would even have been able to determine what the Face was forty years ago, much less hiding a discovery of extra-terrestrial life that could make a huge profit for the space program. And, had NASA really claimed that the Face was an object built by otherworldly life, surely someone would let the cat out of the bag. Not to mention that, if the vast majority of NASA believed it was an alien monument, do you really think that they would wait eighteen years to investigate the subject again? On top of all of this, it's simply illogical that aliens would create such a thing. As far as we all know, the supposed \"aliens\" on Mars have never come in contact with a human, much less seen one. That only leaves possible explanation; aliens created a monument that of which coincedentally resembles a human head. An absolute coincedence.  With all of the technology used to investigate the red planet, proof of alien life should have already been found. Jim Garvin, chief scientist for NASA's Mars Exploration Program explained, \"As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size...So, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!\" By stating this, Garvin is saying that if there was any evidence of aliens builing this face on Mars, it would have been found.  In conclusion, some people may think there is alien life on Mars because of past picture or conspiracy theories. No one can denty however, that NASA has proven the Face to be nothing but a natural landform on the Red Planet Mars. NASA has proven this by recent pictures, scientific evidence, and real-life examples and measurements. Over the years, NASA has worked hard to figure out the mystery of the face, and just recently they have discovered, with pictyures, evidence, and measruements, that the Face is just a natural landform with unusual shadowing formed on the Red Planet Mars.  Those who believe in aliens building the face on Mars might srgue that NASA is secretly holding evidence that there theories are correct.  So, while some conspiracy theorists would like to think that aliens created this well-known face on Mars, they are incorrect. The face on Mars is just a natural landform that was wrongly perceived by the public. By advancing in digital technology, understanding the effect of shadows, and realizing that there is no evidence to support aliens on Mars, it can be concluded that the face on Mars is just another peculiar natural landform.  First and foremost, if these photos of the alleged face were the work of possible Martians, NASA would have found further evidence by now.  In 1976 the face looked like a face. In 1998 it started to not look like a face at all. In 2001 it just looked like a rock. So i believe that it was not created by aliens but that it was just something the olanet had made itself. This has certainly got the attention of the people.  The \"Face on Mars\" is not a face. If you look at the pictures from 1976, and 1998, and 2001 and in the text it says that the photo from 2001 is the most recent photo that NASA has. It still looks nothing like a face so since the 2001 picture is the most recent it shows that it is just a natural landform. It is just a natural landform. On Mars there are natural landforms everywhere and the fade away. Here on earth natural landforms are created everyday.  Conspiracy theorist were fast to make speculations that this was ancient alien architecture or something of the sort. But NASA said that the face was just a geograghical coincidence, and there is no alien stucture on Mars. ",

                "content": "The article states that the technology associates each emotion with \"characteristic movements of the facial muscles\" and then uses those movements to calculate the spectrum of emotions based on their facial display. But some people show emotions in various ways, and the technology most likely cannot accomodate for the many different ways people express the same emotion. For example, if a student has a resting face that seems generally happy, the system might confuse this dazed face as a satisfied face and think that the student is happy with their lessons when they are actually confused or not paying attention. In the same way, if a student has a resting face that looks naturally sad, the system may think they are unhappy with their lessons, even if the student feels they are learning a lot. A lot of students also try to hide their emotions, like frusteration or sadness, with a happier look on their face, and even though the article states that the system can detect a \"false smile\", it cannot always be accurate as a person may be good at hiding their emotions and displaying a genuine smile. Therefore, since technology is not always accurate and because human beings are so various in the way they behave, the technology would not be useful in a classroom where it may misread a student's state of mind and lead them in the wrong path of education.  Emotion is in the brain, not the heart. The way the FACS understands emoion is simple. It maps out a 3-D model of the face, looks at the shape and positoin of all the muscles, then it associates the different facial movements with differet emotion. For example, your orbicularis oris (muscles around your mouth) tighten your lips to show when you are angry. It even works when a person it trying to mask emotions. During a fake smile, the zygomatic major stretches the mouth sidways, while in a real smile the zygomatic major lifts the corners of the mouth. These examples can show how science IS able to understand emotoin, probaly better than most humans. Arguments that use that falshood, that science is unable to understand emotion, is completly false.  We can learn about our human bodies and why emotion is displayed so easily, and how it's displayed as well. \"According to the Facial Feedback Theory of Emotion, moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions, but also may even help produce them.\" Our faces can move in multiple ways depending on the emotion we feel, as shown in paragraphs 7-8. Why does it do this? This technology can give us a valid reason to talk about the science of emotion more, and we can learn more about this as students or even as teachers.  Leonardo Da Vinci was one of the greatest reniassance painters of the time. His study of the human anatomy allowed him to create pictures that captured the humna state. On of his most well known paintings is the \"Mona Lisa\". The Mona Lisa is a women that has sort of complacent facial features. She doesn't really look happy or sad. This was the popular thought up until a new technology was created. This technology is called the Facial Action Coding System. This technology is able to deduce what emotion a person is feeling. It is able to do this whothout the person even showing an obvious emotion. This technology can also be implenmented in many spheres of life, including in the classroom.  New technology is being introduced to mankind almost every second in this world, and now, the latest techonology is a computer program called the Facial Action Coding System which can identify a person's emotions. The question is whether this technology is actually valuable and for what it could be used for. Experts suggest this technology could be used in a classroom to identify the state of mind of a student to adjust the lesson they are trying to comprehend. But, even though this technology may be helpful to teachers trying to keep students active and engrossed in their lessons, the question arises of whether this techonlogy is actually worth the recources or whether what experts think is a great idea is actually an invasion of privacy.  So now what do you think? Computers advance more and more everyday, however facial recognition may just be the beginning. Learning in classroom has become based on all technology in many different forms. Facial tachnology will broaden our horizons with better test scores and happier students that can understand the material evn better than before! The use of technology to read the emotional expressions of the students in a classroom could be a life changing improvement in the 21st century since every student has different wants and needs as far their education.  It is no secret that many students dread coming to school, whether it be from stress, bullying, or simply not understanding the subjects. This system can pick up on a fake emotion, the author explains how it can read a \"fake smile\" and that to them \"faces don't lie\" (para. 8). If this system is able to sense when a student is unhappy or angry, this could be used as an advantage in helping the student. Not only this, but the author explains that \"moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions, but may even help produce them\" (para. 9). Taking both of these statements into account, and allowing them to be incorporated into the classroom, students may enjoy attending school and learning new things.  Dr. Huang is talking about the device using video images to pick up the emotions of each person. Dr. H states \"using video imagery, The new emotion recognition software tracks these facial movments in a real face or on a painted face.\" This quote brings to light that the machine can read emotions but one could say since it is still in new development that not all of the bugs or glitches have been worked out not only that but you also have to devote more resources to keep the machine working which can average to be a heafty hit to your wallet.  In the third passage of the artice, the author states, \"Eckman has classified six basic emotions-happiness ... and then associated each with charactersitic movements of the facial muscles,\" meaning that the software associated voluntary or involuntary movements of the face with emotions. The problem with this system is that students can change the look of their face quite easily, and can thus convince the computer to produce desired results, making the system disfunctional. There are quite a few reasons children, especially young ones, would want to make the software not work, including tricking the computer into moving from the original learning program into a more desired one and them simply wanting to see the program fail through their abilities.  There's a new kind of technology called Facial Action Coding System, or FACS, which enables computers to identify human emotions. The use of this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is very valuable ",

Transitioning to errors, a common theme of accident tragedies is the one where a person is texting and driving leading to distractions that cause the accident. This is not the only cause of accidents, though, as humans are not made to be perfect, small errors also cause accidents, but despite the wide range of things that may cause an accident, driverless cars can cover a person for that as well.  For example, in February 2018, a 17 year old in Alabaster, Alabama killed a ten year old and her father in an accident because the teen was texting while driving. If the teen would have been paying attention to the road and not their phone the accident maybe could have been prevented. Not saying all accidents are caused by phone use, but a majority of them are.  Many cannot focus fully on the road and the other vehicles, if one keeps talking on phone consistently while driving. This is what leads to fatal accidents. People may think they can multitask while conducting a vehicle and using their cellular devices but in reality that is not the case. Studies show that no matter how concentrated you may think you are, you cause an accident. Whether it's you hitting something small, making others get into an accident, or yourself hitting another car.  It seems to me that it may or will cause alot more accidents than texting while driving or drinking while driving.  Every day, every hour, every minute as we continue with our life's a car accident occurs due to someone using their phone. Using your cell phone while driving is a big no.  One of them are getting sent to a different location. Just like G.P.S., you type in your address and sometimes it sends you somewhere you didn't want to go. A Driverless Car is like a driving G.P.S., it could also have a malfunctioning problem it could put your life at risk and others.  The reasoning behind this is when the driver takes their attention away from the road, the dangerousness of the situation increases by 400%. During the time the driver looks down at their phone to check a message, read the GPS, or receive a phone call, an accident can occur. Therefore, to prevent any accidents, all distractions must be eliminated, such as cellular devices. Moreover, by eliminating all distractions, the safety of everyone on the road is increased   Everyday there's always someone whose severely injured or either worst end up dead because of the use of using their phone while operating a vehicle of any kind.  The reason for that is because you're looking at a wide variety of answers rather than from one person. You'd get a broader knowledge of the subject, and you probably don't have to ask again. The information is likely more accurate since it came from multiple people. One single person could accidentally give you the wrong information causing a possible bad outcome. For example, there are many wars caused accidentally just because one person made a minor communication error. ",

The guidelines help me determine what material I need to research and how much of it. Sometimes it might even be that I dont know what kind of product I am making to convey that said research. This not only provides lack of a acceptable project but also not giving good guidelines gives unwanted stress towards the student. For example some students I know worry that their project is not good enough to meet the expectations\u00a0of the teacher, or that they are not doing the work that is wanted. Giving guidelines will provide less stress for the student and with that a better outcome with their project.  The students need to have the teachers and society's trust to exceed what is expected of them because society will never know what these students are capable of if they are never given an opportunity to prove themselves. This will better the generations reputation if done correctly.   While some teacher designed assignments benefit the students by learning factual information that will benefit them over the first two weeks of school, student designed reports would enable teachers and students to have a better academic relationship over the course of the entire school year. By exposing the students to the style, rigor, and expectations of the class, students will know what they are getting themselves into far better than if they were to read and annotate a book that is relevant for the better half of a month. Students would also give future students the ability to practice their skills if they so choose to do so; preparing future students for the essay styles of rhetorical analysis, document based questions, and free response questions that are synonymous with the AP brand. Because of these reasons, teacher designed assignments holds a dim candle to the flaming torch of student designed assignments that would benefit future classes throughout the entire year.  Some people may claim that giving students the ability to design their own project is not \"giving\" but \"forcing\". Students may need guidelines in order to work properly and receive a fair grade for their effort. Or worst case, they simply won't do the work. If a student needs a step-by-step process on how to recount their learning, then how will they expect to fend for themselves once they graduate?  In conclusion, I believe that this is a very fair and reasonable policy. It will force kids to work out to their full potential, and they will have better grade point averages. The students must fully accept their responsibilty to live up to this potential so that the students, faculty, and coaches will be satisfied with the students.  Having being said, student designed projects are better for both the student and the teacher. It allows students to have more freedom and personalize their studies with their occupation. Teachers will also have the chance to determine the students personality and see what the student is like. It shows how bright a student's mind can be and how well their work ethics are. Teachers should give students a chance to show off themselves and appreciate for what they are able to achieve in. It can also be a fun learning experience for many. Not only will these student-designed projects continue their learning throughout break, it will also preserve any sort of creativity a student could withhold.\u00a0   \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  Suppose a teacher assigns a project with specific guidelines and one topic to develop a solution to. This may make the expectations for the student clear-cut, but this type of project learning limits students in what they can explore. With the ability to design your own project, students learn how to research various topics before deciding on the one they will come up with a project to. Not only does this contribute to the development of enhanced research skills among students, but it prepares them for research in the future. In pursuing higher levels of education, it is crucial that students are knowledgeable on how to research about topics efficiently and accurately. Thus, those research skills are developed from student-designed projects and they benefit current and future educational advancement.  For example, at home, a student may be tempted to watch television, or take a nap as there is no teacher or administrator to effectively enforce certain rules and guidelines on the student. This situation makes a student's ability to stay on task extremely difficult, hence negatively impacting that student's success academically. However, if the student were taking classes at school, they are required, by the teacher, to focus on the lesson and complete tasks in a timely manner for their grade. Taking classes at home allows a student to procrastinate their assignments, with no tangible consequence. Because of this, distance learning allows students to take advantage of their freedoms at home, which, in the long run, has a unfavorable effect on that student's academic success.  Teachers are the best fit to design summer assignments for students because, unlike teens with only fun and relaxation on their minds who would not take the project seriously, teachers can create an assignment that will prepare the student for the specified curriculum and demonstrate what they expect from them. This should have tremendous benefits when it comes to student preparedness, class switches, and student success.  This will give the students structure and something to base their project on instead of having all the options in the world and not being able to choose one. In school, students are normally more prepared if it is a topic they have been learning about and have background knowledge on compared to a project half way through a topic, or even towards the beginning. If students are given a short book or even a PowerPoint on the topic at hand they will be more successful in completing their project. ",

This was soon to be known as the \"Face on Mars\".   Probably the most obvious piece of evidence that busts the idea of unknown life, is that these photos were taken in 1976 (according to paragraph 5 of Unmasking the Face on Mars) . Technology at that time was still fairly primitive, especially for space travel.  The first picture that was taken of the face on Mars was taken in 1976 and the quality back then was not as good as it is now. The picture that was taken in 2001 was a higher quality picture and scientists figured out that is was just a mesa and not a sign of any ancient civilization on Mars. For example the camera used in 1976, spanned 43 meters compared to the camera NASA used in 2001 spanned 1.56 meters. In the picture of 1976, the shadows that were present that day formed an illusion that made it seem like there was a face. In paragraph two of the article \"Unmasking the Face on Mars\" it says that, \"Scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia, only this one had unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh.\"  When the face on Mars was originally captured, there was no such thing. The article explains that when the picture was originally captured in 1976, the camera quality was not great. For example the text states, \"Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo.\" So, when given a better camera quality than in 1976, the face on mars no longer looks like a defined face. Although the quality of the camera is a great support, there are many other explanations that put an end to conspiracy theorists.  In 1976, the Viking 1 spacecraft was orbiting the planet of Mars, and it was taking new pictures for all of mankind to see. As it was passing over a strip of Mars called Cydonia, it snapped a picture that would cause an uproar in space exploration. This new picture showed what seemed to be a human face. A few days later NASA reveled these pictures for the world to see; it was an instant hit  n paragraph 10 it says,\" ...43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo.\" This shows that the photo didn't give very compelling evidence that there was life on Mars. soon later NASA and their supporters claimed that this face is just an act of nature is because of the 1998 Global Surveyor spacecraft. This new spaceship passed over the red planet to take pictures of the \"face on Mars\". The pictures were ten times better than the last pictures of Cydonia this time. The new photos clearly showed a landform on Mars and not a man.  Both seem to resemble a simple mesa, a natural landform quite common on Mars. The 1998 photograph was slightly blurry, so three years later Michael Malin and his crew returned to the Red Planet, to the Cydonia region. Mr. Malin set the Mars Global Surveyor camera to maximum resolution, and snapped an excellent picture from above the Face. And, going even further, I will point out that each pixel in the 2001 photograph spans1.56 meters, as the Viking I's 1976 photo spans 43 meters per pixel. As you can see, this is a significant difference and must not be overlooked.  The Apollo 11 mission was just seven years old! To attach a high-powered camera to a space shuttle was very challenging at the time. I still hold to my belief that, during the 1976 mission, it was either the fault of the Viking I for holding a bad angle for the camera and causing blurriness, or the camera's fault for simply not being powerful enough. The 1976 photo spans just 43 meters per pixel, which at the time was a very high resolution, but now is considered very low. All in all, the Viking I photo of the Face on Mars is forty years old and must not be taken as seriously as it once was.  In 1976 NASA released a photo of a landform on Mars resembling a human face. Not everyone was easily convinced that it was only just a landmass though. Conspiracy theorists believed that it was, \"Bona fide evidence of life on Mars.\" In the article \"Unmasking the Face on Mars,\" the author, Garvin, believed that it was only a mesa.  Like we said during this speech we said that \"And so on April 5, 1998, when Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing... a natural landform.\" Later on we did it again in the speech \"Nevertheless, on April 8, 2001- a cloudless summer day in Cydonia- Mars Global Surveyor drew close enough for a second look. \"We had to roll the spacecraft 25 degrees to center the Face in the field of view,\" Said Garving. \"Malin's team captured an extraordinary photo using the camera's absolute maximum resolution.\" \"Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo.\" Now you may say that we never did that, but we have photographic evidence of that clear photo that lets you see everything on the face. So we have the evidence we need to prove that this photo is real. ",

Venus has temperatures over 800 degress Fahrenheit, an atmospheric pressure 90 times greater than that on Earth, erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and other obstacles that prove challenging for scientists to overcome. Additionally, Venus has clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in the atmosphere which prove to be challenging to scientists. These dangers may seem impossible to overcome, but scientists have been developing new methods to further their knowledge of Venus.   There are many dangers on Venus, including sulfuric acid rain and an atmosphere of nintey seven percent carbon dioxide. Hovering over it would be useless. In paragraph six, it states, \"... peering at Venus from a ship orbiting or hovering safely far above the planet can provide only limited insight on ground conditions because most forms of light cannot penetrate the dense atmosphere, rendering standard forms of photography and videography ineffective.\" This states that by hovering on top of the planet, they can't learn anyting they don't already know.

On Venus, the temperature alone could liquify many metals and completely destroy spacecrafts that were sent there. Also, the pressure of the atmosphere could crush a submarine fit for diving to the deepest parts of the ocean.

He explains, \" On the planet's surface, the temperature averages over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet.\" Considering that this is true, we can definitrly assume that condition on Venus are severly dangerous, and a lot of people may get hurt trying to explore it. The aurthor also states, \" These conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth; such an environment would crush even a submarine accustomed to diving to the deepest parts of our oeans and would liquefy many metals. What the author is stating here is that not even our strongest materials and creations can withstand the conditions on Venus. This means that in order to explore Venus we have to design all new machinery, which would cost a lot of money, not to mention the human costs as we would need humans to test things out. He also makes it notable that venus has the hottest surface of any planet, despite not being the closest to the sun. All of these facts are serious concerns when regarding human safety as well as propr functioning of machines. Even if exploring Venus was a possibilty, would it be even be worth it after all of he human costs and money costs or paid. What we are discussing here is putting human lives at risk, and spending a ton of money on a project that is no where near being ready ready to present. These reasons as well as the provided facts assure me on my claim that the author did a terrible job of supporting this idea of exploration.  The author demonstrates how the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents by explaining many supporting reasons. They make it obvious that Venus is indeed safe to visit under the right precautions and that, with all the facts provided in paragraphs 4,5, and 6, it is a planet that us survivable for humans. The author supports thier standpoint fairly well with all the information they provided, even referencing NASA. This author fairly supports the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers.  The article mentions that \"A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent blankets Venus.\" As carbon dioxide is waste product of human respiration, the inhalation of this gas would be very dangerous for life to visit Venus. It also says that \"On the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Farenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet.\" Without shelter that can withold these extreme temperatures and amounts of pressure, the human body, similar to the spacecrafts, would be lucky to survive for more than a few hours. These numbers support the author's claim to focus on the horrific dangerous of exploring Venus to present a logical standpoint on this issue.  Overall, the author of \"The Challenge of Exploring Venus\" makes a claim that although Venus has some exceptionally dangerous conditions, it is a planet worth exploring. They support this claim very well by explaining the importance of going to Venus, and providing a few solutions that might reduce the risk factor of this type of mission. All in all, this author, much like Audrey Hepburn, proves through this article that they feel that nothing is truly impossible, not even a trip to Venus.  The author supports their claim by giving numerous details and supporting his ideas.\"Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endbeavors.\" A big issue that is brought up are the harsh conditions Venus brings. \"On the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Farenheight, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet.\" Knowing this, you might think that they must stop there with their research because there's no way they can discover Venus now because it's to dangerous and harsh. That is false, \"NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray.\" Their solution is to have a vehicle hovering over Venus that would avoid the unfriendly ground conditions by staying up and out of their way. It would still be toasty but not deathly. The author claims, \" Not easy conditions, but survivable for humans.\" The author supports his claim by saying yes, the temperature is a challenge they will face, but NASA has one particular compelling idea for sending humans to study Venus, and they will continue to challenge themselves and find solutions to these conflicts they face.  In \"The Challenge of Exploring Venus,\" the author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit depsite the dangers it presents. The author uses strong details to support this claim throughout the article. Facts and statistics by NASA and other reliable sources are used to back the claims. The author stands by the opinion that Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents.  The author describes the potential dangers that could result from studying Venus which contradicts their idea that the observations made through studying Venus overweigh the risks. ",

                "content": "In article one, paragraph 8, there is something that the governor does that maybe is supposed to reassure us. \"After the presidential election, your governor prepares a \"Cerificate of Ascertainment\" listing all of the candidates who ran for President in your state along with the names of their respective electors.\"\u00a0 This is just them saying who was all voted for and who all ran. It also says who the electors were. They give us this probably just to notify us but maybe it's also an idea to make us think that Electoral College is proud to help us get who we want.  As said in the article, \"What Is The Electoral College?\", \"The Electoral College process consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for President and Vice President, and the counting of the electoral votes by Congress.\" That is a huge amount of work but that is what keeps the elections well organized. Each candidate running for President in a state has their own group of electors. After each election, the governor of your state prepares a certificate presenting all of the candidates that ran for your state. As stated in the article by the Office of the Federal Register, \"The Certificate of Ascertainment also declares the winning presidential candidate in your state and shows which electors will represent your state at the meeting of the electors in December of the election year.\" The Electoral College is what mantains everything professional.  In the article  What Is The Electoral College by the office of the Federal Register, it states that the election process is held every four years along with the after election prepared by the govenor titled \"Certificate Of Ascertainment\" which sums the canadidates and electors as well as the winning canadidate. It is obvious that the voters only know so much of what they vote for and do not really get a good taste of how the presidential canadidate is like. It can be clear that as a blind election, the voters have no hints of who they might be voting towards and in the end can cause a major catasrophe if a canadidate has very little intentions for the states. In agreement to the article the text  In the defense of the electoral college by Richard A. Posner it begins to sate the election of Romney who, by increasing his plurality and possesing only regional appeal, lost the peoples desire to vote for him thinking that the man has no regards for their interest and does not have any intentions of improving their needs or helping with creating a community where the people can rely on Romney. The actions taken began to change the thoughts of the citizens and create a petrifying conclusion that the man was not on the run to be everyone's president. This dilema could have been changed around if Romney had shown that he had cared more for his state and his country and thought more about the needs he could fill and the actions he could improve, then many of the voters would have most likely shown repsect and a desire for the man to be choosen as their new president. On the opposing hand Romney had not shown any of those qualities or passion which had caused for him to be thought of as unresponisble and selfish.  The country has more than thousands and thousands of people to serve and direct. It can be understood that having a large amount of citizens can result in uncertainty towards the election and the votes cast, yet it is yet to be changed to a more reasonable way of confronting it. With many systems such as \"Winner-Take -All\" due to states titled as the \"Swing States,\" it can be an untrustworthy election fo rmany voters around the country. The election process not only need to be changed to select a more responsible canadidate, but to create a more trustworthy system of itself.   First of all we don't know who picks the electors. We don't know if there truthful as in putting in votes. I'm sure they have to have certain requirments to become an elector but we are not the ones chosing them. In the 2000 campaign 17 states didn't even see the people running in the election. Also in an Electoral College ties exist so then it has to be thrown into the House of Represenatives where the delagations will vote on the president. Making our votes worthless because the people in the goverment get to chose whos next to become president.   It is the morning after the election, the sun is shining, the birds are singing, and you are joyful as can be, Why?\u00a0 Last night's vote showed that your president that you wanted to win was going to be the next President of the United States of America.\u00a0 You go to your laptop, open the screen, and there, in bold letters it says that the candidate you did not want to win was sitting there in the Oval Office.\u00a0 You are in shock. Your friends call you and ask you what happened. Did something go wrong? Did we miss any extra votes last night?\u00a0 You go look at the votes, they are still the same.\u00a0 Then you relize that the Electoral College did not care what the people of this country said. The Electoral College did not care in one candidate had 100,000 more votes than the other.\u00a0 All they wanted is everything to go their way.   For example if there is a tie in the Electoral vote the election would be handed to the House of Representatives, where state delegations vote on the presedent. This wouldnt be fair because since each state casts only one vote, then the single representativ from Wyoming would only represent 500,000 voters. However the single representative from California would represent 35 million voters. That hardly seems fair.  A presidential candidate makes many a promise during their race for Chief Executive and there is no way to be completely certain that these oaths will hold true. The same goes for the Electoral College. Citizens must have faith in the candidate as they would in the presidential election that they will put their country or state before personal wants and carry out their responsibilities honestly. The Electoral College process requires trust like any other form of election.  This allows us to know which candidate has won the election on voting day. Keep in mind that when the electoral college was made, many citizens had no idea who had won often until the next year. The fact that we know immediatly is proof that the meeting of the Electoral college in December is completely unnessessary. And what if there is a tie in the elctoral vote, although we know what the popular vote is, we would still have to send the vote to congress.  What Is the Electoral College?\" states you are voting for electors when you vote, but what is the point if they can simply defy you? It would be like if after the president was chosen, the Senate could overule him with a 1/5 vote. There is also the point in Plumer's article about the time Hawaii sent two slates, which forced the desicion to Nixon, who had to validate only the opponet's votes in fear of otherwise receiving bad publicity. There is also the strange way of resolving a tie, which boils down to the same thing as the winner-take-all system, except if more people support\u00a0 it doesn't matter. It would be like if everybody in the\u00a0 room wasn't alowed to vote, other than one voted, but everybody in the room agreed anyway for some strange, miraculous reason. (Of course, the one guy in the\u00a0 next room doesn't agree, and completely takes out your vote, regardless of the fact that there were 30 people in this one.)  In this case, the election would be thrown to the House of representatives, were delegates from each state would vote on the president. Since each state has only one vote to cast, a vote from a state containing 500,000 people would carry the same weight as a vote representing the opinions of 35 million. Given that many voters vote one party for president and another for Congress, the selection made by the House of Represenatives can hardly be expected to respesent the will of the people.    ",

                "content": "Opposers might say that our votes don't even matter due to the fact that the popular vote doesn't directly determine our nation's President.  For example, as seen in the article, Republicans in California realize that their vote does not matter because Democrats tend to dominate in that state. The same can be said for Democrats in Texas who beleive their vote does not matter because Republicans dominate in that state. However, if the U.S had a popular vote, voters may think that there vote may mean more and will be encouraged to go out and vote for the President.  While the Electoral College may seem like a sure fire way to assure that we get a president, that doesn't really mean the majority wants that president. Think about it, we don't always get the president we voted for. Popular vote doesn't really matter, it's like saying you voice doesn't matter to the government.  Besides, the popular vote doesn't matter in the decision for president it elects members for the electoral college. So if I wanted to vote for a republican president but the electoral college ends up voting for the democrat I would have wasted my time going to vote. Clearly, the electoral college's vote overrules the popular vote.  their vote does not matter causing them to lose interest in voting in the first place. This is not fair for those people nor is it particularly good to express as an American trait.  The people's votes should matter because it is our country these choies\u00a0 affect. The electoral college method is discouraging some of the voters to vote.  Yet, the word 'rarely' still sticks, and not many can just simply deny that it is not there. The rest of the statment in paragraph 16 continues onto lines 4-6, \"[;however,] it is entirely possible that the winner of the electoral vote will not win the national popular vote.\" So in simple terms, you can get the electoral vote which can put you ahead, but you won't win with just that under your belt. The people still matter, and their vote can still count against you.  With over 300 million people now in the United States, under a unified country that promotes and exemplifies democracy, we have not been democratic in the sense that peoples vote doesnt even go to their president, only to another mind that can cast you away as if you were not important. As stated in Par. 7 Source 1 an article by the Office of the Federal Register \"Most states have a winner-take-all system that awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate.\" These are the minds that are sometimes chosen at random, or by other factors to represent you, a choice you werent allowed to make. The winner takes all method only takes away from states like Texas and California who know their vote doesnt matter because these people will always agree on democratic or republican, and what is currently used in our society. This damages thousands of voices, thousands of votes that could have matter, but seemingly don't. Just like\u00a0 how schools have implemented the 'No Child Left Behind' policy, we should transcribe this to leaving no american citizen without a voice, only dependant on what state their in.  My friends father always complains about how the voting systems work here in the U.S. He believes that the electoral votes should not really matter. He strongly leans on the idea that candidates should win an election by the popular votes. Although the Electoral College has helped with many situations before, like the 2000 election, when Al Gore had the more popular votes then Bush yet, fewer electoral votes.  Throughout our nations history the majority vote has lost due to being outvoted when it comes to Electoral Colleges. Because of the majoity vote losing out to Electoral Colleges, people have come to believe their vote will not matter in the long run ",

                "content": "In conclusion, video conferencing and taking online classes with distance learning is not the best thing for students, because of the conflict and problems that come with it. It can greatly affect a student's education. With online classes, students may be faced with distractions which can cause them to stay off task and bring down their grades leading to frustration and depression. This can lead to suicidal thoughts and drain a student's life. Health is very important, and it is necessary that our bodies should be healthy. Taking online courses can have a negative and tragic effect on a student's body leading to eye problems, the eye being a very important body part. This may eventually let the student become unproductive and lazy. Also many students prefer having a face to face teaching session to make learning more efficient and better to understand overall. Students across the world should be able to learn the importance of physically being in school where there's plenty of teachers and resources around. Being in school is very important and can greatly benefit students. Technological advancements in the modern world is also very important and have been beneficial in helping with education and making education better. But students should not let the technology of today make them lazy and they should be willing to work hard and diligently.   \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0   \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0  In conclusion, online course do not benefit students because gaining an in-person experience with teachers can help a student learn better from their mistakes on certain types of questions. They also do not benefit students by having more of a likely chance to cheat during exams online. Because of this, this does not prepare students for further growth of knowledge if they want to continue to do school after high school. The final reason students do not benefit from online courses is that students need friends in person because that is what makes them have a good childhood and become a better person based of off their opinions. To conclude, online courses are not a way to help students at all during this day and age. It has too many flaws that can not be fixed unfortunately. A lot of things are growing in this society, but this should not grow any further.  Putting one-hundred percent of their efforts into academic-related activities, such as studying for exams, doing their homework, etcetera, will help students in the long run.  They will get better grades, go to better colleges, get better jobs, and ultimately live better lives. This policy encourages this needed hard work in school, thus, is a commendable one.  A fundamental tenet of college and pursuits beyond it is a philosophy that partial self-education inherently breeds- learning is not about being fed a prescribed diet of knowledge, but rather seeing depth in all the ornate structures that make up the world. Schools employ countless lackluster brands of methodology to try to better ready students for college, such as the SATs, AP classes, and general preparedness lectures, but what can really prepare one better than diving into the closest thing to the actual situation themselves? By introducing students to this kind of learning, online schooling, on the students' end, helps to both de-stress students about college and get them invested in their own education. Many claim to know complex answers concerning the root of today's educational crisis, but there really is one easy fix- make students care about what they're doing and feel comfortable with it, and more students will find success and contentment in adult life. Ironically, the education system's primary function (to ready students for college learning) can really only be accomplished well with online schooling, a method many systems have yet to apply.   Some students may have different circumstances in which they are not able to go to school everyday, but distance learning could help them get the education they need despite these circumstances  If student-designed projects are too easy, they end up simply becoming busy work. More difficult teacher-designed projects would challenge students, which may seem unappealing to many, however in order to grow academically, students need a stimulus to respond to. Moreover, students become stronger learners when they are forced to overcome challenges. These challenges could include: reading a book in a foreign language; reading a book that is longer than they would like and far more dense than they are used to; or having to perform operations with dificult mathematic equations, formulas, and concepts. Nevertheless these challenges will make students think heavily and help them become better educated.  Overall, while online schooling would allow more comfort for the students, it would greatly inhibit their academic affairs, for they would not have access to crucial aspects of educational development, including social interaction, interactive experiences, and individualized relationships with educators. Without these fundamental components, students would not acquire lasting, solid educations, limiting their career possibilities and therefore the quality of their lives.  To optimize the educational as well as general quality of future generations, physical schooling must be promoted rather than the attendance of school from home.\u00a0\u00a0  This may help students feel less overwhellmed however it will not prepare them for the rest of their schooling years because as previously stated the course work only gets harder and simplifying the work load will not do anything.  . It may be because they are not very good test takers or their study habits are very poor. Some might not be able to concentrate and they get distracted very easily. It would be unfair for these students because of their inability to maintain the B average. The school would be responsible for not letting these kids participate in sports and other activities; therefore, in order to give them a better chance at getting the B average, the school should provide tutoring and extra help sessions for the kids who really need the help. The teachers could give them verbal quizzes on what they are learning if they are not very good test takers. They could give them homework that they might better understand and also provide them with extra credit opportunites. The sports teams may despretley need a kid that is very athletic, but not very smart and if this policy were to go into effect, then the school must provide the additional help.  It should not be an expectation for students who simply wish to pursue their interests to enter an extremely competitive and difficult environment for the same education that they could receive through less traumatic means. Although institutions like Generic_School of Science and Technology boost a student's resume, they are wholly unnecessary for students who just want to take a couple extra classes and maybe receive some extra credits.

                "content": "With these two reasons we can determine the value that they would have in schools. grades would get better, some may inspire to work harder because someone or something can tell they are confused and need help. Another quote that can support my claim is that \"Most human communication is nonverbal,including emotional communication,\" \"so computers need to under stand that, too.\" What this means is that the one kid who is afraid to speak up and ask questions or the kids who cant speak at all will get better help, because the computers can identify what emotions they are feeling and help them.  In this article, the author includes, \"'Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional connection,' notes Dr. Huang. 'So computers need to understand that, too,'\" shows just how the students may become more engaged and interested in their classes that take up so much of their week days. (D'Alto 6). If the computers would be able to connect with the students, there is no reason that these kids would not feel more obligatred to pay attention and more interested to learn what is being taught. (D'Alto 6). Another reason that these kids would gain more by having this system in their schools is the idea that would engage them in a fun manner. When the author included, \"The Mona Lisa demonstration is really intended to bring a smile to your face, while it shows just how much this computer can really do,\" the reason is stated so in the text. (D'Alto 6). By including this piece, the author is showing that there, overall, is a fun factor to this could intrigue the students and keep them interested in their assignments and school overall. With these two ideas in mind, it can be seen that, as the attention of students is a primary need for schools, if this could improve just that, there is no reason not to include it in student's lives.  Often, when teachers ask if everyone understands the material, students who do not understand, will be too emabrassed to ask for help, or the teachers, with such a large class, will not notice if one or only a few students are falling behind. Furthermore, in the article, Dr. Huang states that \"'most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication\" meaning that most communication is picked up in other ways, such as visually. Unfortunately, often in a classroom setting, teachers must face away from their students when writing on a white board at the front of the classroom, or in similar situations, which means that without the visual connection, much of the communication between students and teachers is lost. The new technolgoy could help with this problem, as it could identify students' emotions even when a teacher's back is turned, and thus could alert teachers and help them improve their lessons to fit their students' needs. It could also help evaluate emotions that teachers do not notice, such as if a student is confused, they may try to hide it. This new technology could identify these emotions and help the teacher make sure all of their students understand the material, which would lead to an improved quality of teaching and learning.  Electronics as of now are programmed to teach a student however are unable to sense how the student is feeling or how they are actually doing on their assignment. As the author states in the article, \"most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication\" something which computers are unable to detect (para. 6). Not only this, but the author gives an analogy that states \"if you smile when a web ad appears on your screen, a smilar ad might follow\" and explains that in a classroom, similar techniques can be applied to benefit the student (para. 6). Using this program will allow technology to advance and in turn will benefit the student.  In the passage \" Making Mona Lisa Smile\" the author states in paragraph 6 line 6,\"A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,\"Dr Huang predicts.\"then it could modify the lesson like an effective human instructor.\",this kind of technology can possibly boost testing score and even help children falling behind instead of holding them back another year. The text also states in paragraph 6 line 10 that ;\"Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communcation,\"notes Dr. Huang.\". This example actually explains alot of real world issues in the classroom, such as the fact that some students refuse to even try to communicate their confusion or boredom in the classroom so then they often disengage in the lesson and miss every part that would be essential to reaching standards created by the state.  like its says in paragraph 6 \"Imagine a computer that knows when you're happy or sad\". For example if you smile when a web ad appears on your screen a similar ad might follow. But if you frown the next ad will be different \"A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored \"Most human communication is nonverbal including emotional communication\" noted Dr. Huang \"So computers need to understand that too  The skill to be compable of working through tough situations is essential to posess. Modifying a students' workload would harm their motivation. These students will no longer be motivation to be their most effective because they will expect everything in life to be modified to their liking. Unfortunately, this is not a trait that can be successfully transferred to real world issues. Therefore, these students will be less prepared for potential problems they may encounter. This system would also decrease the dependence on human connection. The text states that computers need to understand emotional communications because \"most human connection is nonverbal\" (D'Alto 6).  As stated in by Nick D'Alto, most human communication is not verbal. Meaning that people express their emotions by their looks or their actions, but they chose when to do this. The Facial Action Coding System takes away this freedom from students, they do not have the choice when to express what they are feeling if anyone can just use a face scanning system on them. \" Imagine being able to detect exaclty how other people are feeling, even when they are trying to hide their emotions (D'Alto 1),\" this first sentence perfectly shows how it takes away peoples freedom of when they want to express certian emotions tocertian people.  Another reason why it is invaulable is that a human is already prepared to read another persons emotions because it is a task that is already done each and everyday.  Verbal human communication is relied upon to determine what about a lesson plan confuses a student, and although a computer might register a student's confused expression and recognize that the lesson pace might be too fast for this individual scholar, the computer would be unable to pinpoint what exactly the student fails to understand. Other events may be weighing down heavily on a student's mind, causing their face to contort and convey the emotions brought on from factors outside of the learning setting. A change in emotion not caused by a difficult lesson plan would cause the software to possibly alter the lesson pace when the student did not require any adjustment and ultimately generate frustration in the already distressed student.

The camera on board MGS had to peer through wispy clouds to see the face and perhaps alien markings were hidden by haze. Also NASA can be hidding information about the Face. But, you can see that the Face is formed by shadows, and not an alien haze.  So, while some conspiracy theorists would like to think that aliens created this well-known face on Mars, they are incorrect. The face on Mars is just a natural landform that was wrongly perceived by the public. By advancing in digital technology, understanding the effect of shadows, and realizing that there is no evidence to support aliens on Mars, it can be concluded that the face on Mars is just another peculiar natural landform.  In conclusion, some people may think there is alien life on Mars because of past picture or conspiracy theories. No one can denty however, that NASA has proven the Face to be nothing but a natural landform on the Red Planet Mars. NASA has proven this by recent pictures, scientific evidence, and real-life examples and measurements. Over the years, NASA has worked hard to figure out the mystery of the face, and just recently they have discovered, with pictyures, evidence, and measruements, that the Face is just a natural landform with unusual shadowing formed on the Red Planet Mars.  The first picture that was taken of the face on Mars was taken in 1976 and the quality back then was not as good as it is now. The picture that was taken in 2001 was a higher quality picture and scientists figured out that is was just a mesa and not a sign of any ancient civilization on Mars. For example the camera used in 1976, spanned 43 meters compared to the camera NASA used in 2001 spanned 1.56 meters. In the picture of 1976, the shadows that were present that day formed an illusion that made it seem like there was a face. In paragraph two of the article \"Unmasking the Face on Mars\" it says that, \"Scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia, only this one had unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh.\"  I find it highly unrealistic that NASA would even have been able to determine what the Face was forty years ago, much less hiding a discovery of extra-terrestrial life that could make a huge profit for the space program. And, had NASA really claimed that the Face was an object built by otherworldly life, surely someone would let the cat out of the bag. Not to mention that, if the vast majority of NASA believed it was an alien monument, do you really think that they would wait eighteen years to investigate the subject again? On top of all of this, it's simply illogical that aliens would create such a thing. As far as we all know, the supposed \"aliens\" on Mars have never come in contact with a human, much less seen one. That only leaves possible explanation; aliens created a monument that of which coincedentally resembles a human head. An absolute coincedence.  It does look like it could be from another living organism, but it's just a rock on the planet. In our newest image of the rock, it turns out that the face has dissapered. There is no evidence of this being created by aliens, rather it was created by wind and water that has been found on Mars. The reason you might believe that this was indeed aliens, might be the fact that the news has blown it out of poportion. It's just the rock that had some interesting shadows and holes that made it look like a human face.  In 1976 NASA released a photo of a landform on Mars resembling a human face. Not everyone was easily convinced that it was only just a landmass though. Conspiracy theorists believed that it was, \"Bona fide evidence of life on Mars.\" In the article \"Unmasking the Face on Mars,\" the author, Garvin, believed that it was only a mesa.  I'm a scientist at NASA and the Face, a lot of people seem to think was formed by aliens or is proof of alien life forms, is actually just a natural landform  Mars has been a planet that we have been exploring for many years. We have discovered many abnormal objects on the planet. In 1976, we took a picture of the region Cydonia, and we found something that seemed to look like a human face. Our eyes are adapted to recognizing faces and that is why we recognized the face on Mars more easily. Higher quality images that were taken in 2001 show that the face on Mars is no sign of ancient civilization on Mars but in fact a mesa.  Even thoug hmy colleague still believes in the \"Face on Mars\" to be a alien made structure. I still believe it's only a butte or mesa. With my evindence of the \"Face on Mars\" only looking like a face due to the techonology of the time, the shadows of the sun, the angle the picture was taken, and our ability to see faces when none are there, I believe I have conclusive evidence that the \"Face on Mars is nothing but a butte or mesa.

But, you can see that the Face is formed by shadows, and not an alien haze.  Life contains many differences, includes positive and negative things, truthful or untruthful. Some people said emotions are never lie. We could figure out the statue of someone by looking at their face, and that's true. However, life is something really complicated, sometimes things in front of you don't mean like what you think. Likewise, even though the expression from people face is the most authenic, when they are trying to hide their feelings, we literally cannot know their real emotions. The changing of teenager is issue that causes headache for parents, their characters aren't the same like before, their emotions are changed. Both of them could not find the common speech, and push them further each other. That is the moment, the childrens easily fall in the darkness. For real instance, children or students aren't agree about their parent's thinking, or the education from school completely. Most of them don't say it out, or talk back. It's really affects about effective in studying and their plans in the future.  My footsteps seemed impossibly loud as I walked into the classroom, and it felt as if everyone was watching me. I glanced around, taking in the unfamiliar eyes staring me down.  I'm never going to fit in here.  One of the eyes turned away from me and began to speak. She formed strange sounds with her mouth in a language that wasn't familiar to me. I turned around and ran out of the room, feeling so alone, so deserted. Salty tears stained my cheeks.  A week ago, I had taken a 14 hour long flight from  Generic_City to Generic_City. It was my first time being somewhere else other than my home country, and I felt so intimidated by the new environment. Strange shapes, strange sounds, and strange people with impossibly bright hair and piercing eyes surrounded me. It was all beautiful to me - but at the same time, the most horrifying thing I'd ever seen. I felt trapped in a haze. This haze was brimming with thoughts of never fitting in, never adapting to these alien surroundings, and mostly - the crushing feeling of homesickness.  This haze pushed me down into a deep cavern, and I was encapsulated by darkness. Even though my parents tried to find me in this cavern, every search effort was in vain, until something miraculous happened. An angel, perhaps, entered the deep labyrinth and ushered me out. Her name was Ms. Generic_Name. She gave me a new perspective, a new bias. Ms. Generic_Name told me to view this unfamiliar atmosphere as something special, a new opportunity - not a hostile monster trying to swallow me whole. She told me to be glad of the change in my life. This was the first time I had ever listened to somebody's opinion and savored it in my heart. I didn't know the importance of listening to the viewpoints of others at the time. I thought  I always knew what was best; after all, nobody knew me better than myself. I took her words and used them as fuel for learning English and making friends. I thought her words were all I needed, but somehow, I was still in despair. I still struggled. So - I decided to let someone else tell me what they thought was best.  After school, I talked with my parents. I told them what I felt, that I was always alone. That I felt so, so homesick. They told me it was good to feel that way. Moving overseas was a tough thing to endure, and they said it was healthy to let myself feel down sometimes. They told me I didn't always need to pretend I was happy when I was not. These two opinions from Ms. Generic_Name and my parents shaped me as a person - I learned to let people in, and know that seeking multiple opinions is a wise thing to do.\u00a0Because of this, I learned to speak English and surround myself with a group of compassionate, kind friends who guided me through my darkest times. I learned to let in my parents and take notice that they always wanted what was best for me. I learned that I didn't always know what was best, and that was okay.  In 1988 a Viking 1 took a, slightly disturbing, picture. Of a face! Viking 1 found a landform that happends to look like an Egyptian Pharoah. This face was found and started major controversy.  Some people had thought that it was fake and others thought that it was just a coincidence. The massive sand storms just created a face. That's all that they thought. But can that be true?   Aliens never made the Face of Mars and the Face of Mars isn't real at all! It's just a natural landform by having the shadows covering up most of the landform making it appear as a face. For the conclusion, Cydonia has a natural landform on it that appears itself as a face using the shadows to make the illusion.  Do you believe in aliens? An abundance of people in America think there are others among us from other planets and galaxies. They believe this for a variety of reasons, such as UFO sightings or because of the so-called \"Face\" in Cydonia on the Red Planet Mars. Throughout the years since 1976 we have worked at NASA to discover the secrets of the face, uncovering that it is indeed just a landform with suspicious shadows.  In conclusion, some people may think there is alien life on Mars because of past picture or conspiracy theories. No one can denty however, that NASA has proven the Face to be nothing but a natural landform on the Red Planet Mars. NASA has proven this by recent pictures, scientific evidence, and real-life examples and measurements.

The acknowlegement of this accomplishment is astounding to all that try to understand it. This is the new normal, and it is sure to go on for years to come. Everyone will want to see a car that no one has to drive. This is how far technology and understanding has gotten people. Never in anyone's wildest dreams did they think of a car without a human behind the wheel. Now, people do not have to try to believe it.

Over the years, NASA has worked hard to figure out the mystery of the face, and just recently they have discovered, with pictyures, evidence, and measruements, that the Face is just a natural landform with unusual shadowing formed on the Red Planet Mars.  With all of the technology used to investigate the red planet, proof of alien life should have already been found. Jim Garvin, chief scientist for NASA's Mars Exploration Program explained, \"As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size...So, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!\" By stating this, Garvin is saying that if there was any evidence of aliens builing this face on Mars, it would have been found.  n paragraph 10 it says,\" ...43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo.\" This shows that the photo didn't give very compelling evidence that there was life on Mars. soon later NASA and their supporters claimed that this face is just an act of nature is because of the 1998 Global Surveyor spacecraft. This new spaceship passed over the red planet to take pictures of the \"face on Mars\". The pictures were ten times better than the last pictures of Cydonia this time. The new photos clearly showed a landform on Mars and not a man.  In 1976 the face looked like a face. In 1998 it started to not look like a face at all. In 2001 it just looked like a rock. So i believe that it was not created by aliens but that it was just something the olanet had made itself. This has certainly got the attention of the people.  The \"Face on Mars\" is not a face. If you look at the pictures from 1976, and 1998, and 2001 and in the text it says that the photo from 2001 is the most recent photo that NASA has. It still looks nothing like a face so since the 2001 picture is the most recent it shows that it is just a natural landform. It is just a natural landform. On Mars there are natural landforms everywhere and the fade away. Here on earth natural landforms are created everyday.  The two oppsing sides in this argument have evidence to argue their opinion. The belief that the mesa is actually a face is inncorect due to evidence in the article and my essay. Mesa's are common in the area the picture was taken and the face was caused by shadows along with a low quality camera. Whichever side you are on I believe I have brought forth enough evidence to change your opinion or strengthen your opionion that there was no alien lifeforms yet found on Mars.  About twenty-five years ago, something happened around Mars. NASA, snapped photos of the object. On Mars, there is a face printed on the plant. People think it was created by aliens. NASA said it was created on it's own. Scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa. Those are common around Cydonia. A couple of days later NASA saw a nose, eyes, and a mouth.  Are you ready to accept the truth about the Face on Mars? I have listed valid, credible arguments including the high resolution of the 2001 photo, and the weak resolution of the 1976 photo. I also questioned the logic of extra-terrestrial life, and the logic that NASA would have used to cope with the discovery of aliens.  In 1976 NASA released a photo of a landform on Mars resembling a human face. Not everyone was easily convinced that it was only just a landmass though. Conspiracy theorists believed that it was, \"Bona fide evidence of life on Mars.\" In the article \"Unmasking the Face on Mars,\" the author, Garvin, believed that it was only a mesa.  In the end, the landform was found to be a Martian mesa. There are many mesa's in the region of Cydonia and that's a part of how we found out how it was a natural landform. Also the Surveyour verified that there wasn't any other monuments near the landform. If there was any life on Mars we would want to tell the people so they can be intrested in the activity at NASA, but for now there has not been found any life activiy on Mars.    I find it highly unrealistic that NASA would even have been able to determine what the Face was forty years ago, much less hiding a discovery of extra-terrestrial life that could make a huge profit for the space program. And, had NASA really claimed that the Face was an object built by otherworldly life, surely someone would let the cat out of the bag.

Students, or anyone, only grow and develop when they're exposed to challenges and obstacles it builds their mental capacity and their problem solving skills. If a teacher choices to do a particularly hard project or assignment this pushes the students out of their comfort zone allowing them to make these new connections in their brain and gain new knowledge and working skills. But if a kid is allowed to design their own project for the summer, most kids aren't going to do an extravagant or hard project, but instead take a more simplistic and easier way because the students want to enjoy their summer and not waste it on a school project. This would be a detriment to the students academics and the skills they could've acquired if they were to apply themselves.  For example, look at this study that the Social Interaction and Communication Association took at a local middle school. When Students were pushed, or put out of their comfort zone to more things with others, they talked around 30% more than they use to, and had 45% easier time making friends with others. This shows that pushing these kids to talk to others more, or easing them out of their comfort zone, can really help them find people they can depend on. Showing that doing something like this can really be good for them. There isn't just that, there is also more evidence that proves this point! Generic_Name, A Counselor at Generic_School, Had this to say about pushing kids to do activities to meet new people \"There is usually a reason kids can be like this, it's because they haven't found the group of people that understand them, when pushed though, they can find those people, and feel like they belong,\". This shows that, from what Generic_Name observed, the students can find their people if they have someone help them try something new, and that they just need that little push to find them.  The final reason our school should continue to require extracurricular activities is because it gives students the opportunity to try new things.  Students could enjoy their summer with this project because they are doing something they're passionate about. This will benefit students because they tend to put more effort into something they want to do. Also for students doing something they want to do, they strive to succeed and they'll choose something that they're comfortable with. In addition students could still enjoy their summer because of the stress it takes off of the student for them not having to go out of their comfort zone to complete another project subject that they have no clue about. The stress taken off students for the summer is beneficial because it gives them an energetic start to the next school year.  For example, to the student at home, his or her own grade is the highest, as it is the only point of comparison for him or her. However, at school, academic competition among peers allows for students to push themselves outside of their comfort zone, achieving their highest potentials. Additionally, the motivation of a student who takes classes from home is less than that of a student in a classroom as students at school are more exposed to the opportunities that other students have taken advantage of, such as sports and extracurriculars. This allows a student in school become motivated to simply engage in more activities and accomplish more in his or her fields of interest. The interaction that school promotes creates motivation among students and allows them to engage in healthy competition, while accomplishments more in their academic career.   This safe environment to pursue interests and hobbies would allow students to explore all kinds of activities and try to see which activities they would like to dedicate themselves too  By creating student driven projects, many students get the opportunity to show off what they can do without being confined into the same box as their peers. For them, it is a way to stand out among those students around them. When the student can create something that they are passionate about, they will want to complete it to the best of their ability. But, since they are learning this material on their own, they are more likely to have a strong foundation on the topic which is only something that is beneficial to them in the end. By schools implementing student-designed summer projects, their students will be better off in the end.\u00a0  By allowing students to choose a topic that is compelling to them, they will be driven to complete the project with their best effort  Having students participate in at least one extracurricular activity allows them to socialize with students, participate in activities they enjoy or even find something new to try.

                "content": "We get tired because of all the stress and thinking we had to do all day. After a normal school day is over, kids are really tired and are exited to go home. We go to sleep late at night, and wake up relatively early, making it hard for us to get up, which makes us more tired than the average person. Making clubs required means that school will be extended. It is not reasonable to force the students to stay an additional few minutes to do more work. Even if the we are not tired from a school day, we still have loads of work to do after school. The same goes for the teachers. They don't want to teach kids for any longer. If the teachers have a bad day than it's even worse because they want to be alone. After their final teaching session is over, they have to do more work like grading test, projects, or homework. When school is over, I'm extremely exited to go home. I'm am sure that everyone else feels the same. If I had to stay in school for any longer, I wouldn't feel good when I come home. When I get home from the extra activity that I'm doing, I'll feel so drained and I won't be able to practice tennis, or focus on studying for a test. My English teacher, Generic_Name, says she is very tired from teaching all day. She thinks that there is no point in making kids more tired because they probably can't do their work correctly at home. With the tired students and teachers, there is no point in required extracurricular activities.  Thousands of deaths could be prevented each year if everyone were to simply put their phone down while driving. No notification, song, or post is worth compromising the safety of the general public. Ensuring others' security should be a priority for all americans. When one fourth of car accidents involve cell phones, there is a serious problem. Complete focus and concentration on the road while driving should just be common sense. Keep the phone down.   A picture, song, video, etc. is not worth you getting yourself hurt or hurting someone else is not worth or even making some have a bad because you made them get stuck in traffic. Maybe you didn't even hurt yourself but you did hurt someone else just because you're ok doesn't mean you couldn't have hurt someone else bad. You need to get use to not having the urge to pull out your phone every time you get a notification. If you an emergency and you just have to use your phone pull over and park somewhere just don't pull it out and think you can multitask we you know you got to pay 100% attention to the road.          There are plenty of other distractions that go on when driving a motorized vehicle, but the use of phones is most caused. These deaths and accidents from distracted driving with your phones can be very managed. If people were to follow the law of not using them in the car and to be more careful then these outrages percentages will become more and more less. Also, I would like to express the fact that there are many options in vehicles that allow you to use your devices via Bluetooth and voice control. So, if there was an emergency you can answer and talk on the phone without even having to pick up your phone and looking away. This concludes my essay I strongly believe in not using your devices while driving and I hope to have expressed the effect is has.  There are situations there a person is the best option. Unless the car can think for it self. The drivrless car is too unpredicatable and can put peoples lives in danger. Accidents occur all the time, i don't believe a driverless car can avoid an ongoing accident. Then there are situations with police, or stolen cars. Would the car give away its owner if they were on the run from the police? How would traffic stops work, would the car be so perfect to not break the law? The car could be harboring fugitives or runways or even kidnapped victims. The car wouldnt be smart enought to know, its going to do what its told and drive.  You've probably seen someone text and drive. In the few seconds they take to glance away from the road and at their phones, a car crash could happen. It only takes one second for your car to swerve into the other lane. Phones should never be used while driving for many reasons, and the main reason being that it is extremely dangerous. Texting and driving makes you 23% more likely to get in an accident. It's so much smarter to wait until you've reached your destination to use your phone. If you can't wait, you can pull over on the side of the road. If not, you could greatly risk your life.  Take for example the many young students who have died while driving because they were texting. Looking around while driving, you can see people distracted by their cell phones. These people are not only teenagers but also adults. The shocking truth is that texting while driving increases the chances of crashing by over 23 times normal driving. People have a longer response time when they text. Then the passengers may not be looking at the road because they may be on their phones. On average, an accident happens within two to three seconds when the driver is texting. So if you do get into an accident you could do major damages to another person car or worse you could cause severe health damage to the other person that was in the other vehicle. Using a cell phone while driving caused an estimated 1.5 million car accidents in the U.S. in 2018 according to the National Safety Council. The U.S. Department of Transportation reported that cell phone use while driving kills 3-000 to 6,000 people every year including the other that got was in the accident because of the bad driver.  Texting while driving can limit your response to someone coming out of nowhere, whether if it's a child, an adult, or a group of teens. When having less time to respond to something in the road while texting and driving it may lead to many accidents and deaths. In addition, the usage of your phone while driving can cause a dangerous environment to the people around you on the road. Anyone can walk into the road at any time of the day and staying off your phone prevents anyone including yourself from getting hurt. In the same way, texting while driving causes many dangers risking not only young teens lives, but also adults lives in future accidents. Texting while driving \"causes own deaths and others, and need to pay attention to what's going on\". Meanwhile, while driving needs to be taken more serious you never know what to expect on the road.  think that if you didn't have the students at our school do community service you would be doing them a great injustice. When we are so privileged to have a nice home, clean water, and a meal on the table every night we should at least be able to go out for an our or two and help someone else who isn't as privileged. Its hardly a great burden to get up from the computer or desk you are at, put on a pair of old jeans and a t-shirt, and go out and help. So I ask only one thing of you; please set aside one day, one measly day, to have all of the students in our school wander out into the community and help someone.  When it comes to the law, texting and drinking while driving is illegal. If driverless cars were created and used, humans would be breaking two laws that harm drivers the most. Yes, the driver will be notified when they are in need by lights and a vibrating seat, but if they are under the influence they will not be able to anyways. If they are distracted in any way by texting, food, etc. then they will not be in a ready situation to take control of the vehicle. AS a driver, it would be nice to sleep and the driverless car would allow that, but that would be just as dangerous as sleeping behind the wheel in a regular car. The driver would not be ready to take the wheel or they would not even notice when they are in need to take the wheel. ",

                "content": "The writer claims that Venus is referred to as Earth's \"twin''. But the only evidence he gives to back up this claim is that \"Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of desnity and size.\"  Besides this, Venus is at times the closest planet to Earth as \"Earth, Venus and Mars, our other planetary neighbor, orbit the sun at different speeds. These differences in speed mean that sometimes we are closer to Mars and other times to Venus,\" (2). This could be extremely beneficial to both the inhabitants of earth and for future space travel because Venus will sometimes be our \"nearest option for a planetary visit, a crucial consideration given the long time frames of space travel,\" (4). All of these statements and claims that the author make support his/her claim that the exploration of Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it entails as they are quite literally explaining to their readers why exploration is as important as it is. This tactic has the ability to make audiences aware of the importance of such a mission, and hopefully persuade them to agree.  In the second paragraph, the author states \"...Often referred to as Earth's twin, Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size, and occasionally the closest in distance too.\"  Venus' relation to Earth is significant because it is the closest example of another planet like Earth.  While providing simple, yet interesting facts about Venus, such as it being the planet closest to Earth's density and size, may be enough to intrigue the audience into wanting to learn more about the planet, the author takes it a step further. The author goes in depth about the possibility of Venus being the most Earth-like planet in our solar system long ago. They detail the planet's environment today, consisting of Earth-like structures such as rocky sediment surfaces, valleys, mountans, craters, and other geological findings. They also state \"Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth.\" This information opens up an entirely new realm of possibilites for the audience to consider, and is more likely to interest them as it directly relates to our life on Earth. The way the author has set up the comparisons of Earth and Venus have allowed the audience to view the exploration of the planet as an opportunity to see a planet that could be like us; a planet with living, breathing forms of life similar to what we see everyday. The author uses this information to encourage the audience to view the pursuit of Venus as a chance to gain information on the things we see in our everyday life, and not just complex ideas that are difficult to understand and most-likely won't affect them.  He states that Venus is often referred to as Earth's \"twin\". This is because Venus and Earth are close in size, density, and at some points in orbit are the closest planets in the solar system. It is also believed that at one point, Venus was a lot like Earth is now. \"The Challenge of Exploring Venus\" states, \"Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our soloar system.\". The article goes on to say Venus most likely had large oceans that supported life, and the planet has things like craters, valleys, and mountains that we also have here on Earth. The author including these details helps get the point across that Venus is a lot like Earth, and with the little research been done already, we've found so much. This helps readers understand that the longer Venus is studied, the more we will learn about it.  Venus may have one of the harshest climates in our solar system, with an average temperature of 800 degrees Farenheit, and an atmospheric pressure 90 times greater than Earth's. Despite these major differences, it is also believed to be the closest to Earth by means of geological similarity. As stated in the article, scientists believe that Venus was most likely covered with oceans and quite possibly could have even hosted life. This idea is gathered from the similarities in structures between Earth and that volcano of a planet, like valleys, mountains, and an atmosphere.  Venus is considered the planet that is most similar to Earth. The passage explained that scientist speculate if there was once life on Venus considering it incredible geographical and size similarities to earth.  Venus, otherwise known as the \"Evening Star,\" is one of the more challenging planets to examine closely in our solar system. While this plant is often called Earth's twin, it is vastly different in terms of environment and hospitability. Despite being the closest planet to Earth at times, no spaceship has touched down on Venus in over thirty years. The dangers presented by Venus are many, but the author greatly supports the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite these dangers.  In summary, we should continue studying the planet Venus despite the dangers because if anything were to happen to our planet, Earth, Venus would be the closest planet we could go to, we could learn more about Venus and the planet's harsh conditions, and because Venus is most like Earth and had the ability to support life. Furthering our research on Venus can only benefit us, so lets stop worrying about the dangers and get out and explore our planetary neighbor. ",

For example if you smile when a web ad appears on your screen a similar ad might follow. But if you frown the next ad will be different \"A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored \"Most human communication is nonverbal including emotional communication\" noted Dr. Huang \"So computers need to understand that too  Nick D' Alto says \"Imagine a computer that knows when you're happy or sad.\" The author of this article talks of how it will improve ad placements by whether you smile or frown, however I know for a fact social medias, especially Facebook, are already basing information on preferable ads by just what material you look at. Why is it necessary for a program to constantly scan our face just to see if we like something or not? This gives the computer so much power of constantly knowing what your exact emotions are on everything. It is just so unnecessary that it causes one to question why in the world would we risk giving computers that kind of power. Also, is it appropiate to constantly scan childrens' faces as they are trying to learn? Would there be a security system in place or parental agreement necessary that would allow the permission of constant invasion of privacy in the name of education? There are many ethical questions and unknown future outlooks that one would not want to subject children to that sort of test of safety and security.  Their job is to connect and work with students. When introducing a computer system, students may realize they are just another task to be completed in the work place. Every year, students are analyzed to see where they place on the national benchmark for their education, they take standardized tests to see how much they know, they do hearing tests and eye tests, but a computer has yet to analyze them to see how happy they might be. If computers are introduced to read emotions, students may feel like they are just a number or rank of emotions. If students go to their counselors, they want to be talked to and connected with. Bringing in a computer can divide the connection from child to adult. The child may feel alienated and refuse to converse with the adult. This computer may seem like a helpful tool, but it destroys the importance of human connection.  Every living thing on planet earth has emotions. These emotions have been used since the beginning of time to express the feelings of the people around you. However, these emotions can be decieving. Someone could say they are happy, when really they are angry or upset. This is where the Facial Action Coding System comes into play. The FACS is a software that detects human emotion by tracking muscles in the face. For example, when you are happy, muscles in your face move up, and when you are sad, they move down, FACS tracks this and calculates your emotions. The creators of this software, Prof. Thomas Huang and Prof. Nicu Sebe are the leading experts of developing better ways for humans and computers to communicate. There are still some questions surrounding the usefulness of FACS, like what could this software actually be used for? One of the ways FACS may be used is in classrooms.  The ingenuity of the computers provide the resources and ability to decode complex human emotions and, in turn, will be able to be utilized in methods that will add to the betterment of society.  Imagine being a teacher and being able to read the students' faces an emotions. In paragraph 6, it states that \"the software can recognize when a student is becoming bored or confused.\" This can allow teachers to analyze the situation in which the classroom is in. If the students are generally happy, then you can go along teaching and educating them the same way as you did before. Now, what if the students were not so enthused about your lectures? If the students show a monotone facial expression, or maybe a bored and sad one, then it might be due time to go and fix your mistakes, make the plan more exciting, and get them excited about learning. This can improve their confidence and allow them to have a bright future.  As far as what is explained in this article the only benefit to this technology is that computers will know what you are feeling, and the question that needs to be asked is; do we really want them to?  For example,\" a classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,\" Dr. huang predicts. \" Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instrucuture.\" This is really helpful to some students because when taking an online lesson some of them might be comfused and the teacher is no there to help. So the computer can take these facial expresions and modify the lesson so you could undestand it better. This also follows along if a student needs help with the lesson, the computer could see you are having a hard time and t to help you by changing the lesson  Dr. Huang is talking about how it can change the ads you see and veiw if you dont look happy when you look at them. Dr. Huang states \"For example when a web ad appears on your screen and you smile a similar ad may follow, But if you frown the next ad will be different. A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,\" Dr. Huang predicts. This Quote and prediction of Dr. Huang states that is has potential to keep students intrestred into work  The age of computers is inescapable, but it doesn't have to be. Instead of computer analyzed emotional connection, people should put their phones down and ask each other how they are. Not every person wants their emotions analyzed, especially in schools. Students bonds with teachers are simply student to teacher; a child must trust an adult before they talk about their feelings. Computer facial technology might be helpful, but not in schools. This technology falls flat in the category of connection. Don't take the easy way out, instead of analyzing emotions with a computer, ask someone how they are. If a student looks upset, sit down and talk with them. Show someone they are valuable and deserve one on one human interaction ",

                "content": "As stated in the text, the conditons on the planet are \"far more extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth.\" Even with advanced technology that we have today, the article states that \"no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours.\" If the technology we have today can't even survive the conditions on Venus, how are humans supposed to be able to? Even though the author claims the conditions are \"not easy, but survivable for humans,\" the temperature can climb up to over 800 degrees Fahrenheit. These pieces of evidence from the excerpt convey the idea that Venus and its characteristics are far too dangerous for humans to even go near.  This, in turn, aids in convincing readers that might have originally disgareed with the author due to the fact that Venus' \"conditions are fare more extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth; such an environment would crush even a submarine assustomed to diving to the deepest parts of our oceans and would liquefy many metals,\" (3). The author, after making this counterclaim, refutes it by talking of some solutions to this ever-looming issue: \"NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions of the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray. Imagine a blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the roiling Venusian landscape,\" (5). The author talks of how the air pressure, temperature and radiation would all be survivable for humans. Some, such as the air pressure 30 miles above Venus, would be almost identical to Earth at sea level.  In this article the evidence they use for example: \"These conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth; such an environment would crush even a submarine accustomed to diving to the deepest parts of our oceans and would liquefy many metals\" and also \"A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus\" supports the controdicting claim that going to Venus is too dangerous with too many complications.  The author is for the exploration of Venus, but consistently chooses to bring up the problems that doing so faces. The author writes about the difficulties about exploring Venus, because of the planet's extreme environment. They opposed their own side in paragraph three by saying, \"These conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth; such an environment would crush even a submarine accustomed to diving to the deepest parts of our oceans and would liquefy many metals.\" This is an affective strategy, because people who may oppose exploration to Venus may say something similar to this. The author is arguing their own point to establish reliability and trust amongst with people who favor not exploring Venus. The author showing that they see the problems with exploring Venus shows that they are open minded and open to their mind being changed, and this will in turn have the reader do the same.  This temperature is beyond the maximun limit that human can edure, which leaves behind the compelling factor of wanting to study more of this sister planet. The author also states, \". . . and the atmospheric pressure is 9 times greater than what we experience on our own planet. These conditions are far more extreme that anything humans encounter on Earth.\" If the conditions of Venus are so bad, why should we be expected to study more of this planet. Similar to the carbon dioxide in the air, there is no way to change the temperature and pressure of an entire planet. Once again, the argument given by this author is not convincing.  The second issue, according to the people who want to stay grounded on Earth, is important for both sides to recognize. The people in the second perspective say it is not safe to go to Venus. We have tried it unmanned, and the unmanned spaceship counldn't live there for longer than a few hours, so it is too dangerous. \"On the planet\u0092s surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet. These conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth...\" (Paragraph 3). This quote helps support the second perspective for wanting NASA to kept its space ships from going to Venus. As the quote says, Venus is a very dangerous planet.  Venus has a temperature that humans can not survive in, 800 degrees Fahrenheit. Also on Venus the pressure is 90 times what humans experience on Earth. Humans have never experienced conditions as extreme as those on Venus: \"Even a submarine accustomed to diving to the deepest parts of [the] oceans\" would be crushed and the high temperatures \"would liquefy many metals.\" Something that was made to be able to go withstand high pressures, like a submarine, would be crushed on Venus, and metals can withstand very high temperatures but on venus they would liqeufy. It is unsafe and humanly impossible for humans to try to explore the land of Venus when some of the best technology can not even withstand the climate of Venus.  Although Venus is analogous to Earth, there are slight differences of the two planets. Earth has average low and high temperatures, while the temperatures of Venus are more extreme. Paragraph 5 reads, \"At thirty-plus miles above the surface, temperatures would still be toasty at around 170 degrees Fahrenheit, but the air pressure would be close to that of sea level on Earth. Solar power would be plentiful, and radiaton would not exceed Earth levels. Not easy conditions, but survivable for humans\" (The Challenge of Exploring Venus).  97 percent of carbon dioxide blankets venus and clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in venus atmosphere and a temperature of 800 degrees fahrenheit and atmospheric pressure that is 90 times greater than what we expirence on earth those conditions are way to extreme that humans don't encounter that on earth   In the early years of space industry, numerous spacecraft have embarked on missions to the planet, but they were not able to return home. Unlike Earth, Venus has an atmosphere that is \"almost 97percent carbon dioxide\" with a surface temperature averaging \"over 800 degrees Fahrenheit\" and an \"atmospheric pressure [that] is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet\"(Paragraph 3). Due to these extreme differences in temperature, pressure, and air content, Venus would be fairly inhospitable for humans. Usually when NASA launches missions to other planets they are trying to find alternatives habitats for the human race in the event that they cannot survive on Earth. If humans will not be able to withstand the conditions of Venus it is no longer a good option; therefore, it is not worth looking into since the author provides evidence that Venus would not be a useful living environment in the future.

The act of returning to Venus seems impossible due to the risks, although the insight that is wanted to be gained on the planet could lead to \"intimidating endeavors.\"  To illistrate, \"...human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors\" (8). The author explains how humans are naturally curious, and how this curiosity often times leads them to dangerous situations. Studying Venus has its dangers, but it is no different. Also stated, \"Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation\" (8). The author is promoting curiosity because it leads us to new things. Curiosity can overcome the fear of danger when exploring Venus to help us learn new things about the planet. To summarize, the power of curiosity in people is something the author uses to support their opinion of Venus being worth it to explore.  This temperature is beyond the maximun limit that human can edure, which leaves behind the compelling factor of wanting to study more of this sister planet. The author also states, \". . . and the atmospheric pressure is 9 times greater than what we experience on our own planet. These conditions are far more extreme that anything humans encounter on Earth.\" If the conditions of Venus are so bad, why should we be expected to study more of this planet. Similar to the carbon dioxide in the air, there is no way to change the temperature and pressure of an entire planet. Once again, the argument given by this author is not convincing.  The author supports their claim by giving numerous details and supporting his ideas.\"Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endbeavors.\" A big issue that is brought up are the harsh conditions Venus brings. \"On the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Farenheight, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet.\" Knowing this, you might think that they must stop there with their research because there's no way they can discover Venus now because it's to dangerous and harsh. That is false, \"NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray.\" Their solution is to have a vehicle hovering over Venus that would avoid the unfriendly ground conditions by staying up and out of their way. It would still be toasty but not deathly. The author claims, \" Not easy conditions, but survivable for humans.\" The author supports his claim by saying yes, the temperature is a challenge they will face, but NASA has one particular compelling idea for sending humans to study Venus, and they will continue to challenge themselves and find solutions to these conflicts they face.  For example, \"Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors\" (The Challenge 8). This evidence is only given in the last paragraph of the article and is not mentioned anywhere else. Also, the author lists many of the dangers of traveling to Venus, but does not dictate why it is worth the risk of exploring the planet.  Throughout the article, it suggests that studying Venus is still a worthy mission for astronomers, however, the dangers that come along with these missions are extremely dangerous and life-threatening. The author mentions the curiosity that scientists have involving Earth's sister planet, and the desire to still visit Venus regardless of the harsh conditions. With the article's use of both previous experiences of missions and spacecrafts, as well as shocking factual statistics of Venus, the claim is very strongly supported with evidence.   Venus used to be covered in oceans and supported life. Additionally, Venus still has features that are similar to Earth's such as a rocky sediment with valleys, mountains, and craters. Insight into the Venusian landscape would further allow astronomers to determine how closely related Earth and Venus were. The author also states that humans should not be limited by their fear to go out and explore. In the final paragraph of the article, the author describes how human curiosity will lead humans into many intimidating expidentures. However, the author believes that travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited simply due to danger, and humans should travel as far as their innovation will take them.  In \"The Challenge of Exploring Venus,\" the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents is supported through Venus' vast similarities to Earth, Venus' proximity to Earth, and the innovation in machines by researchers that could make them work long enough to expand mankind's knowledge on Venus. The idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers is supported through Venus' vast similarites to Earth, which is why humans have such interest in this particular planet. The idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the presented dangers is conveyed through Venus' proximity. The idea that Venus is a worthy pursuit despite its hostile environment is supported through the innovation in machines that could make the close-up exploration of Venus possible. The author believes that sometimes humans cannot let curiosity, imagination, and innovation be trampled by the dangers and doubts. Humans cannot live in fear all the time. The human spirit always demands that humans continue striving towards knowing more.    In conclusion, the author supports the exploration of Venus, and is open to finding ways to explore this harsh planet. He believes that the knowledge we would gain from Venus would be very beneficial to the people. He believes that mankind has endured many other harsh endeavors such as the exploration of Venus, and the curosity of mankind will likely lead us to exploring the great hot planet of Venus. ",

However, if one wishes to use this strategy, they must also make sure that they are asking people who have experience and past knowledge in the decision to be made. A high-schooler who is deciding between two colleges and wishes to ask others on the college he should attend should not ask random strangers walking down the street. Instead, he should ask other gifted students, prestigious educators, or other intelligent adults who might know how to make a better decision than the student himself. However, even after receiving plentiful advice from others, one should know that you are still the person who should take all facts into consideration, and then make the final decision based on your thoughts and ideas.  Having a strong and well education is what is the most important when it comes to any person seeking the knowledge and insight to be able to pursue any career opportunities or other varying professions and lifestyles; furthermore, it is more widely known for students to attend a school and take courses from there  seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice because they can listen to others' point of view, get help from trained professionals, and can be given the opportunity to have a successful future. People should take initiative to ask for help and shouldn't rely on only one person's opinion.\u00a0  and you can make a better choice.  have better learning opportunities.   It seems unfair that the president of the United States, the most important man in the country, is not truely picked by the voters, but by the Elctoral College. The Office of the Federal Register says that the electors that are selected are chosen by the candidates political party but that stae laws differ on how they are specifically selected. This way does not seem like the best way of performing the task and I can see how it results in issues. Trusting the weight of the United Stated on the the backs iof only 538 electors is not the most stable way to perform an election. Why trust a select group with this descion if the whole United States can contribute to it  Putting one-hundred percent of their efforts into academic-related activities, such as studying for exams, doing their homework, etcetera, will help students in the long run.  They will get better grades, go to better colleges, get better jobs, and ultimately live better lives. This policy encourages this needed hard work in school, thus, is a commendable one.  Case and point, the Electoral College is a flawed system. People are educated and can make a smart choice for a president, everyone deserves fair say in the political world, and people need to open their eyes to the corruption that the Electoral College allows for. It may have made sense back in the day of the founding fathers, but it is time to move on and adopt the popular vote system that the people have asked for.     Many people think for themselves and only themselves. They are not qualified to make choices for the sake of the whole country, that is where the electors come in. These are people chosen by state conventions, state party committees, and sometimes candidates themselves. They hear the ideas of the people and manage them so that they are able to help everyone. They are pro politicians whose job in life is to preserve our country   determine what the best choice is by finding which answer is said most, ",

                "content": "In an election their really is a process of voting and voting again. Instead of couting the number of people who want a certain president and so on. We are viewed as a state and some states having more say than other even if the votes are in the same margin. This is the reason why some states are focused on more by the candidates and are heavily educated on the topic and given more attention than smaller states whose votes wont change much. an even bigger problem is te fact that most states operate on a winner-take-all basis so even a slight majority vote one way will give that person all of the votes. A very worrying prospect as expressed in source two is the possibility of a tie. in which the election would be given to the house of representatives. Each state only gets on vote so a representative representing 500,000 people would have as much say as representatives representing 35 million people.  In Source 2 Plumer declares, \"faithless electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party's canidate\". With this method of selection for our country's president, the vote is never certain. The slate of electors that the people essentially vote for may or may not stick to the original plan. This ties back into people losing hope that their vote will not matter because they trust the electors to vote their canidate into office, when the electors could go either way. Another key point is, the canidates may not campaign in states that have a lower number of electoral votes. In Source 1 the Office of the Federal Register also asserted, \"Most states have a 'winner-take-all' system that awards all electors to the winning presidential canidate\". Due to the Electoral College system being based off population some states have more of a say than others. Whenever a state decides their votes for Electoral Colleges the state typically contributes every vote it has to one canidate. When this occurs the state's people may be misrepresented.  The slate of electors is not picked by the people.\u00a0 It is said in, \"The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid jdefenses of the system are wrong\", that sometimes the state conventions, the party's central committee, or the presidential candidates themselves choose who will be their electors.\u00a0 That being said, you don't know whether or not the electors will follow your choice of president or not.\u00a0 For example, in 1960, some electors refused to vote for their party's candidate and they chose whomever they wanted. If we were to switch the way things are now, that would not happen.\u00a0 A poll taken in 2000 called the Gallup poll, showed that over 60% of voters prefered a direct election rather then the kind we have now.\u00a0 This took place when Al Gore recieved the popular vote, but lost the electoral votes.\u00a0 You can see that the current system has its flaws.   By this the number is much smaller since each country is weighed and is worth certain points and decided by electors you choosed to trust to vote for the same president you did. You still are in control just that you choose somebody he/her is not likely to change his or her mind and vote for the exact person you want he or she to vote for. It stated in the article that \"Each candidate running for president in your state has his or her own group of electors. The electors are generally chosen by the candiate's politcal party.\" I say that if the candidate political party chooses the electors then they must be good and the party must be sure the elector won't change his mind out of no where.  They have much more power than the standard voter. The electors would completly oppose the most \"popular\" vote and put in their vote for whoever they feel deserves it. This is wrong and totally goes against the idea of giving the people power. This would qualify as just giving a few people power. There could also be room for a tie. This could result in the elcetion ending in the hands of the House of Representatives where the state delegates could chose the president. Not only is this destorying the power of the general public but this could also result in people not getting what they wanted. The delegates cuold go completly against what the people say because they technially have the right to since they have the power of the situation.  With the electoral college the citizens are'nt the ones voting for the president the electors are. In the electoral college the voters are voting for a slate of electors, who then vote for the president. In most cases the elector votes for the candidate that their party wants, in some cases the elector has chosen the oppossing candidate to what his party wants according to the second source. Since the elector is allowed to do this that is one reason why the electoral college is unfair. Popular vote is when the people vote for the candidate they want this is truly what a democracy is when the people choose their representatives.  Under the Electoral College, voters do not vote directly for who they want as president, but instead for a slate of electors, who in turn select the president. Although these electors may pledge themselves to a particular candidate, there is no way to determine whether or not they end up casting their vote according to the will of the people who put them in charge. Such an unpredictable turn of events could be avoided if only the outcomes of presidential elections were determined by popular vote, not through an Electoral College.  In conclusion, the Electorial College needs to be replaced with a more fair, balanced system. It has the potential to allow the electors to defy the will of the people who voted them in, invalidating the people's votes and making them pointless. It also has candates only focusing their ads and visits on the states with more votes and the states biased towards their party. Finally, it has almost all the states have a landslide \"winner-takes_all\" style of awarding electorial votes. This means if one side of electors only wins by a slim margin, the other side gets nothing, even though since they lost by a small number they clearly have a sizeable amount of voters for them. The Electorial College needs to be removed before someone takes advantage of it's serious flaws and takes the votes of the people and makes them useless.     In conclusion, the Electoral College seems unconstitutional, since a variety of issues can occur due to the many problems that could potentially occur. The United States should shift into a more reasonable and logical means of electing our president in our Republic, where everybody is equal. The Electoral College should no longer decide the president based on the possibility of a tie, the possibility for betrayal of trust and disputes due to how close the votes are. The system should change to where the popular opinion should\u00a0 decide on the president of the United States of America, making people believe that their vote will be fairly counted.  Citizens' wishes will not always be equivalent to what the electors vote for. This occurs partly because of the winner-take-all system. In this system, the winner of the popular vote in an individual state wins all of the electoral votes a state has. According to the Office of the Federal Register, all but two states use this system. These two states are Nebraska and Maine. As a result of the winner-take-all system, it is possible that a presidential candidate loses the overall popular vote, but wins more electoral votes and thus wins the election. This occurance happened in the infamous 2000 election, when Al Gore won the popular vote but lost to George W. Bush by a mere five electoral votes. If the public indicated they wanted Al Gore as president, why should Bush have won due to this unfair system? It simply doesn't make sense. The winner-take-all system also results in political campaigns to focus their efforts in only certain regions. Some states very predictably vote either for the Republican candidate or for the Democratic candidate. Take Texas, for instance, which has traditionally always voted red. A Democratic candidate knows he should not focus his campaign in Texas, because he realizes his best efforts won't allow him to win the popular vote there and thus win the electoral votes. Because of the tendencies of certain states, many electoral votes are practically predetermined. The states which do not typically only vote in favor of one side are labelled \"swing states\". With the way the Electoral College works, the few states which are a toss-up carry the most weight. Presidential candidates will usually spend most of their time in these swing states, and very little time in others. For example, in the 2000 election, seventeen states were not visited by either candidate. Supporters of the Electoral College view the disproportional focus of campaigns as a positive. According to Richard A. Posner's article in favor of this corrupt system, \"The Electoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment of the Senate decreed in the Constituion...\" (21) ",

Something needs to change because when you just walk outside of your house there's a piece of trash and you can help by just picking that piece up. If you could get all the students doing community service then those students could inspire other students or even their brothers, sisters or even their own parents. If just one person could help pick up a little trash then imagine what ten or even fifty people could do this world would be better in no time if everybody could just pitch in a little of there time everyday by making the world a little better.  The environment helps us by giving us air to breathe i think it's time to give back to the earth. Yes, it might take too much time away but we are doing it for a good reason and it is to live in a healthier, better community. They could do all they want during the weekends but it is better to help now while we can than to later on when we can't do anything about it. Also people that have asthma would help clean up the community because they don't want to get another asthma attack because people are polluting the air. If some people don't want to do community service that's fine because sooner or later they will regret it. We want people that have some kind of sickness to go outside and enjoy themselves. Most people that are sick or have heart conditions have to stay inside their home because it's too dangerous for them to go outside because we don't help keep the community clean and they might get an infection. When we go to school we should clean up after ourselves. Since people don't do that i think that they should do community service. I know everybody could do something even though if it's little it can still help out the community.  because we don't want to live in a dirty community. We also don't want viruses. If we keep this community clean then maybe a lot of people won't be sick and live longer.  Community service can help students with that by helping others and not feeling so alone. Like this one girl i knew was so caught up with her studies all she did then was go into her room and lock herself up. Later , when i noticed she'd gone too far i told her to help me clean up the streets that were covered in litter. She did and then from then on she found time for her work, friends, and community service  Hmm community service ? well i think that it is important because if people litter eventually out earth is going to be a total mess and the WILL be garbage everywhere , it would be a great task to do after school or on free time and importantly if you would be helping a student our education progress will most likely go up like fire works at the park on fourth of July  As the human race we must stand together united. If not help the homeless help the community littering problem. If not help the problem help the younger children. If we help the younger kids they may go on in life understanding to help you neighbor.  In the future we don't want our community to be filled with trash and things laying everywhere . We want a nice place to live and grow old . We want a even better future for our children, but if no one helps out then it won't be nice . It will be dirty and unsafe . The more we clean up and help now the better our future will be . That's why I think community service should be required .  That way kids would feel like their making a change and getting rewarded that's a great feeling. Some kids think community service is dumb and gross because you have to pickup trash. But if kids get rewarded they will strive to help in their community and stop trash build up on the freeways and out in front of their own houses little thing will start to build up and make kids want to do big things like go to other countries in need of help and help out with them like in Haiti were there is still a lot of rubbish all around. Kids and adults can help out every where there is need of help from the state of Ohio to all across America and then the whole world!   I think you should require it, at least to the 8th graders, because we need to start taking more responsibility in everything we do, and we would be helping our city and the people and animals that live around us, and we would be helping the future people living in this city by keeping it clean for them.  The world needs our help, and would do greatly with the support. Community service is a great way to keep the world and people healthy and happy. I personally think that community services are a great way to get everyone together to do positive things that can make a great benefit towards everything and everyone. ",

The Electoral College is widely regarded as an anachronism, a non-democratic method of selecting a president that needs to be overruled by declaring the canidate who receives the most popular votes the winner. I personally think that is the best way to decide who gets in.  \"The Electoral College is widely regarded as an anachronism, a non-democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be [overruled] by declaring the candidate who receives the most popular votes the winner. The advocates of this position are correct in arguing that the Electoral College method is not democratic in a modern sense . . . it is the electors who elect the president, not the people.\"  The Electoral College is as it says on the 3rd source \"widely regarded as an anchronism, a non-democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be [overruled] by declaring the candidates who receives the most popular votes the winner.\"  Source 3 states, \"...each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee (and that truth is barely betrayed)... however it is entirely possible that the winner of the electoral vote will not win the national popular vote.\" For instance, if the people vote for candidates for the electoral college, and the majority of them are not what the majority of the people wanted, or they lied about being pledged to a candidate for president, then there is still a chance that the candidate that the people did want could be elected, by the national popular vote. Also, the people that are against the electoral college shouldn't be, because the electoral college is not definite. Just because the electoral colleg votes for a certain candidate, does not guarantee that the overall national vote will be that person.  Each party selects a slate of electors that are trusted to vote for the party's nominee. Sometimes the electoral vote will not win the national popular vote. Another reason The Electoral College is a positive way of voting is how certain the outcome is. There is never failure in the counting of the votes and there us rarely a tie between two people. My favorite reason is because \"everybody is president\". This means everybody can make their own decisions and have a great amount of freedom.   \"The founding fathers established it in the Constitution as a compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote.\" (the Office of the Federal Register). People must remember that this system is a compromise for the election and that any change could lead to problems among the government again. The public must also remember that \"each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee\".(Richard A. Posner). This system also can often prevent disputes. \"A dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is possible...but it's less likely than a dispute over the popular vote. The reason is that the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College invariably exceeds his share or the popular vote.\" (Richard A. Posner). Along with the fewer disputes, it also creates standards for the candidate. \" The Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal...This is a desirable result because a candidate with only regional appeal is unlikely to be a successful president.\" (Richard A. Posner). Another benefit to this system is that it causes voters to pay closer attention to the election. \"Voter in toss-up states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign.\" (Richard A. Posner). Along with the more aware voters, the Electoral College is also very beneficial to the big states. \"The Electoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states (by population) lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment of the Senate decreed in the Constitution.\" (Richard A. Posner). And lastly, the Electoral Collee helps avoid run-off elections. \"There is pressure for run-off elections when no candidate wins a majority of the votes cast; that pressure, which would greatly complicate the presidential election process, is reduced by the Electoral College, which invariably produces a clear winner.\" (Richard A. Posner). To sum it all up, there are many benefits to the Electoral College.  The slate of electors is not picked by the people.\u00a0 It is said in, \"The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid jdefenses of the system are wrong\", that sometimes the state conventions, the party's central committee, or the presidential candidates themselves choose who will be their electors.\u00a0 That being said, you don't know whether or not the electors will follow your choice of president or not.\u00a0 For example, in 1960, some electors refused to vote for their party's candidate and they chose whomever they wanted. If we were to switch the way things are now, that would not happen.\u00a0 A poll taken in 2000 called the Gallup poll, showed that over 60% of voters prefered a direct election rather then the kind we have now.\u00a0 This took place when Al Gore recieved the popular vote, but lost the electoral votes.\u00a0 You can see that the current system has its flaws.   In \"In defense of the Electoral College...,\" it states that \"But each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee...however it is entirely possible that the winner of the electoral vote will not win the national popular vote.\" This means that even though you vote for a person, it's probably a fifty-fifty chance your person will win  each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee, and that trust is rarely betrayed\" (Source 3, Paragraph 2). So when the party selects their electors they are most likely to select the candidate of the party they were selected by. There is also regional appeal,if a president only has diserably mojority of vores in a certain region of the country he is \"unlikely to be a succesful president\"( Source 3, Paragraph 5) . This is because if a president is only desired by a certain region and not the rest of the country, the wants of the rest of the country aren't met and he most likely will not tend to the needs of them, and ultimately doesn't have a chance of being selected as president. Finally, when no candidate for president has a clear majority of votes, the electoral college's votes gove a clear winner and a candidate is selected. ",

Everyone's situations aren't the same, and so each individual one should always be considered, not compared to others. Advancement of technology has helped many people all over the world, regarding education. The ability to receive an adequate one\u00a0is essential for one's success and benefits the many people who don't have access to it. This not only includes K-12, but post-secondary education as well, as online degrees and certifcations are continously being introduced.  Finally, either it be the fact that a lesson can be changed based off of if a student is bored or confused. Or that having this technology can show students a wider range of possible job choices, hobby choices, or just learning more about something out of pure intrest. Or lastly, because having this technology around us gives us a reason to talk about the science of emotion in depth. This technology could be extreamly useful, and impactful on students, if the software being used is good and has been shown to be correct. This could be a very good thing to have in schools that our students can use and to possibly even learn about.  Although technology has made many daily tasks easier, school is a place that shouldn't be taken lightly, and has endless advantages. One of the biggest advantages of taking classes at school is being able to receive help from peers and teachers whenever a student needs it. This may not seem like much, but having the opportunity to get face-to-face help whenever it's necessary can make a big difference on a student's academic success. Not to mention, there are minimal distractions in school that make learning easier than at home.  Everyone that is successful right now has asked at least one person for help, I can guarantee you that. So if you need help just ask! It's one of the best ways you can get help anyways. There are over 1,000 different information data bases that can help you find information on anything. One that I like is Wikipedia it may not be 100% reliable but that's only if you're ignorant while reading it. Wikipedia has over a million topics of information that you can browse. See this may not seem like your asking for help but it is one way you can. I only listed one good source of information but overall there is hundreds of sources for information and you can get help from any of them.  Today, technology is rapidly advancing virtually everywhere. The iPhone, electric cars, large appliances, and many more useful new technological inventions have improved and helped assist everyone with their everyday tasks in a quick and resourceful manner. The new technology of the modern world is in workplaces, homes, and best of all, schools. Technology in school has rapidly increased especially as every student at Generic_School now has their own laptop for their own educational use. Now every student can get their work done through a computer at school, but not every student or teacher prefers it. Therefore, today, some schools offer distance learning for students to attend classes from home by way of online testing and course learning on their own. Many students and especially parents are skeptical of these online distance courses because they think that the old fashioned way of staying in school and using paper and pencil is the optimal way of learning. On the other hand, many people think otherwise, so this has become a great debate in the system of education for many counties and individual schools.  What is truly important about getting up in the morning and going to a gigantic building filled with hundreds of people is that it is filled with family, friends, neighbors, and even strangers. Meeting all of these people and learning new things about them can really strengthen the school-wide community connections. Advancements with technology also help us by letting students connect with other people in their community, but technology also doesnt help us if we are letting students attend classes online through video conferences. Doing so would cause a major lack of enthusiasm and relationships within a community. Going home independently and working on classwork without getting the chance to learn about your teacher or other classmates through this safe environment at school, causes a total downfall on community awareness.  The potential of this technology is huge, as it could be used to improve every student's life, both inside and outside of school. If schools were to have the ability to help students with any material they don't understand the first time and asist them in coping with or eliminating stress, it would make the experience of going to school much more enjoyable. This would motivate students to do their best to be successful in school, which would drastically improve their life, as well as society in general. If all schools manage to overcome the technical and monetary difficulties of implementing FACS in teaching, it would benefit everybody in many ways.  This technology is valuable to both teachers and students equally. The teachers are able to improve their teaching techniques and the students understand more in school. This technology, however, is nowhere near done. This technology can be further improved in many aspects. I could keep improving and always creating a smarter version of the present day technology, that may one day, change the course of education forever. This could be implemented in the online schools to understand if a student comprehends the information the value of this is unspeakable and should be institued in classrooms globally.       Within the past decade, humans have watched in awe as technology has improved exponentially, and learned to take on tasks once thought only humans could accomplish. Technology has been taught to communicate, entertain, solve problems, along with many other functions, and now it may be able to teach as well.  In conclusion, kids need time to talk. Giving us that time during the day could not only help you but it could help us. We could talk to our parents and solve small problems. We could enjoy our free time a little bit more. Finally, we could talk to other friends and just have a good time in general. That is why i think the cell phone policy should change so we can use our cell phones during class and free times. ",

It shows good personality and is superb for getting into college. However, if community service was to be necessary, then it would not be as beneficial.  There are many things that community service could do for your community. It helps bring new ideas and ways of life, brings more respect, and brings more pride to your town. All these things help your community grow and socialize. They all affect you in many good ways to help everybody. These were just some ideas I was writing to you about making every student do at least some community service. I think it is a great idea and will encourage it all the time.  Yes, community service is beneficial to the community, but students need to focus on one thing, and one thing only. School.  Finally, citizens would not view community service as beneficial for the community as they do now.  If community service was mandatory, it would not be viewed as a nice thing, it would not be enjoyed by all, and would not be as beneficial to the community.   Community service can mean a lot of things like picking up litter, helping people, doing work, tutoring people your also suppose to do everything that would in any way help it.  It not only helps and brings happiness to others but in ways you'll find that doing community service can help you too.  First of all, community service makes the place you live a better place, by creating a better environment to work, learn and live, as well as make everyone happier. The community benefits a lot from kids or adults actively participating in community service.  By making community service mandatory, you will be helping the lives of many other people or the environment. Little things like picking up trash in the park, or walking a neighbors dog, would really help out the town and the people living in it. Small things can make a big difference. And if everyone has to do community service, our town will be making a big difference in our community.  Research shows, that the cleaner and more beautiful the town or city is, the happier the people are. Who is happy when they are living in a trash can? Community service helps clean up the town, by simple things like picking up trash, or larger projects like planting trees. Education also benefits from community service, because we can teach the younger generation skills they need to grow up. Also, a better looking school, would be a better place to learn, because the students will be happier and more motivated. ",

                "content": "Scientists and more specifically astronomers are extremley fascinated in Earth's sister planet, Venus, as it is similar to Earth in certain ways, and is a close enough distance for travel. Venus was believed to once be very similar to Earth in terms of its geology, so therefore scientists are interested in discovering how the features have changed. However, the author of \"The Challenge Exploring Venus,\" explains the great dangers that the planet offers for both humans and technology to explore the planet. The act of returning to Venus seems impossible due to the risks, although the insight that is wanted to be gained on the planet could lead to \"intimidating endeavors.\"  Venus has great potential for exploration, but with that great potential comes great risk. The author of the article talks about the problems with exploring Venus, but he also talks about how exploring Venus is something that is a possibilty for the future. Venus is very similar to Earth in the terrain that they both have, but the surface conditions of Venus are deadly to humans. There is the possibilty of hovering above Venus to be closer to the surface without having to experince the extreme conditions. With the advancements in technology and new innovations scientists are hoping that there is a way for them to get closer to the surface without endangering their lives.  Many scientist are looking for a way to get samples of rocks,gas,or anthing else that they can use to find out more about venus but they cannot do that  When discussing the potential plans to explore the planet, the author states \"Many researches are working on innovations that would allow our machines to last long enough to contribute meaningfully to our knowledge of Venus.\" This quote makes it clear to the audience that scientists are doing whatever it takes to develop multiple, efficient plans for space travel. The author also goes onto provide different examples to further convey how close scientists are to developing the safest plan possible. They specifically mention the use of simplified electronics made of silicon carbide and explain how they've already been tested in a chamber that simulate the conditions of Venus's surfaces, yet how they're still being improved upon. They also describe an old technology called mechanical computer, noting how this technology has already been used frequently in the 1940's and how it can be incorporated into space travel now. The author has given detailed descriptions of the efforts made and the options available to provide a safe embarkment for humans to support the ideas that Venus is a worthy pursit.  In Paragraph 6, the author suggests, \"Therefore, scientists seeking to conduct a thorough misson to understand Venus would need to get up close and person despite the risks. Or maybe we should think of them as challenges.\" I believe the author is correct in this statement  Although the author describes how Venus could be studied from the air, scientists still desire to learn about Venus from the planet's surface. One of their solutions to the problem of getting equipment to last on the surface of Venus is to expirement with new materials. \"Simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the choas of Venus's surface and have lasted of three weeks in such conditions\" (7). Research and experimentation taking place on Earth is giving scientists and astronauts more options for studying Venus. Although conditions on Venus are not hospitable to life, these new scientific advances are making it possible for data-gathering equipment to be sent to the surface of Venus and last long enough to gather data. Other scientists are moving away from traditional electronics and looking into purely mechanical systems. \"Systems that use mechanical parts can be made more resistant to pressure, heat, and other forces\" (7). The alternative that has presented itself to would-be explorers of Venus is older technology, like that found in the earliest computers. Scientists have realized that modern technology is too fragile and that more durable technologies are needed. By turning to other forms of technology, scientists are widening their options for ways to study Venus. The author mentions three different ways that scientists are making progress towards being able to study Venus - from the air, using new materials, and using old technologies. The author's postion that Venus should continue to be studied is supported by the scientific advancements that are serving to make studying Venus a reality.  People are facinated with the Man on the Moon and the idea of Martians, but most people do not think about life on Venus. Venus is the second planet from the sun and shares many geographical features with Earth. However, studying this planet is made difficult by the dense and toxic atmosphere, high temperatures, and violent weather. Despite this, some people think that Venus should still be explored, and the author of \"The Challenge of Exploring Venus\" is of this opinion.  Paragraph 3 of the article is all about the extreme environment that Venus presents. Venus has temperatures over 800 degress Fahrenheit, an atmospheric pressure 90 times greater than that on Earth, erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and other obstacles that prove challenging for scientists to overcome. Additionally, Venus has clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in the atmosphere which prove to be challenging to scientists. These dangers may seem impossible to overcome, but scientists have been developing new methods to further their knowledge of Venus.   When talking about something as dangerous as exploring another planet, it is easy to see that our Earth bound technology simply cannot do the job. in paragraph 5 of the article, the author describes an idea that was thought up by \"The National Aeronautics and Space Administartion\". This idea is to have humans 30 or so miles above Venus for exploration. The author claims how this would be beneficial in keeping humans safe from the Venusian landscape. However, The author does not support this idea well, as he goes on to say how not much exploration can be done from there, and the conditions would still be extremely dangerous but \"survivable\". Also in paragraph 7, the author explains how NASA is working on other approaches to study Venus. He explains how they are working on some simplified electronics, made of silicon carbide, that have been testedd in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface. This may sound like a good thing, but it is far from one. This is because the author finsihes by saying that the electronics lasted only three weeks. If a computer can't withstand Venus's conditions longer than three weeks, I am very doubtful that a human can. This proves my point that our technology is far too inadvanced for such a task like exploring another planet. Therefore supporting my claim that the author did a poor job in supporting this idea.  This furthers the point more that NASA is also trying to send humans to go visit and study our planet's \"twin\". The author then goes on, proceeding to help our visualization of NASA's plan, telling the reader that NASA would not directly put humans on Venus's surface, but rather have them float in a blimp-like vehicle above the startpoint of Venus's weather and \"avoid the unfriendly ground conditions by staying up ad out of their way.\" The author lastly pointed out how, even with the toasty weather, Venus' surface is still survivable for humans, even though it's not full of easy conditions.

If all cars or vehicles were to stop being used the air would clear easily and we can all live in clear air. \"The smog cleard enough Monday for the ruling French party to rescind the ban for odd-numbered plates on Tuesday\"(Duffer, \"Paris bans driving due to smog\"). If they made like a schedule for which days cars will be banned and what days aren't, then the air we breathe will be better than ever and everyone will still be able to use there cars how they feel like.  Cars also cause poulltion and smog to hang over cities causing the air to be full of harmful chemicals, endagering peoples health and also causing a rise in asthma for the populace that lives inside the city. In places like Beijing,China smog and poulltion from cars cause the air to be so foggy and dirty that you cannot even see the sky. \"Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city.\"(Source 2). When Paris was accosted by the same problem they solved it by a temporary ban on driving to clear the air. Without so many people driving cars we wouldn't have these many issues with smog and it's effect on the enviroment.  The usage of vehicles are a double-edged sword. They may get us to where we need to go with plenty of time to spare, but what are we really loosing because of it? What we are loosing is the environment and also our health. In Paris, the pollution rate almost reached a new record high, thus forcing the partial driving pan to clear the air of the global city. In the article, \"Paris bans driving due to smog\", its evident that cars hurt us in more ways then we realize. Buisnesses are suffering due to the lack of transportaion avaliable to delivery their services as seen in source number two, \"Delivery companies complained of lost revenue\". \"Congestion was down 60% in the capital of france after five-days of intesifying smog...\" The smog was so dense that Paris officials created a law making even-numbered license plates to leave there cars at home to reduce pollution.  In my town getting your license is a huge deal. As soon as I turned fifteen I went streight to the DMV to take my test and get to driving as soon as possible. In countries and cities such as Germany, France, and Bogota, driving is ban pretty much where ever you go. After days of near-record pollution,paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city and as a result congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five-days of intensifying smog. Smog flooded Beijing, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the entire world.  Due to citizen's of Bogota, Paris, and Germany not using cars and having to switch to bikes, walking, and electric bikes; has greatly reduced toxic gases in the environment. Due to individulas in Paris not excessively using cars the amount of smog has reduced. According to Robert Duffer \" after days of near-record pollutions, paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city( Paris bans driving due to smog 10).\" Paris has enforced strict rules that rejects people from driving, also a switch to diesel fuels. In return these ideas have lowered the level of smog in Paris creating a cleaner environment for the citizen. Not only has Paris help reduce toxic gases from entering our environment, but so has Bogota. In the article Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota, Andrew Selsky stated that this has been Bogota's \"thrid year straight that cars have been banned for one day\" and the only motorized vehicles they have used are \"buses\". This switched has dramatically cut traffic, rush hour, and the amount of smog left in the air. Although there is still traces of pollution after this day it has lowered.  In \"In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars\", author Elisabeth Rosenthal shares the story of Vauban, Germany and their efforts to reduce greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. \"Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emmisions in Europe...and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States.\" The impact of these gas emmsions is incredibly negative on cities. They make the environment unstable and unsafe for a large number of people. These numbers could easily be reduced if fewer people chose to rely on cars as their mode of transportation. In some places the pollution caused by automobiles is so high that the government is stepping in to assist in the management of city spaces. In \"Paris bans driving due to smog\", author Robert Duffer explains this specific situation in Paris, France. \"After days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city. On Monday motorists with even-numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22-euro fine ($31). The same would apply to odd-numbered plates the following day.\" The effects of this temporary ban were also shared. \"Congestion was down 60% in the capital of France, after five-days of intesifying smog.\" It is easy to see that just a small reduction of vehicles created a significant change.  \"After days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city.\" (Duffer 10). This states that the air has been getting so polluted that some cities have been temporarily banning the use of cars because of this issue. Earth has been getting too polluted and destroyed lately, to the point that some people have been trying to predict an \"end is nigh\" date due to all of these issues with earth. Scientists have been talking about global warming for years now, and the problems we have been having with the greenhouse effect and the ozone layer. \"President Obama's ambitious goals to curb the United States' greenhouse gas emissions, unveiled last week, will get a fortuitous assist from an incipient shift in American behavior: recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by.\" (Elisabeth Rosenthal 29). So it seems that the lower use of cars by Americans has been helping the atmosphere and postponing the date of the complete destruction of the ozone layer. That was why cars have such a big impact on the environment as a whole.  By limiting the amount that the citizens of the United States operate their vehicles, the condition of our environment's atmosphere will improve.\u00a0 As stated in Source 1, \"and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States.\"\u00a0 This passage is referring to the amount of greenhouse gas emitted here in America because of passenger cars.\u00a0 By not using car and taking advantage of other methods of transportation such as buses, walking, and riding a bike that number can be reduced significantly.\u00a0 In the United States we are also learning from mistakes made by other countries and cities.\u00a0 \"After days of near-record pollution,\" Source 2 says, \"Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city.\"\u00a0 A lesson can be taken from Paris of how we do not want to end up in a situation like that.\u00a0 By limiting our driving currently we can avoid having to take major steps to clean and clear our environment.\u00a0 \"It will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment, since transportation is the second largest source of America's emissions, just behind power plants,\" a sociologist predicts in Source 4.  \"Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe...and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States\", Rosenthal writes in \"In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars\". By driving less, we can reduce our greenhouse gas emissions. \"Paris bans driving due to smog,\" by Robert Duffer, is a prime example of the reduction of air pollution after limiting car usage. \"After days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city\", writes Duffer. One Friday, the smog of Paris \"rivaled Beijing, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world\". On the following Monday, motorists with even-numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a $31 fine. After only one day with less cars on the roads, the smog had nearly dissappeared. This shows that even a day with less cars can make a huge difference in the amount of air pollution. Rosenthal's article, \" The End of Car Culture\", states that many sociologists believe that if the pattern of less cars continues, \"it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment\" because transortation is America's second largest sourse of carbon emissions. Less air polution is a very important advantage of less cars.   \"Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe...and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States\" (5). In other words, cars are higly responsible for the harmful gases that pollute our atmosphere and cause global warming. In Paris,\u00a0 a partial driving ban was issued to clear the air after days of high air pollution rates. After the driving ban, \"congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France after five-days of intensifying smog\" (14). By using cars less, citizens can reduce pollution and help keep our earth clean and safe. Statisticts show that fewer people\u00a0 are using cars around the world. \"A study last year found that driving by young people decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009\" (41). Sociologists belive that this trend will continue and possibly increase. They belive it will \"have benficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment, since transportation is the second largest source of America's emissions\" (34). ",

                "content": "About twenty-five years ago, something happened around Mars. NASA, snapped photos of the object. On Mars, there is a face printed on the plant. People think it was created by aliens. NASA said it was created on it's own. Scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa. Those are common around Cydonia. A couple of days later NASA saw a nose, eyes, and a mouth.  In 1976 the face looked like a face. In 1998 it started to not look like a face at all. In 2001 it just looked like a rock. So i believe that it was not created by aliens but that it was just something the olanet had made itself. This has certainly got the attention of the people.  The \"Face on Mars\" is not a face. If you look at the pictures from 1976, and 1998, and 2001 and in the text it says that the photo from 2001 is the most recent photo that NASA has. It still looks nothing like a face so since the 2001 picture is the most recent it shows that it is just a natural landform. It is just a natural landform. On Mars there are natural landforms everywhere and the fade away. Here on earth natural landforms are created everyday.  The curiousity about Mars has been going on for centuries.  People say that there is or once was life on Mars, and now they are saying that there is a face on Mars.  Humans all around the world have questioned whether the \"Face\" was created by aliens or just a natural landform.  During july 1976 it would have been winter on mars at the time. So that means the storms on mars could have casted a shadow.  Mars has been a planet that we have been exploring for many years. We have discovered many abnormal objects on the planet. In 1976, we took a picture of the region Cydonia, and we found something that seemed to look like a human face. Our eyes are adapted to recognizing faces and that is why we recognized the face on Mars more easily. Higher quality images that were taken in 2001 show that the face on Mars is no sign of ancient civilization on Mars but in fact a mesa.  n paragraph 10 it says,\" ...43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo.\" This shows that the photo didn't give very compelling evidence that there was life on Mars. soon later NASA and their supporters claimed that this face is just an act of nature is because of the 1998 Global Surveyor spacecraft. This new spaceship passed over the red planet to take pictures of the \"face on Mars\". The pictures were ten times better than the last pictures of Cydonia this time. The new photos clearly showed a landform on Mars and not a man.  The first picture that was taken of the face on Mars was taken in 1976 and the quality back then was not as good as it is now. The picture that was taken in 2001 was a higher quality picture and scientists figured out that is was just a mesa and not a sign of any ancient civilization on Mars. For example the camera used in 1976, spanned 43 meters compared to the camera NASA used in 2001 spanned 1.56 meters. In the picture of 1976, the shadows that were present that day formed an illusion that made it seem like there was a face. In paragraph two of the article \"Unmasking the Face on Mars\" it says that, \"Scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia, only this one had unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh.\"  In 1976 NASA released a photo of a landform on Mars resembling a human face. Not everyone was easily convinced that it was only just a landmass though. Conspiracy theorists believed that it was, \"Bona fide evidence of life on Mars.\" In the article \"Unmasking the Face on Mars,\" the author, Garvin, believed that it was only a mesa.  In paragraph 12, Garvin said, \" It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about thye sane height as the Face on Mars.\" Jim Garvin is saying that these formations on Mars are very similar to the ones that we have here on Earth. He is also saying that there os no face on Mars.  For example, the Face was found in an area of Mars called Cydonia. Cydonia is actually known for its common Martian Mesas. This means that it isn't too shocking that it is natural. ",

You ask them for things to help you make your choice. I want people behind me to help me after I make my choice. If the choice knocks me down in any way, I want people to be there to support me. If I talk to multiple people, I know all of those people will help me if I fall. No one wants to feel alone after their choice. I would only make a tough choice if I was certain I had at least one person to help me. If I talked to more than one person, I know at least one of them will be able to support me because they helped me. They know what I was going through when I was making this choice  Every human being has been in the situation of needing or receiving help from someone.  Whether it's asking advice from your grandpa, mom or brother, as a human, none of us are perfect and we need to receive advice from someone.  Seeking advice from one person is great, but have you ever thought about why people ask more than one person for advice?  Trash would clutter lots, homeless people and animals would have nowhere to go and the elderly wouldn't get the assistance they need like when some one walks them down the street. or helps them up or down stairs. with out the community's help many people and animals would suffer or go with out. And that could hurt a community very badly. And it pains most students to see these poor people and innocent animals suffer or have to live in such filthy conditions. that's why we ask for community service it makes the community and are self's feel better. So why don't you allow the children who want to help, help.  Helping the elderly can help them. Maybe their too weak to carry their own bags and they need help. A lot of elderly people now a days are dying because their trying to do chores they can't really do but they have to do because no one is their to help them do them.  For example if an emergency occurs and someone is trying to get a hold of you, you would need your cell phone to stay in contact. Another example is if you are lost you can call someone for directions  Everyone has found themselves in that sticky situation where you just don't know what to do. There are so many problems running through your mind and so many ways to solve them. Your head is jumbled up, and you can't think straight anymore. You start stressing out and sweating and you just have absolutely no idea what do to!  In this scenario most people go to their friends and family for help. They ask as many people as they can to give them advice to help them make the best choice.  People can be Indecisive, It could be a decision between going on vacation with your family or helping your friend with something they're struggling with, or some other really difficult decision. When this comes up, people normally ask for help, but how much help do you need, and who should you ask?  Everybody needs to know that our world needs to get better and cleaner. Littering is probably the worst thing out there that you can do. Something needs to change because when you just walk outside of your house there's a piece of trash and you can help by just picking that piece up. If you could get all the students doing community service then those students could inspire other students or even their brothers, sisters or even their own parents. If just one person could help pick up a little trash then imagine what ten or even fifty people could do this world would be better in no time if everybody could just pitch in a little of there time everyday by making the world a little better.  It's all in your control. Depending on what the choice is, it may effect people's daily lifes (in a positive way).` What people do like is changes that benefit them. The choice you made could change the routine of the person's daily life, they may have less to do on their time or maybe something that they are offered that could be nice. There is usually emergencies where someone need help from a fire or a robber, but you could prevent the disaster from happening. Finally, all of this makes you look like a caring human being. All humans would be grateful for the time that you have sacrificed for a beneficial choice to all, because you asked for multiple opinions, and you understood. This has all happened because you cared for others opinions.  for example say someone wishes to clean up the trash polluting the community and the land around it in this case the service is needed its good for the community, the school, and the wild-life. Or if their going to help out at a shelter or a church, the service is needed greatly for the homeless, animals, and elderly. And the school which is part of the community should help with donations, food drives, and clothing banks. community service is greatly needed everywhere, since others cant do it by themselves its best to give are neighbors a had every once in a while. That's why we need community service its good for the community and school. ",

                "content": "Several students need to be in a classroom to fully understand a topic, and in most cases, learning in a classroom, outside of one's home, can be highly beneficial for certain subjects. Physics, for example, includes many experiments in its curriculum, coverin topics like sound waves. A student may have difficulty understanding sound waves through a virtual laboratory experiment, a factor that distance learning does consider because such programs choose to use one resource for all students, despite there being different types of learners, such as audio, visual, and kinesthetic. In public and private schools, however, teachers offer a variety of resources, including textbooks for visual learners, educational videos for audio learners, and phsyical, not virtual, laboratory experiments for kinesthetic learners. This, in turn, helps all students better comprehend the curriculum.  The freedom to make a hot cup of coffee while writing a book report, or watch a television series while doing math, undoubtedly sparks feelings of content among students. Throughout the country, some schools have worked to make this a reality, offering students the option of 'distance learning', which is a means by which students can take classes from home through online or video conferencing. In the 21st century, technological development is playing an increasingly larger role in several aspects of society, including educational institutions. The question of how and to what extent these innovations should be integrated serves as a subject for debate  Which might cause them not being able to video conference,or work on assignements and big projects that need high quality of internet connection. Many students learn better in person instead of using the computer or video conference. Throughout teaching assignements,teachers might have a hard time explaining or giving details about a specific topic through online classes because they might be used to speaking in front of a class in person.  In a student's home they have access to toys and electronics such as phones, televisions, and computers that can take their attention away from learning. However if students took classes in a school building they would not have access to as many of these distracting things, and they would also have a teacher that would be able to take any distractions they find away from them. Another way that distance learning would allow students to become easily distracted is because their is no other students around to keep them on task. By taking their classes inside of a school building students would be surrounded by other students who are also doing work. Being surrounded by other students who are also doing their work will help motivate students to continue to focus on their own assignments. Personally, I prefer to do my homework at school, in my study hall period, as opposed to completing it at home. I would rather do my work at school because I am surrounded by other students that motivate me to finish my work, and also their is less distractions around me. One specific example of how doing my work in school benefits me is when I had to complete my history project on Andrew Jackson. Instead of working on my project during my study hall period, I decided to take a nap and told myself that I would be able to finish the project at home. However, when I got home, instead of working on my project, I was immediately distracted by the television and ended up watching a six episodes of one television show instead of finishing my project. When I received my grade back on the project I saw that I had received a C+ instead of my usual A. If I would have completed my project in study hall I would have been more focused on doing the project, due to the other students also working on assignments around me, and I would have received a better grade.   Students are often young and their brains have the power to rapidly grasp and process information. However, this ability can be negatively affected especially when the student is in an environment that they are well acquainted with. A well known area where students have limited interactions can dull their curiosity and aspirations for learning, causing boredom. This boredom is able to take over a young student's malleable mind and replace curiosity with distraction. In a world where technology is ubiquitous and can bring the world to one's fingertips, students would much rather research the latest scores of a basketball game or catch up on celebrity gossip, than they would learn about the Pythagorean theorem. At home, a student's mind is able to roam around freely, especially without an instructor prohibiting such distractions. Making it less likely that students are being attentive to the subject being taught on an online forum that limits their participation in the class. Therefore, students will not benefit from attending online classes at home as they will get easily distracted by the comforts in their home.  The lack of a teacher's presence removes the student's feeling of accountability and students often do not put in the effort to learn the class material. Online courses enable students to take tests and quizzes from home, but many cheat or plagiarize material from the internet rather than doing their work honestly. In fact, the issue had become so rampant that when students take an in-person end-of-semester exam in Generic_School, if they score significantly lower than they did on their at-home tests, they are believed to have been cheating the entire year and are required to resume the class in school rather than online. This goes to show that this is not an isolated issue; it is widespread and supremely damaging to students' grades, work ethic, and potentially even their academic transcripts.  Projects, presentations and intellectual conversations would be removed from the learning realm, and would be replaced with watching videos and staring at a computer all day. Technology has been proven to be unhealthy to adults and especially teenagers. It has rotted our brains, shortened our attention span, and removed our creativity. Our generation has been revolved around technology, and has set the stage for the future. It is no doubt that one day their will come a time when students no longer come to school to talk to their peers and learn from their teachers, but instead learn from robots, in their dark rooms, only lightened by their computer screens and cell phones. Coming to school and sitting in a classroom, where are phones zipped in our backpacks and our laptops shut, is refreshing and healthy for teenagers. With online classroom, students would not be able to take physical education and run in the fresh air, and have a break from the technology they stare at throughout the day. If we were to take online classes from home we would be constantly hovered over our computer screens, diminishing our creativity and forgetting what school used to mean.   By having teachers design the summer projects, they can readdress concepts that students need practice with or struggled with last school year so they will not be troubled by it in the future. For example, in the book  Counting By 7s , the main character excells at history. Although she excells in that subject, she has trouble with other subjects. A teacher-designed summer project for her may be focused on math and writing while her student-designed project would have been based on history, which may help her retain that knowledge, but does not help her with subjects she truly needs practice with. In addition, teacher-designed summer projects can have students learn new material that will be used in the upcoming school year. Teachers are aware of what will be taught in a course next whereas students are not. These summer projects would allow students to prepare ahead of time for the school year by reaffirming previous knowledge and learning new information directed towards the course. Many educational resources are only for teacher use or are not accessible to students prior to the school year, such as syallbuses and requirements for a course, Khan Academy, and other study sites, allowing teachers to be more effective in designing summer projects than students. Having the summer to complete teacher-designed summer projects will allow students to expand their knowledge on topics they need to learn or struggled with so they are prepared for the coming school year.  A teacher who knows their students can better tailor the lessons to them based on their learning styles and needs. For example, a teacher could dedicate more time in class to review logarithmic functions with games or act out  Romeo and Juliet to help the students better understand the concepts. Activities such as these that are beneficial to students are not possible through distance learning, and could harm a student's level of understanding about a topic. Additionally, it is harder for students to get help when they do not understand new material or need clarification through distance learning. Traditionally, students can ask their teachers questions, visit their teachers during their office hours or study hall, or meet with a peer tutor. For distance learning, a student would have to video call or email their teacher, but it is much harder to explain or understand concepts without being able to meet in person.  Students are forced to learn in classrooms with another 20-30 students. Some students have trouble concentrating with so many of their peers present. There will be less people at a time in online classes, so they can learn better and acquire a better grasp on concepts, as there are less distracting factors. The primary benefit, however, is for students with social anxiety, those who feel intimidated by the presence of others, which is more common than one might think. Those who say social anxiety can be reduced by being around large quantities of people at a time do not understand the mechanisms of anxiety. Sometimes time is the best remedy; being forced to indulge in conversation with their peers will only be an obstacle to students with anxiety-related issues. This obstruction is eliminated in distance learning. ",

Every person has his own abilities to do a certain thing or class. This is not fair to the people who are not good at everything. If they are not good at it that does not mean that they have to be kicked of the team.    When students are absent, they are absent for a reason, whether good or bad.  They are not able or willing to attend school, and they are not going to attend online classes from home.   You can get advice from lots of different people, it can be good, or it can be bad. In elementary school I got into deep trouble because this guy was messing with someone else, I told him to stop, but he just started picking on me, but since I was in elementary school, he said something that caused me to break, so when he started to turn around, I picked up a rock and I chucked it at his back, luckily it missed, but I still got in trouble. The reason I did that was because my brother said if they hurt you, even with words, hit them back, that's some bad advice I followed. That's why I say right now, take advice that will lead you into the right direction, advice that won't cause any trouble, in middle school I'm surprised I haven't gone insane yet because there are some kids I want punch in the face because they mention race or call people names, but there is some advice I've been told that keeps me calm. One is these guys are my age, they can say what they want, but they are still my age, they can't do anything about it. Another is in the future I probably won't even see these guys, so once I tell myself that, I start to feel better and I show them that I could care less to what they are saying  If they choose to be in a club or any other school activity that requires them to do community service then they would have to or be kicked out of that club, if not then they should not have to.  In a happy school, many people are more likely to get good grades. Studies show that when a student is in a happier or more welcoming environment tend to do better on tests, quizzes, and homework than children who are in an unhappy environment studying. If we take the student who is good at their sport and make them quit the team just because they have a bad grade, then we would be making a bad environment for the people who want the team to win and succeed, and that would affect how they learned and studied. This would not be good for the schools' public image because every school wants to look good. If we start to make our school look very bad just because a sports team lost which they thought would win but didn't, that might make many of our students feel bad and a bit disappointed. Students should be able to work in a healthy environment where they don't have bad sports teams to be ashamed of, but good ones to be proud of.  These lessons we learn, will hopefully pay off, such as getting reprimanded for doing something bad.  Do you think someone who is extremely bad, for example someone who is always getting in trouble in school for misbehaving, should be allowed to be rewarded?  Well that is not right because he thinks that he can be bad and do anything he wants and still be rewarded in the end.  He is not being taught anything and it isn't fair.  How would you feel if you were a student who did good in school, got good grades, and tried your hardest while some other student did bad and took the easy way out and was rewarded in the same way?  In 2017 students who are active in their community and school were proven to have better SOL, SAT, and just overall grades. GPAs in Colleges have been harder to meet as far as the 110% of all the valedictorians from high schools\u00a0around the globe. Getting involved in out of or in school activities can look good on job applications, college applications, and can just generally give you motive when you are having a hard time in life. Professor at the University of Utah in Northern Canada, Jillian Hooper explains, \"Everyday I see students struggle with their grades, and everyday the only ones who can bounce back are those who take a break, and spend time volunteering, practicing a sport, or any other extracurricular activity, it's vital for these college students.\" She wants people to understand that activities can be beneficial.  Most students parents have and office job. The average work time is from 9am to 5pm, and school gets out at around 2pm- 4pm, so most kids are left unsupervised for around 2-6 hours. Kids left alone can get into all sorts of trouble and can be persuaded to do things that they know they should not do. Kids can be convinced to do drugs, join gangs, and vandalize public property. Instead of doing these things they can be supervised at school doing something that is fun and enjoyable instead of being mischievous. The school environment would be much safer because students wouldnt be influenced be other people to do any bad things, so they would not be doing or selling drugs and they would not be in or associated\u00a0with a gang. Therefore, students would not bring in bad things into our schools.  While schools have students pledge to an honor code, cheating is inevitable in almost very student to step foot in high school. Without the physical supervision of a teacher, cheating can become a staple in one's everyday school life, if it hasn't already. A student can potentially use an online source, secret notes, or another person in the room to help them with their assignments. Cheating is essentially a form of lying as well, which is a reason why it shouldn't be done. A second bad habit that could develop would be procrastination. Procrastination is already seen often with students who go to a regular educational institution, so online education would make matters even worse. Having potentially flexible time frames can cause students to want to postpone doing their work for another time. This can eventually add up to a student having an enormous debt of assignments, waiting to be completed. Following this procrastination, a third bad habit, laziness, develops  First however, I believe some background knowledge is required. As you know already, a C grade average is considered average in most of our country, where as a B or an A average are considered above average, and outstanding, respectively. Also, as you may know already, most of the student body retains a C average. Your change in school policy would mean that everybody who is currently participating in school activities would be kicked out of them until new term grades come in at which point they may only hope that they did well enough to continue their sport. Our competitive would all fail do to the almost complete rooting of the students. Now this may only last a term, but who knows how long it might take to raise your grade average by a whole letter? You obviously went to school when you were a child, and I assume you enjoyed the extra curricular clubs which your school had to offer. Now imagine this. Imagine that you learned that you had to maintain an A or B average to continue in these sports. Now this was one of the years where you didn't do so well, and therefore got a C average. Wouldn't such a thing be detrimental to you? It would cause you to be kicked out of every activity which you participated in unless you managed to raise your grade! That is one the main points I am putting forth. ",

Sometimes people are busy all the time, like, people that do sports after school, some of them don't get out of there sports practice or games after sometime, mostly around 9:00pm. Personally, people are great for doing after school activities, but I'm not one of those people, and I will never be, unless its something with basketball, or an activity that I'd want to do on my free time, but it usually waists a lot of free time, and I'm one of those people that like to do homework, especially since I get a lot of it. So what I'm trying to say is, we have a life too, were not always just on our technology 24/7, were actually trying to do things that are good for us.  Some students have trouble socializing with others. So maybe they didn't apply for an activity because they just didn't want too. Some students also enjoy their free time, time where they can do homework, be on their electronic devices, or just take a nap. So they didn't want to do an extracurricular activity because they didn't want to give up their free time. Students shouldn't have to feel like they are forced to do something. I mean it is called extracurricular activity for a reason, because it's for extra credit, so it shouldn't be a mandatory thing that they have to do.  There's another reason why it could affect the use of homework. When you have such a tight schedule (which can be harder to those who play sports or clubs) your only option is to do your homework at night. Which is really bad because students end up having less hours of sleep, which is required for a good healthy day. Homework should be done right after school, but with this new task it wouldn't be possible.  Did you know that teachers assign kids with loads of homework? If you didn't then now you do. Here at my school I get home and it takes me a couple of hours to get my homework done. I was very disappointed when I was told that every student has to take part in one extracurricular activity. If this time is taken away from students it will take away time for them to do their homework. If kids start not having time to do their homework their grades may drop, which could make them depressed, and it could affect their behavior at school. If a students grade drops their parents may get mad which would make them sad and upset which could lead to them doing something hurtful or bad to themselves. It could also affect their behavior at school by making them not pay attention and start getting into mischief. If students have to stay after-school for an extra activity, it takes away time for homework which kids need to do and if they dont have the time bad things may happen.  Having a friend who is online-schooled, who admits frequently that he has ample free time, which he wastes on playing video games and watching TV, while at the same time, students in the classroom are made to do tedious book-work, is very eye-opening to a pressing issue. Students who take classes online have more time to slack off and goof around, and for the less-disciplined child, this will reflect negatively in their grades  It's 9pm, you haven't finished your homework. You would've finished your homework, if you had the choice to go straight home. However, the extra curricular you have to participate in, took too much time. That's the view of a student, if they would have to participate in a extracurricular activity. Students would have no time to play their Xbox, and have no time to finish that 8 paragraph essay, if they had to participate in a extracurricular\u00a0activitiy  in middle school, there's a lot of homework, even more so in high school. A lesson is usually about an hour and a half long. School ends at 3:30, so they'd get home at 5:00. 5 or 6 is the most common dinner time, and it usually lasts about 30 minutes. That's 5:30. Then, they have to go and try to finish their homework. If they have a lot of it, it can take a long time, and can usually lead to them putting off important stuff, like personal hygiene (GROSS!). They're probably super exhausted from their activity, and just want to take a shower. But nope, they have to do the rest of their homework. Depending on how much they have, they could end up staying up really late. Highschoolers can usually end up staying up until 3 am in the morning doing homework. That makes them more tired and not ready to focus the next day. It could've saved them so much more if they didn't have to do the activity.  A frantic middle schooler had just received a load of homework from all of her teachers. Packets upon worksheets upon study guides that all needed to be done tonight. If she had to stay after school\u00a0there would be no time for chores that needed to be done and the homework. Children and parents have the right to choose if they would want to do after school. Not all parents and students would agree with having after school mandatory. Is having a madatory after school really benificial.  Many of these theories include that they just have too much energy and can't stay focused, or these children have bad time management and so they don't do their homework or complete their assignments. Clubs and sports can allow the underachievers to get out some of their excess energy, so they can stay on task and perform better. When they are practicing four days a week with games on the weekend, kids don't have times to dilly-dally, so they learn time management and perform better in class. ",

                "content": "While talking about different approaches to studying Venus the author states, \"...simplified electronics...have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface and have lasted for three weeks...\". This quote also helps the reader understand that studying Venus can be done in a safe and harmless way. Using this new technology could help research on Venus advance, and keep those doing the research out of harm's way. The author then goes on to talk about a different technology that was used in World War 2 that can also be used as a new method to study Venus. These are called mechanical computers, and they use gears and levers rather than the electronics that actual computers use. The mechanical computers are made of mechanical parts which are stronger, so they shouldn't be damaged as easily. These are just a few of the ways technology can help safely advance the study of Venus.   The author also states, \"Some simplified electronics... have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface and have lasted for three weeks in such conditions\" (7). The author backs up her idea by using these electronics, that can survive three weeks on venus, to once again show that we can get through to venus. Science and technology being able to help us properly function on Venus shows that the planet is a worthy pursuit. Ultimately, the author backs up her idea by giving evidence on the different ways landing on Venus is possible.  In paragraph 7, it says, \"some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface and have lasted for three weeks in such conditions.\" This shows that they are already testing new methods that could possibly survive on Venus. In paragraph 7, it says, \"Another project is looking back to an old technology called mechanical computers...system that use mechanical parts can be made more resistant to pressure, heat, and other forces.\" This proves that they are using all resources that even date back to the 1800s.  The author also disscusses other potential solutions, such as possibly using silicon carbide, a material that has \"been tested in a chmaber simulating the chaos of Venus' surface and [has] lasted for three weeks in such conditions,\" (7). These all are possible ways to make a trip to Venus much safer and, more importantly, they all help support the author's claim.  When talking about something as dangerous as exploring another planet, it is easy to see that our Earth bound technology simply cannot do the job. in paragraph 5 of the article, the author describes an idea that was thought up by \"The National Aeronautics and Space Administartion\". This idea is to have humans 30 or so miles above Venus for exploration. The author claims how this would be beneficial in keeping humans safe from the Venusian landscape. However, The author does not support this idea well, as he goes on to say how not much exploration can be done from there, and the conditions would still be extremely dangerous but \"survivable\". Also in paragraph 7, the author explains how NASA is working on other approaches to study Venus. He explains how they are working on some simplified electronics, made of silicon carbide, that have been testedd in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface. This may sound like a good thing, but it is far from one. This is because the author finsihes by saying that the electronics lasted only three weeks. If a computer can't withstand Venus's conditions longer than three weeks, I am very doubtful that a human can. This proves my point that our technology is far too inadvanced for such a task like exploring another planet. Therefore supporting my claim that the author did a poor job in supporting this idea.  In Paragraph 8, the author claims, \"Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiousity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors.\" The author brought up the word \"challenge\" again,  When discussing the potential plans to explore the planet, the author states \"Many researches are working on innovations that would allow our machines to last long enough to contribute meaningfully to our knowledge of Venus.\" This quote makes it clear to the audience that scientists are doing whatever it takes to develop multiple, efficient plans for space travel. The author also goes onto provide different examples to further convey how close scientists are to developing the safest plan possible. They specifically mention the use of simplified electronics made of silicon carbide and explain how they've already been tested in a chamber that simulate the conditions of Venus's surfaces, yet how they're still being improved upon. They also describe an old technology called mechanical computer, noting how this technology has already been used frequently in the 1940's and how it can be incorporated into space travel now. The author has given detailed descriptions of the efforts made and the options available to provide a safe embarkment for humans to support the ideas that Venus is a worthy pursit.  The author also brought up the dangers of visiting Venus multiple times. Then, he would proceed to follow the statement with tested and untested solutions. It was hard to tell which way he sided  NASA's advancements for Venus exploration are promising, \"For example, some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface and have lasted for three weeks in such chaos,\" (7). Humans would not be able to use the most advanced technology, but durability is the goal, \"By comparison, systems (mechanical computers that use gears and levers to calculate) that use mechanical parts can be made more resistant to pressure, heat, and other forces,\" (7). If humans were to only hover over Venus, the possibilites are limited. Humans and technology have to be as close as possible. Technology that could last for a few weeks is enough to vastly expand our knowledge. Mechanical computers are now obsolete, but in Venus would be a valuable tool, just like the other electonics being made. Researchers have worked tirelessly to continue making Venus exploration a reasonable reality.  But there could be more than what meets the eye. In parapgraph six, the writer says that,\" peering a Venus from a ship orbiting or hovering safely far above the planet can provide only limited insight on ground conditions becuase most forms of light cannot penetrate the dense atmosphere.\" ",

I understand that under the  Electoral College system,voters vote not for the president but for a slate of electors,who turn elect the president. If you lived in texas for instance and wanted to vote for john kerry you'd vote for a slate of 34 democratic electors pledged to kerry,On the off-chance that those electors won the statewide election they would go to congress and kerry would get 34 lectoral votes. Each candidate running for president in your state has his or her own group of electors. The electors are generally chosen by the candidates,s political party, but state laws vary on how the electors are selected and what their reponsibilities are. At the most basic level the  Electoral College is unfair to voters because of the winner take all system in each state,canidatdes dont spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning.  Election by popular vote for the president of the  United States  Obama received 61.7 percent of the electoral votes compared to only 51.3 percent of the popular votes cast for him and romney becausw almost all states award electoral votes on a winner take all basis even a very slight plurality in a state creates a landslide electoral vote victory in that state. A tie in a nationwide electoral vote is possible because the total number of votes 538 is an even number,but it is highly unlikely but each party selcts a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee it is entirely possible that the winner of the electoral vote will not win the national popular vote. Yet that has happened very rarely. It happened in 2000, when Gore had more popular votes than bush yet fewer electoral votes,but that was the first time since 1888 thats happened. there are five reasons for reraining the electoral college despite its lackof democratic pedigree all practical reasons not liberal or conservative reasons. A disput ove routcome of an electoral college vote is possible it happened in 2000 but it's less likley than a dispute over the popular vote. ",

This system was created by the founding fathers as a compromise between the congressional vote and the popular vote. However there was a reason for this new, seperated voting system. During their time the founding fathers where among the most educated men in the country. Back then education was not standard and very few people could read or write. The founding fathers did not want uneducated citizens voting on the individual who would lead the country. So they created a system where the uneducated would vote for a group of educated men, who would in turn vote on a president. Thus the electoral college was born.  As said in the article, \"What Is The Electoral College?\", \"The Electoral College process consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for President and Vice President, and the counting of the electoral votes by Congress.\" That is a huge amount of work but that is what keeps the elections well organized. Each candidate running for President in a state has their own group of electors. After each election, the governor of your state prepares a certificate presenting all of the candidates that ran for your state. As stated in the article by the Office of the Federal Register, \"The Certificate of Ascertainment also declares the winning presidential candidate in your state and shows which electors will represent your state at the meeting of the electors in December of the election year.\" The Electoral College is what mantains everything professional.  I am writing this letter to you today to talk to you about Electoral College and election by popular vote. I feel very strongly on this topic as it is something I\u00a0 know I\u00a0 will come in contact with when i have the right to vote in the near future.  As we look back to the very day the Constitution was written, it has been a comprise that between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizen that fifve hundred and thirty eight electorshave a meeting for they vote for President and Vice President, and the counting of the electoral votes by Congress, as stated by the Office of the Federal Register.  The Electoral College has served us for more than a century in determining our nation's new president. \"The Electoral College process consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for President and Vice President, and the counting of the electoral votes by Congress,\" states the article \"What Is the Electoral College?\" written by the Office of the Federal Register. This means that we do not vote directly vote for our new president, but instead vote for electors that vote for a candidate running for office. Though many individuals are in favor of keeping the Electoral College, if kept, it will continue to cause problems in our nation.  Third, according to the Al Gore-thanks to the quirks of the electoral college- won the popular vote but lost the presidency, over 60 percent of the voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now  The Electoral College is a flawed system used to elect presidents, and the American voting system should be based on popular vote  Under the Electoral College, it is entirely possible for a Presidential Candidate to win presidency, even with the majority of voters voting for the oposing candidate. We should discard the Electoral College in favor of the popular vote.   Voters don't actually vote for the president, instead, they vote for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president  While some may still believe that the Electoral College is outdated and unneccesary, the usefulness of the swing states, its transregional approval system, and its certainty over popular voting proves it to be the best method of selecting our presidents for now and for the future.       \u00a0       \u00a0     Replacing the electoral college with popular votes would be better for elections of presidents because, it's the peoples choice.

Having a popular vote lets the citizens in big states that are metaphorically already \"chosen\" allows the minority vote to maybe have a chance in the office. Last but not least, it is understood that having the electoral college decreases wrong-doings, but if the elector chosen by the state changes his intentions just for himself, that gives the state no word about it.     First, voters can walk into the booth and \"...get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate\" (Plumer 10). Not every voter is educated on exactly how the electors and candidates are represented on the ballot and that may lead to an accidental win. On top of this misconception, almost decietfully, an elector promised to a candidate can change their vote at a moments notice(Plumer 10). Even Posner who writes for the electoral college admitted that it is possible, and he claims that it is \"rare\";however, it has happened before in 1960 (Plumer 11), and not even Posner can control the actions of an elector, legally anyway. Also, when a candidate wins a popular vote, which is the true mind of the people, that candidate still may not win the electoral vote, overall, loosing the election. This happened just a few years back in the 2000 election between President Bush and Gore(Posner 16).All in all, the electoral college does not represnt the people.  Yet they are mistaken because clearly our popular vote can override this system if necessary. Though it is very rare most will argue, the fact that it is possible to not allow the Electoral College to take control of our government proves that the power is really all in the hands of the citizens. Clearly, the ''unfair'' picture most perceive is largely mistaken  To conclude I belive that my state senator should remove the electoral colleges. To change the election by popular vote for the president of the United States. For the fact that voters vote not for the president but for a slate of electors. Who can always defy the will of the people. It should also be removed because its simply unfair to the voters. There votes may or may not be counted or may vote for the wrong person or oppsite party. The Electoral College is unfair, outdated, and irrational.     It is still possible to have a tie though because there are 538 total votes and since that is an even number then it can happen. And if there is just a stlight difference and instead the electoral college creates a landslide then that isn't representing the actuall number of the votes by the people. Once again you are being cheated out of your sya it the election. The hardest thing to understand is why people would still support something that doesn't support them. The electoral college basically throws away your votes and replaces them with theirs. And once again, it is possible for ties in the electoral college due to the even number of votes.  There has been some conterversy between whether we should keep the Electoral College or changing the election to popular vote for the president. There are pros and cons to each method of voting. The Electoral College has been around since the beginning of our country. Most of the time it is successful (there have been a few times problems have occured but rarely it happens). As time has passed and we enter a more modern age, people have started to feel that the Electoral College does not work and we should all switch to just a regular popular vote.  In conclusion, the Electoral College seems unconstitutional, since a variety of issues can occur due to the many problems that could potentially occur. The United States should shift into a more reasonable and logical means of electing our president in our Republic, where everybody is equal. The Electoral College should no longer decide the president based on the possibility of a tie, the possibility for betrayal of trust and disputes due to how close the votes are. The system should change to where the popular opinion should\u00a0 decide on the president of the United States of America, making people believe that their vote will be fairly counted.  Electoral College should be abolished because the electors may help ruin the president election and large states are not vistied or spoken to from the president other than small states. Electoral college may seem an unfair disadvantage for most voters many of their campaign that they want to win can be rather at a disadvantage or advantage depending on their electors,\u00a0 many electors may betray their campaign because they're not pubilicly held in office. Lastly the disadvantage is that many voters want to see what and how they are going to change or improve their well being, but most electors and campaigns do not visit the states that want view and know the candidates better. The electoral College should be abolished for the matter of the voter and the United States of America. In my opinion we should be allowed to vote on our own, for example instead of voting for an elector we should just vote on the type of campagin whose better and meet our daily bases needs.   Source 3 states, \"...each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee (and that truth is barely betrayed)... however it is entirely possible that the winner of the electoral vote will not win the national popular vote.\" For instance, if the people vote for candidates for the electoral college, and the majority of them are not what the majority of the people wanted, or they lied about being pledged to a candidate for president, then there is still a chance that the candidate that the people did want could be elected, by the national popular vote. Also, the people that are against the electoral college shouldn't be, because the electoral college is not definite. Just because the electoral colleg votes for a certain candidate, does not guarantee that the overall national vote will be that person.  I believe that we shouldn't change the Electoral College for popular votes the way we arevoting now is working just fine and it makes it so larger states like Texas don't get more of an impact on the election because of thier population than smaller states like Rhode Island. Also the Electoral College prevents Run-off elections. Even though some believe the Electoral College as an anachronism I think that the Electoral College is still a good way of voting. ",

                "content": "It does look like it could be from another living organism, but it's just a rock on the planet. In our newest image of the rock, it turns out that the face has dissapered. There is no evidence of this being created by aliens, rather it was created by wind and water that has been found on Mars. The reason you might believe that this was indeed aliens, might be the fact that the news has blown it out of poportion. It's just the rock that had some interesting shadows and holes that made it look like a human face.  There you have it. The Face sadly wasn't built by aliens, it was just a natural landform that happened to have some pretty neat features to it due to shadows. There is no way around it, because the pictures don't lie. It is even more obvious that it is a landform because ones just like it exist on Earth! Even though it would've been very interesting for it to have been actually created by aliens, it was just a natural landform in the end.  The author states that scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa when the face appeared. This shows that they have seen things like this before and they knew that it wasn't real, or alien like. Another example that the author proves is that Garvin said it reminded him of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. The camera on board MGS had to peer through wispy clouds to see the face and perhaps alien markings were hidden by haze. Also NASA can be hidding information about the Face. But, you can see that the Face is formed by shadows, and not an alien haze.  Conspiracy theorist were fast to make speculations that this was ancient alien architecture or something of the sort. But NASA said that the face was just a geograghical coincidence, and there is no alien stucture on Mars.  In conclusion, some people may think there is alien life on Mars because of past picture or conspiracy theories. No one can denty however, that NASA has proven the Face to be nothing but a natural landform on the Red Planet Mars. NASA has proven this by recent pictures, scientific evidence, and real-life examples and measurements. Over the years, NASA has worked hard to figure out the mystery of the face, and just recently they have discovered, with pictyures, evidence, and measruements, that the Face is just a natural landform with unusual shadowing formed on the Red Planet Mars.  The \"face\" isn't any perticular shape that any man or alien would want. The landform would be shaped as a circle, square or any other simple shape, and it would not be so ridgid and cracked. If you were to look at the photo furthest to the left, you would assume that it resembled a face, but If you compair that photo to the one taken twenty-five years later, you would begin to understand that to photo was out-dated and that the camera was not as clear as the one taken later. In addition, why would an alien make a structure of a human's face.   Aliens never made the Face of Mars and the Face of Mars isn't real at all! It's just a natural landform by having the shadows covering up most of the landform making it appear as a face. For the conclusion, Cydonia has a natural landform on it that appears itself as a face using the shadows to make the illusion.  In conclusion, the face is just a natural landform. It may look like a head, but that is just because of the unusual shadows that the mesa has. If my co-workers and I thought this was actually proof of alien life, why would we hide it from you? What is the point in hiding that kind of information?  In 1976 the face looked like a face. In 1998 it started to not look like a face at all. In 2001 it just looked like a rock. So i believe that it was not created by aliens but that it was just something the olanet had made itself. This has certainly got the attention of the people.  The \"Face on Mars\" is not a face. If you look at the pictures from 1976, and 1998, and 2001 and in the text it says that the photo from 2001 is the most recent photo that NASA has. It still looks nothing like a face so since the 2001 picture is the most recent it shows that it is just a natural landform. It is just a natural landform. On Mars there are natural landforms everywhere and the fade away. Here on earth natural landforms are created everyday.  The world today contains numerous conspiracy theories. One of these conspiracies is about the mysterious face on Mars. Some conspiracy theorists state that the face on Mars is actually a result of Alien life. ",

                "content": "That can't be right, yet it has happened plently of times before. It's even unfair to the people, who sometimes don't even get to see their electors. Because of the winner-take-all system in each state, they don't focus of states they know they cannot win, aiming towards \"swing states.\" In the 2000 campaign, 17 states didn't see their candidates at all, as well as 25 of the largest media markets who didn't get to see not one campaign ad.   According to source 3, \"Knowing their vote will have no effect, they have less incentive to pay attention to the campaign than they would have if the president were picked by popular vote.\" Larger states are paid the most attention to by canidates because they will receive more votes than compared to the number of votes a smaller state would produce. This causes smaller states to have less interest in the campaign because they know they have a lesser chance of their favored canidate winning. Even more, canidates focus on swing states. Swing states are states that can be easily convinced for votes. It is important for all states to focus on the campaign so that an unworthy or unprepared canidate is not chosen for presidency, but only large and swing states are paying attention.  Because of the \"winner-take-all system in each state\", the candidates don't take time to go to other states that they know they will lose, they only really focus on the \"swing\" states. For example, during the 2000 campaign, seventeen statesdidn't see the candidates in their state at all, also 25 of the largest media markets had not seen a single campaign ad from a candidate. Also it's unfair because voters don't really know who to vote for because they see no campaign ads and candidates don't show up to their state and tell them what he/she is running for. That's why the Electoral College is unfair to voters of the presidential election.  im writting this letter to you so you consider changing to election by popular vote for the prsident of the united states instead of electoral college. i belive like branford plumer, that the electoral college is very wrong not only because under the electoral college system, voters dont vote for the president but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president. but also because it is very unfair to voters, candidates dont spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the \"swing\" states.  Electoral College has been around for centuries, but now people feel as if the way presidents are being chose to run our country is unfair. The Electoral College is an unfair way of choosing presidents, by it being known as a winner-take-all system. Stated in the passage, \"Candidates don't spend time in the states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the swing states.\" The candidates in the \"lame\" states did not even see a single campaign ad. The swing states have a higher chance and more likely to see their campaign ads, because they are the more popular states. The more popular states are \"the most thoughtful votes, and should be the ones to decided the election.\" Swing states get campaign ads, they are the ones who are being favored, while there are other states just trying to get a campaign sign, and get their votes recognized.  Presidential candidates focus their attention to swing states, in order to win their electoral votes. Candidates have little to no need to campaign in states that have a majority of one party, because their vote is either a lost cause or all but garunteed. If this system does not do the job that it was originally intended for, then why do we continue to use it?  Furthermore, advocates of the Electoral College make a major fallacy when they claim that voters in swing states are more informed on election information, therefore it's good that the electoral system causes candidates to only focus on them.  In \"Source 2: The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong\", author Bradford Plumer claims \"the electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational\" because \"candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning.\" This means that the candidates focus on the \"tight races of the 'swing' states.\" To continue, Plumer also argues that changing to election by popular vote makes every vote count  But some people don't really know what they are voting for in election which is why the Electoral College is the way to go. Also people complained with the \"winners take all method\" some candidates don't go to certain states and only focus on the swing states. In the 2000 campaign seventeen out of fifty states didn't see the candidates. But the candidates didn't go to those states since they knew they had no chance of winning those states and they needed to focus on the swing states to make sure they win the election. Many people do call the Electoral College an anachronism, but it doesn't need to stick in the past, it needs to be kept in the present and in the future.  In conclusion, we have established our opinion on why the vote should be changed into a popular vote instead of the Electoral College due to a myriad of concepts, such as the disaster factor in 2000, why swing-states are unfair, the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote, just to reveal the tip of the iceberg in our arguments of understanding why the Electoral College is biased, irrational, and unfair. We have also covered the counterclaims and reasoned them with logic, reality, and true rationality of why the Electoral College shoud be abolished in the vote of the President of the United States of America. So, ask yourself as a state senator, who is truly in the hands of the final say for the President? ",

When you have more points of view, you can see your topic from another persons eyes. Having more eyes can help you see if your decision is going to benefit you and others or not. Having a different point of view can also help you narrow down. Narrowing down your options can help you very much and make it easier to choose the right one. When you have more points of view, you can easily choose the right one with others help. Having more points of view can help people in various different ways.  When a person asks for advice it is most likely they're in a situation that is to confusing or difficult to the point where they don't know what the right solution or choice is. Making choices in life can be hard. Most times they'res never a right choice, but having different people to talk to help you find the best decision.  Children were told sometime in their life that everybody was unique and\u00a0different\u00a0in some sort of way, that there were absolutely no two people that looks the same, much less\u00a0think and act the same. This applies in everyday life from then and getting advice is not the exception. Everybody has different beliefs, experience and ways to do things so it's hard to find one person that exactly understand you to the point of giving you advice perfectly.  when you ask people to assist you on a tough choice your going to have to make you will most likely end up making the right choice.  When you are provided with more than one or two opinions it leads you to being able to decifer the right from wrong and what your next move is.  when people ask for advice, talking to more than one person can help you make the better choice. You can learn how to make the better choice most suitable for yourself when you talk to people who may have more experience and wisdom than you, and more people will be able to give their own ideas and inputs into the situation to help you look at the decision to be made in many different ways and perspectives. Finally, asking many people what they would do in the same scenario tells you if there might be a clear majority leaning towards one choice. Having a clear majority lets you know that this is what most people would do in the same situation, which leads you to feeling more comfortable and confident after making that decision. Though many people have to make difficult decisions throughout their lives, asking more people for advice in this decision will lead them into making the right one for themselves.  The reason it would be easier is that the people you ask, have probably been in the same situation you are in. It is also a quicker process because other people can help you through it instead of going in alone. This is really helpful for most people because some situations are nearly impossible to do alone. It takes nearly twice as long if you were to figure out a solution on your own.  there is also plenty of time for sightseeing and other things once you arrive at your destination.  Whether it's a sport, musical instrument, or anything else, events within that activity are often scheduled last minute or without the student knowing days ahead of time. When this happens, they may not have transportation to the location if it is not held at the same school. In this scenario, students should be able to contact a parent or friend who can drive them to wherever they need to be. ",

For example, when you are driving down a busy road or highway you see people throwing bags, cigarette buds, and even clothes out windows of their cars, not worrying about were they end up, in sewers, on the sides of roads, even inside animals. There are some types of community service that actually pick up all this trash around a city. This is important because it teaches character and it makes the city look better and more professional. Another example is that it community service could help other people in the community. There are elder homes where people drop off their elders that can't take care of themselves and people take care of them there. Some workers use this for community service or that is even their job. It can help you in the future to teach you how to take care of elderly people and it even help the community so the people that work out in the city don't get slowed down by having to take care of them. It could also make the elders feel wanted and feel comfortable in a new home. This is why our principal should require community service.  The student would not want to spend their summer doing a boring project because that would mean that they would put it off until the end of summer or they might just not do it at all. Having a project that makes them go outside and explore the world is very interesting and would make anyone want to do it. Students need motivation and having the project be something fun like go to an amusement park and explain what your see. If a teacher really wants a student to spend their summer doing a project, there has to be a motivation factor or something that makes them want to complete the project.  When you get stuck on something whether or not it is to buy a cat or buy a dog. You always ask someone their opinion right? If you don't, you really should it can help you make great decisions like, whether or not should you buy that cat or chose that job.  It's all in your control. Depending on what the choice is, it may effect people's daily lifes (in a positive way).` What people do like is changes that benefit them. The choice you made could change the routine of the person's daily life, they may have less to do on their time or maybe something that they are offered that could be nice. There is usually emergencies where someone need help from a fire or a robber, but you could prevent the disaster from happening. Finally, all of this makes you look like a caring human being. All humans would be grateful for the time that you have sacrificed for a beneficial choice to all, because you asked for multiple opinions, and you understood. This has all happened because you cared for others opinions.  It allows you to travel places you have not seen before and experienece new things.  Talking to multiple people can make you think of new ideas on what to do. If you are really not sure about a decision, people can show you many paths of which you can go down. Having another option can make your decision even more clear. For example, if you're deciding over going to Greece or Italy for your vacation, and other people you talk to are mentioning Paris, you might consider going to Paris instead which you haven't even thought of in the first place.   Learning new things or improving your skills can impress your friends and family, and can sometimes earn you money. For example, if you improve in art or sewing, you would be able to sell it for a bit of money depending on how skilled you are, maybe $20-$30, or if you're good at cooking/ baking, you could sell it at a bake sale or maybe just give it to your friends or family to enjoy as a treat. Learning new things and improving skills can be fun, but sometimes it can take time and effort to put into learning new things and improving, so you have to be willing to take time into that and do your best because it's worth it in the end.  Critics would argue that if students get home schooled they wouldn't get to go out explore the real world. Also, they would fear to talk to people they don't know and only talk to people they do know and that would affect the way the interact with others and could effect the way they attend colleges\u00a0or interviews for jobs or colleges ",

This can be the case for school councelors and the children they are meeting with. FACS may be able to help.  Take for example the many young students who have died while driving because they were texting. Looking around while driving, you can see people distracted by their cell phones. These people are not only teenagers but also adults. The shocking truth is that texting while driving increases the chances of crashing by over 23 times normal driving. People have a longer response time when they text. Then the passengers may not be looking at the road because they may be on their phones. On average, an accident happens within two to three seconds when the driver is texting. So if you do get into an accident you could do major damages to another person car or worse you could cause severe health damage to the other person that was in the other vehicle. Using a cell phone while driving caused an estimated 1.5 million car accidents in the U.S. in 2018 according to the National Safety Council. The U.S. Department of Transportation reported that cell phone use while driving kills 3-000 to 6,000 people every year including the other that got was in the accident because of the bad driver.  If there is an error or flaw in your idea, they can point it out so your idea won't contain that flaw anymore. An example is the Apple Company that makes a variety of electronics that people. They don't have just one version of the idea that they made; they have many different types of phones, each coming from different years with different ideas of the ideal iPhone that everyone would like to buy. People give their ideas to the Apple Company, such as having a phone with no home button, having a bigger-sized phone, or even having a brand new product, like AirPods. Many people who ask one person think it can be embarrassing to ask someone if there is anything wrong just to find out there is something wrong, although it doesn't matter if you get embarrassed or not. It matters that you got the mistake from someone and corrected that mistake for the better of the people. In fact, having more problems is better than having none, because that just means you just have some more to work on, and if the first type of your idea doesn't work out, you can always try again and again with your idea until it has reached the best outcome it can possibly receive.  Just think about it, if students aren't able to use their phones in school at all then they will use it no matter what the case is because they feel the urge to do it. They will feel the need to do it because either they receive text that will make them want to reply back or they become so obsessed with using them that they think that they have to use it.  You would imagine that being on a phone call would be top 3 or 5, but it's not that commun seeing people on a phone call. One of the main reasons it's obviously texting. Another big reason is facebook, snapchat, any social media. A big reason is the camera, women just be taking pictures or videos of themselves, while on the other side guys have the trend to speed, or drive recklessly and record it to show it off. You also have people who find it entertaining to shop online or be reading the news as well as checking the weather. When people are really bored while driving or get stuck in traffic for a long period of time they are also watching videos or even movies.  In conclusion, it's hard to imagine why anyone would think using a phone while driving is a good idea. Nothing good can come from texting or talking on the phone behind the wheel. The best decision anyone can make is to completely forget about their phones while driving and focus on the road. You risk so many things by using your phone while operating a vehicle.. You risk your life, your friends life, strangers lives, and even the money in your pocket. The only exception to being on a phone while driving should be to report an emergency. Otherwise, the use of a cell phone is risky and should be completely banned all over the world. Statistics alone should be enough to open people's eyes to the dangers of using their phone in the car. Phones are distracting and without a doubt should not be used while operating a vehicle.  Many cannot focus fully on the road and the other vehicles, if one keeps talking on phone consistently while driving. This is what leads to fatal accidents. People may think they can multitask while conducting a vehicle and using their cellular devices but in reality that is not the case. Studies show that no matter how concentrated you may think you are, you cause an accident. Whether it's you hitting something small, making others get into an accident, or yourself hitting another car.  as you now have access to all the video games, TV and any other form of entertainment. It also means you are not under any teacher supervision which allows you to daze off and easily be distracted by pets or younger siblings. Especially\u00a0in our day and age where we have cell phones, you would always be able to go on your phone whenever you'd like consequently missing what little important information your being taught. Another important factor ,that most people don't even think about, is the fact that you lose all the connections with your fellow classmates who can be valuable sources of information.  Driving while operating your phone can end in a very horrific way and has for a number of young adults. The number one killer of young adults is motor vehicle crashes. This is a major issue in the United States and it is shown because a law was made to prevent operating a phone and driving. For example, there are billboards everywhere saying no texting and driving and commercials saying the same. Texting and driving may seem tempting to do, but every year thousands of drivers and passengers are killed due to someone being on their phone and driving. It only takes a couple of seconds for you to take your eyes off the road and someone can swerve in your lane or you swerve in someone else's lane and didn't notice because you are texting someone back or looking at a notification.  The cell phone has become so much of a distraction to the point where people are immune to picking up their phone every time they receive a notification. ",

This wouldn't only make the amount of work done plummet, but also the quality of the work. If a kid is performing community service and is really enjoying himself, he is much more likely going to get a lot done and it is going to be very good quality work.   Many people may think that community service is hard work and kids our age shouldn't be doing this, they should be in school learning for a better education.  Well to start off, i think kids should do community service is because all kids do when they get home from school is watch television and play video games  Community service will help students to know what is going on in their town. By helping out a less fortunate family will let a student know that there are people in town that need help. And that there are little things that we can do to help them. Also, if a student is tutoring a child, they will learn that there are kids that may need a little more help then he or she might need. And that tutoring them can help make a very big difference.   I think our school should keep performing community an service, because it's a fun and good task, and most kids at different schools don't get the opportunity to experience community and service day.  They know they have helped the community and this gives them a sense of accomplishment. If community service was required in school, students that did community service by choice anyway will not feel accomplished after doing community service if they had to do it. This takes away the feeling of accomplishment, and discourages students that used to do community service to do community service by choice anymore. Then all students will probably only do the bare minimum and it will not be helping the community since barely any people will do community service.  I think you should require community service to every kid in the school, Because we would be helping the environment and making our community a better place to live in.   All students shouldn't to be require to do community service , only the people that need it. Its just a waste of time in a kids life , even though they know that they are doing something good in this world by helping others.  Therefore community service should be recommended to students, not required because when people serve they should do it willingly, and if they don't they won't have a good attitude about it. Teenagers have a mind of their own so being told what to do bothers them to the point of them never doing it again, and some peoples life may be full of various activities already so they simply don't have the time for it.  It teaches how to clean up after yourself and after others, how NOT to litter, and respect towards others. If we do not learn this earlier in life we won't have the knowledge and care to do it later in life. Teaching this lesson about community service to children could cause a chain reaction. They could teach their friends the lesson, and they could even teach their children in the future. ",
