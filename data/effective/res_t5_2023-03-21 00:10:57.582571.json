                "content": "When a person asks for advice it is most likely they're in a situation that is to confusing or difficult to the point where they don't know what the right solution or choice is. Making choices in life can be hard. Most times they'res never a right choice, but having different people to talk to help you find the best decision.  Have you ever had to make an important life decision? It can be very difficult, depending on the impact of your decision, to choose right away. As a result, you might ask your peers to give you advice to make the right choice. You may find that you agree with some people and disagree with others. Other times you might have to meet in the middle and find pros and cons about everyone's opinion and then make a decision with that information.  Making a decision is extremely difficult and stressful, but asking others for input and advice on the issue can help you make the right choice because it widens your mindset, you end up having more than one solution and more than one perspective on the topic, and you learn from others past and gain information and knowledge from it. You don't want to be in the position where you ask only one person for their advice and listen to them, only to realize they really didn't know what they were saying. The one guranteed way to prevent that from happening is by getting multiple peoples opinions. Now, next time you are faced with a huge choice to make, I hope you ask more than one person about what they think you should do.\u00a0  making a choice is difficult than it already is, and making the best choice does not seem like it is any more luxurious. Some people might be able to decisions\u00a0at the speed of light without getting any opinions, while others might need some more opinions in order to make their decision. Life is all about making choices everyday and people have to accept the results that come out of it. Some people might be more carefree about it, while others might need to think more before they make a choice. Wanting to make the best choice is not selfish at all and is just a part of life. Wanting the credibility, different ideas and views from people is just another way of making the best choice. Therefore, seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice because of credibility, people have different ideas, and people have different views.  When people face difficult decisions and they a few choices they often try to come up with their own reasons as to why they should choose any one choice. Unfortunately, people, like myself, aren't the greatest at coming up with their own reasons. So, when you ask multiple people their opinions, you can base your choice on more than just your own, most likely self-centered, reasons. But, if you only ask one person then you're only going to get a few reasons that are based on one opinion and when you can't come up with reasons yourself a few reasons and one opinion isn't helpful.  Getting other people's input on a choice is important because if you're really split on a decision, the people you seek advice from might make the choice a lot more clear. If you really trust the people you seek advice from, then your choice should be made easily. There's nothing wrong with seeking advice from others sometimes. Sometimes making choices on your own can be very difficult and all it takes is other peoples' different opinions and point of views. You might just need to hear that advice that pushes you into the right direction.  People ask for advice, because sometimes they can't make the choice on their own. It's also not a bad thing to do when you are stuck and need some advice from other people. When people make choices on their own and don't ask anyone for help, they tend to make a bad decision. Some people feel trapped when trying to ask someone they trust for advice, because they are scared about how they are going to react. So then they don't ask them and then the problem they were trying to solve turns into a even bigger problem then before. Then at the last moment they decide to tell or ask the person for advice when it's already too late. Sometimes it can create another problem that they are going to have to solve, or it solves the problem  These are the reasons I believe that asking multiple people for advice can really help you make decisions. Choices in general are very hard to make, especially if you're an indecisive person like I am, so asking other people for help is something I do often. I've received plenty of good advice from when I've had issues with my family or other friends, and with the advice I was given, I was able to make the best choice I could. Even if someone else's opinion is unwanted at the time, later on you can really think about what that person said, and you can choose what to do. I believe that a lot of the good choices I've made in my life are all thanks to my friends, who help me out. Through them and others, I will continue to take advice and make the best choices.  Making a choice on impulse will rarely turn out well as you probably have very little knowledge and advice from others going behind it. It is when you step back and get advice from others that you prevent yourself from making these kinds of decisions. As an example, think about leaders in government. Often times they take a long time to make a decision as they hear from all of their advisers\u00a0and take their time, as they do not want to make a impulsive choice. By forcing yourself to slow down and get advice form others, you are making better choices by having other's advice and making yourself think a little harder about what choice you are going to make. Getting advice does more than just slowing you down to make a better choice, it also allows others to make sure you are making one that will have serious consequences.  when people ask for advice, talking to more than one person can help you make the better choice. You can learn how to make the better choice most suitable for yourself when you talk to people who may have more experience and wisdom than you, and more people will be able to give their own ideas and inputs into the situation to help you look at the decision to be made in many different ways and perspectives. Finally, asking many people what they would do in the same scenario tells you if there might be a clear majority leaning towards one choice. Having a clear majority lets you know that this is what most people would do in the same situation, which leads you to feeling more comfortable and confident after making that decision. Though many people have to make difficult decisions throughout their lives, asking more people for advice in this decision will lead them into making the right one for themselves. ",

Doing this can also help people make decisions easier, and can help many people think clearer when making decisions. As a result, they will always figure out which choice is best for them.\u00a0 \u00a0   \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0   \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice because they can listen to others' point of view, get help from trained professionals, and can be given the opportunity to have a successful future. People should take initiative to ask for help and shouldn't rely on only one person's opinion.\u00a0  One way seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice is that by asking more than one person, they can get more input.  I believe that seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice. This is because others could share the information and experiences that they have had or been through. They can also make sure that the information they have is accurate. Everyone's opinions could create a choice that is less-biased. By compiling what everyone shares, others will have the necessary experiences and the accurate research to make the best unbiased decision.  Seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice. Working together to make decisions has helped not only push humanity through brick walls, but find a better way around them to avoid the disaster. The entire government of the United States of America is based on this belief of multiple opinions being the correct way to solve a problem  The first reason I think seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice is that one person could know more about the situation than others.  seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice. There are many different opinions out there. People look at things differently and have different beliefs, and everybody doesn't have the same experiences. Even on just little things like retaking a test or figuring out your courses for the upcoming year. Listening to other peoples opinions will always help you form the best one.\u00a0  A final way seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice is by being more prepared about the choice they're going to make.  seeking multiple opinions on an issue can help you find the best choice in someones situation. It can confirm the best option or even help rule out the bad ones. Any way you put it, asking multiple people's opinions is way more likely to help someone make a better choice than just one person's opinion.  The next reason I think seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice is someone you ask could have gone through something similar and know what to do about the situation ",

By having one extracurricular activity, students will have a great way of learning new things  Summer is fun and special to so many students who currently go to school. School work is dreadful to many, but designing projects does not sound too bad. Designing projects can be fun and a new experience for many. New ways to learn instead of the old traditional boring way can be interesting. Giving students a little freedom would not hurt. Students should be able to decide what they want to do with these projects as it is a great chance for students to discover many new things.  There are many ways to learn new things, through experience, being taught, and a multitude of other ways to obtain new information. School is the perfect place to learn new things from teachers that have extensive experience in their specific area of expertise. It is the teacher's and administration's job to help provide a well-rounded education for their students and part of that is assigning work that the students do not want to do. Summer projects are important so the students continue to use their brain and learn how to retain information.  Learning new things or improving your skills can impress your friends and family, and can sometimes earn you money. For example, if you improve in art or sewing, you would be able to sell it for a bit of money depending on how skilled you are, maybe $20-$30, or if you're good at cooking/ baking, you could sell it at a bake sale or maybe just give it to your friends or family to enjoy as a treat. Learning new things and improving skills can be fun, but sometimes it can take time and effort to put into learning new things and improving, so you have to be willing to take time into that and do your best because it's worth it in the end.  Students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity because it is very helpful for them. Students get to learn many new things and this might even help them chose their future career. Learning new things can be very tiring to some students and they might not even be able to handle so much information, so by joining a extracurricular activity students will get to have a break from school. To add on, students will will have the chance to socialize and make more friends. Learning can be very difficult for some students, but by participating in at least one extracurricular activity, students will be able to enjoy learning new things, get a break from learning all day, and will get to socialize and make more friends. Therefore students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity because this activity will help them with their school life and their grades.  In the world of education, there have been many arguments about which way of learning could benefit the most people. Some agree that the system we have now is the pinnacle of what we can do to help younger generations learn. However, there is definitely more we could do so the next firemen or police officers in line don't make the same mistakes we have. One of these things is autonomy, the chance to build a new road for one's self. Who wouldn't love the true freedom to become anything by just working to improve skills? One of these bits of autonomy is the chance to try distance learning.  If a student were to designed the project they could choose a topic they were genuinely interested in. This would set them up for success and they could have fun learning something new.  Next, do you the saying \"you learn something new everyday.\" Well its true with community service you can learn things you never knew before.  If students have the ability to design their own project they would be choosing what they have to do the research on. This would increase learning because it would interest an individual student and make them want to gain more knowledge about a specific topic. Another way learning opportunities are increased because after the completion of this project, teachers could asses the student on proving that they actually learned over the break. This would also benefit the teacher in learning something new. ",

It's always important to ask for assistance and feedback when you need it. Because receiving that constructive criticism and working with it reassures the outcome is successful and applies to a larger audience. Overall, asking peers for their opinions can be an eye opener, and refresh one's mind in order to get their point across a variety of people. The more feedback one receives, the stronger the outcome becomes.\u00a0  and it is also very helpful to the environment around you.  Specifically, it is more beneficial when you ask others who have dealt with similar experiences for help. When we do this, we find ourselves relating to others and taking their advice into greater consideration. Through this method, we gain knowledge on possible outcomes for our conflict and how it can be resolved. While filtering our own bias with this new information, we can formulate possible solutions for ourselves. This is an intriguing way that we can all solve our problems because we can use the experiences of others to better our own. Using the lessons learned by others to prevent yourself from carrying the same misfortunes is a key way to avoid conflict. This strategy allows yourself to feel more comfortable about handling the problem because you know someone who has dealt with the same thing. No matter how complex a problem can be, empathy from another who can relate will make the situation better.  In conclusion, making the right decision is crucial for many aspects in life. Some of these aspects include happiness and success. In order to do that, advice from multiple people is needed. Advice is always beneficial from everyone when it comes to making the right choice. In some situations, advice can be more crucial than others but it is needed in all types of problems. It can be from friends, family, or anyone who could help give reputable advice. When multiple people put forth opinions, new perspectives are provided, decisions are rethought, and new ideas are formed.  Specially to those who have learning disabilities. Teachers work at the same pace with every\u00a0student. Which isn't helpful for students as their minds work differently and their comprehension levels vary. Some students learn slower than others and most teachers don't recognize that. With distance learning each student can learn at the pace that is appropriate\u00a0for them. Distance learning is also very helpful as the teacher's focus shifts to each individual student rather than the class as a whole. Online conferencing allows the teacher to understand the student more and asses their abilities. This helps teachers divide students based on what learning techniques is appropriate for them. Which can result in increased student performance.  can even help you decide for yourself.  Also, a further benefit of asking for outside help, is for the well-being of others. If this decision could affect the lives of other individuals, its only common sense to be one hundred and one percent sure before making that decision, and what better way to be one hundred and one percent sure than asking the advice of others.   it can help you in the future, after seeing how the advice works the first time.  If you help a mentally disabled or physically disabled person that is less fortunate than you understand that you have more than you can ask for while some others don't even have a home, a good brain, or even body parts. If you help the needy and you say to your parents this is nice helping others they'll look at you as a more mature adult knowing that now you know not to take anything for granted and enjoy all the little things.

It will make it easier for you because you have friends to be there for you during the stressful times. When I make a hard decision I like to take care of myself. Giving yourself love and care can relive stress too, during hard times. You do not want to have your stress get in the way of your school, or sports. Stress can make you forget about what is important and make you just focus on that one thing. That is why when you ask for help it can also, help relive your stress.   Have you ever had a really important decision you had to make? Did you feel overwhelmed because you didn't know what you should do? Asking for help or advise from people such as friends and family around you can really help alleviate all that stress. Most people encounter big decisions often throughout their lives, so getting advise from numerous people can help you get more input on something, and may end up helping you make a final decision.  The decision maker can use all the advise they've gotten from different people to make their own choice, and feel better prepared. They will be more focused as they know what they want to do, and will feel more confident and less overwhelmed. Feeling less overwhelmed can be a big help as the person doesn't have to be so worried, so they won't have any distractions from making the best possible decision. For example, if someone is trying to decide what kind of car they want to get, and they've gotten advise from numerous people, they can make a better choice when picking. They'll know exactly what they want, as they've heard many thoughts from the people around them, and so they can make their final decision.   Sometimes when a decision is very impactful, you can get stressed out over the choice you want to make. Asking others may make deciding easier because all you have to honestly do is listen to their ideas and decide if you agree with them or not. Then, using your common sense and their advice, you can choose the decision you believe is best for you . Also, you actually might know what you are going to choose. But you might still want to ask other people what they think because that can \"confirm\" that you have made the right decision.   It has been proven that stress only causes harmful and emotional side effects to individuals. So, why not remove it? That is exactly why simple checks on your work, or something you may be unsure about can make a real impact. As stressful as everyday human lives can be, there's no harm done in taking a little out of your time to ask others about your situation and how to deal with it. Being more sure on something can cause an individual to worry less and end up making better decisions. Maybe you have a huge decision coming up like a proposal. You need to be absolutely sure and know it in your gut that this is the right decision to be made, and asking others can help you know that you are making the right decision or you are making the wrong decision  Listening to multiple options, knowing the pros and cons of each side, and relieving decision-making stress are all reasons why you should ask more than one person for advice. You always want to make the right choice, especially for bigger decisions like buying a house. Getting to know all your options and the pros and cons of each is very important for making the best choice for you. However, this could be very stressful and asking all your friends for advice will make sure you feel supported and less stressed.  Making a decision is extremely difficult and stressful, but asking others for input and advice on the issue can help you make the right choice because it widens your mindset, you end up having more than one solution and more than one perspective on the topic, and you learn from others past and gain information and knowledge from it.

They go back and forth between all the choices that they could possibly make, and all it does is make them anxious. I know this from personal experience because I'm a very indecisive person, and making big decisions stress me out a lot. But when I have the opinions of multiple people to help me, it makes the decision process so much easier. They all tell me their input and what they would do, and it calms me down and helps me think through it clearer.  When a student is pushed a little to do better they react accordingly but, when they are pushed to across their limit they tend to feel overwhelmed and agitated  Whenever I have to make an important\u00a0decision, I often become\u00a0agitated\u00a0and start doubting myself, listing reasons why I wasn't correct. Versus when advice is given from a unbiased outsider's point of view, it is often more rational and factual, rather than emotional. Yesterday, when my homework folder mysteriously disappeared, hearing my friends explain what they would do made me realize my problem wasn't as extreme as I made it out to be. The advice given to you can strengthen your decision by explaining why your choice is stronger, while adding points to why other options are weaker.

People look at things differently and have different beliefs, and everybody doesn't have the same experiences. Even on just little things like retaking a test or figuring out your courses for the upcoming year. Listening to other peoples opinions will always help you form the best one.\u00a0  Everyone has their own personal opinion, hearing multiple opinions from many different people can be great advice and something\u00a0you can learn from when making a decision or choice. For example if someone had a bad experience at a restaurant their opinion on the restaurant is going to be way different than someone who had an amazing experience at that restaurant. There is no such thing as a right or wrong opinion, but you can always learn from what others have to say  Different people will have different ideas and options from their perspectives on different kinds of things. It is best to decide whether or not they have the same opinions or ideas, to see if they could bond to make new decisions. Everyone that that person picks from to get advice, could have the same opinions as others or different. Depending on people you trust may have better opinions then those of the people you do not trust. This person might think that the people they do care about or know more, have more ideas to pick from and approve from because they know and trust them most.  Having many peoples' opinions presents you with different people giving their own taste at what they like and don't like with the idea you have.  When receiving advice, the response you get will be different from everyone. This is because everyone views things from a different standpoint. Some people think it's best to keep their not so positive opinions to themselves, while other are going to share everything with you. It's important to have both these kinds of people in your life, because they're both needed in different situations. Let's say, for instance, you get a new shirt that you absolutely love. You probably want to hear from your peers that it looks great on you. Now, let's say you are shopping and find shoes that you aren't too sure about. In this situation, you're probably wanting to hear from your more honest friend, who will truthfully tell you how they look  This happens because everyone has a different variety of viewpoints, even if they are the same, they might see it a different\u00a0way or have different facts backing it up. This helps you when you need advice, by letting you have the full view of the opinion and limiting the bias by using other people accounts\u00a0to find the inconsistencies. When you do this it is much better than just having one opinion because that person might be biased towards one side and then by consequence your opinion will become biased.  Throughout peoples lives, everyone has had different experiences that shaped who they are today and the choices the make. Every single decision that people make is in someway decided by there past experiences, because those experiences are what led them to an understanding of right and wrong. This leads to people having differing opinions on topics. Talking to these people is crucial because it can allow people to see both sides of the situation, and the reasons that lead them to their decision. When those reasons are taken into account a balanced conclusion can be achieved, despite the differing opinions.  There is always more than one side to every story. Seeing more than one point of view at a situation can help advise you toward making the best decision. One persons point of view may be way different from an others, meaning they may have had a totally different experience, and/or have many different opinions than another person   When people ask for advice, they should always seek more than one opinion because the people they ask could have different past experience, be biased, or have different opinions about the matter. When asking for an opinion in something, always ask different people and different kinds of people. People can have different opinions about things and be biased. Asking biased people for an opinion on something is never good so that is why people ask more than one individual before they make an important choice. In conclusion, this is why people need to get multiple opinions before they make a big choice.  All people will most certainly not have the same ideas, so you can see what other people have to say about things. You might be sided with one persons idea, then after being able to view other peoples idea, you might shift your viewpoints. This can be a good thing because you might not always have the best, or even the right idea for yourself. Viewing other peoples ideas and thinking about them can cause you to think about more than just one idea, so you can make the best out of others ideas. This can help you make good choices because it allows you to see multiple angles, not just one. ",

For example, when people go to jail, they regret their descision they made because it changed their life in a horrible way. Other peoples opinions can lead you into a bad direction, if you dont think about the possible outcomes. There can be some bad outcomes when you listen to peoples opinions, but if you chose carefully and follow the correct steps it will not be so bad. If someone is per-persuring you, that is never the right way to listen someones advice because they are forcing you. Always listen to yourself when someone is forcing you and not always be a follower, but also listen to other opinons when they are not forcing you.  As all evidence suggests, taking advice from multiple people is the right course of action to receive the best information. When people only take advice from one person, they allow for many mistakes and mishaps. Next time you are trying to make a decision that will have the best outcome, rather than only asking for advice from one person, take advice from multiple and gather as much information about the topic as possible. The more information you have, the more likely you are to make the correct choice.  People depend on other's gratification and it feels great when someone likes the outcome of a decision. In order for this to happen, one should ask multiple people for advice and shouldn't only take their's. When I take my own advice, it is often biased towards what I want, and I don't necessarily see all points of view of the decision I have to make. Taking my own advice is beneficial in situations where common sense is used and in situations where I have no one to to ask, such as logical situations or doing school work.   When you know several opinions, you have a better understanding of how others feel about the issue and can reach a general consensus, what the majority of people think, about the topic that you are deciding upon, which can make the correct advice easier to find. By seeking multiple opinions, you can find which ones are poor choices and which ones are ingenious ideas and doing this can make finding correct advice easier. If you seek multiple opinions, you may find out that others have had to make the same decision and had a positive outcome who'se decision you may want to follow. You also may find people who have made bad choices that you would not want to follow. By doing these three things, you increase your chances of finding correct information in the advice that others give you. If you get correct advice by asking multiple people, or if you don't ask anyone and make the wrong choice, you would be on trend mathematically with how many people you talk to, and your result.  Crucial aspects of making a good choice are avoiding bias, seeing the decision through other people's perspective, and considering all options. Seeking advice from multiple people leads to all of this, making asking people for advice an important task to do when faced with a choice to make. Avoiding bias aids in making a decision to which the outcome is beneficial to all concerned. New perspectives helps to consider how everyone feels about a choice. Finally, considering all options and outcomes makes for an easier time deciding which choice is better overall. Even when making petty choices that most people make each day, such as choosing what to eat and what to wear, people may benefit from a bit of advice. The world would be a wonderful place if everyone asks someone for advice before doing something that could change the course of events. Choices wouldn't be irrational, and petty fights wouldn't break out and start arguments or wars. All it takes to make a good decision and to be satisfied by the outcome is to talk to people and ask for their opinion. What is so difficult about this?  By getting advice from others, you can make good decisions, as people can give you insights into your problem and help you to make the best choice. When you simply get advice from others, your ability to make the right decision is greatly increased, as you can find more options, understand the problem better, discover some of the repercussions your decision may have, and find out what others think the best action for you to take is. By discovering all of this, you can make an informed decision based on it, which will almost always be better than an impulsive decision that could have serious consequences. Getting advice from others will always be helpful in making the right choices.  Listening to another person's opinions can open your mind to the different ways of doing something. It can also help some people to grow as a person and be able to take their own advice.  In order to get the most well rounded advice a person must ask a variety of different people. Often times someone will only ask one person for advice, making their point of view limited. They are only getting one opinion, and aren't able to see how other people interpret what they want to know.  As a result of us collectively having different experiences in life, we get to provide one another with new thoughts and ideas through giving advice. The process of seeking multiple opinions can provide you with a guaranteed and better outcome for handling a pressing conflict. You can also recognize the many ways one can look at the situation. As well as, recognize the results from of others when they went through the same occurrence, and the multiple ways you can resolve the situation. Having a myopic mind can be a true curse, and taking advice from others prohibits yourself from making consequential mistakes because of being blinded by bias. Talking to others who have dealt with the similar problem allows you to feel more comfortable in your situation, and gain some peace in being to relate to another. Having others provide with different ways they would resolve the situation allows you to consider the many options and pick the best one for your situation.
