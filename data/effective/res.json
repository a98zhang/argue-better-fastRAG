Eventually, she became one of the most influential activists ever to exist. She is able to address\u00a0important topics, such as women's rights, in ways that she never could before. Through proper preparation, her weak public speaking turned into her greatest strength. This proves that goals are met when students can connect with their mentors. Students must be given the chance to build a relationship with their teachers. If summer projects are teacher-designed, this will allow students to email their teachers with questions about the assignments.

For this reason, in the following discussion, the word \"state\" also refers to the district of columbia. Next, each canidate running for president in your state has his or her own group of electors.  The electors are generally chosen by the candidate's political party,but state laws vary on how the electors are selected and what their responsibilities are.  The president election is held every four years on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. Also, most states have a \"winner-take-all\" system that awards all electors to the winning presidential canidate . However, Maine and Nebraska each have a variation of \"proportion representation\".  Abolishing the electoral college! But don't worry they're not alone; according to a Gallup poll in 2000, taken shortly after Al Gore.  Thanks to the quirks of the electoral college, which won the popular vote but lost the presidency, over 60 percent of voterswould prefer a direct election to the kind we have now.  Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president.  You might not know this so if you dont here is something very interesting for you to know. Who are the electors? Well they can be snoyone not holding public office. Here's something eles you might know, Who picks the electors in the first place? well here's the answer it depends on the state. The single best argument against the electoral college is what we might call the disaster factor.  The American people should consider themselces lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century; the system allows for must more. consider that state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors, and thats those electors could always defy the will of the people.

The first thing they do is rush the task to get it over with, and the second thing they do is push it off as much as they can. Similarly, when a student is given an assignment that is not of interest to them, the quality of work is very low. In reference to the summer, this general idea is heightened; a majority of students tend to push off assignments to the very latest, creating lackluster work and also not learning much from the assignment. Personally, I have experienced this repeatedly. When I was given a summer assignment for my English class this year, I was eager to read the book. While, the book was interesting the assignment was extremely long. The intended goal of the assignment was to expand the knowledge and analysis of the book, but after completing the assignment, I felt like that once held excitement and knowledge was gone. If I had the ability to design my own assignment relating to the book, I most likely would have enjoyed completing the assignment, allowing for an expansion of knowledge. This does not only apply to my experiences with summer assignments, but also applies to my overall experience as a student. When given the liberty to decide my own work, I am not only excited to work, but I am also more dedicated. When my education is in my hands, I produce some of my best work. Currently as a junior enlisted in a self led research class, I have learned so much about myself and the overall topic I am researching. Although at first the task at hand was daunting, I learned how to organize myself effectively and complete a thorough research project that I am happy with. By having the research project on my own, I am constantly thinking about it and I spend more time to work. Giving students the ability to decide their course of work is one of the most beneficial decisions a teacher can make for the future of a student. ",

Why is it necessary for a program to constantly scan our face just to see if we like something or not? This gives the computer so much power of constantly knowing what your exact emotions are on everything. It is just so unnecessary that it causes one to question why in the world would we risk giving computers that kind of power. Also, is it appropiate to constantly scan childrens' faces as they are trying to learn? Would there be a security system in place or parental agreement necessary that would allow the permission of constant invasion of privacy in the name of education? There are many ethical questions and unknown future outlooks that one would not want to subject children to that sort of test of safety and security. ",

The actions taken began to change the thoughts of the citizens and create a petrifying conclusion that the man was not on the run to be everyone's president. This dilema could have been changed around if Romney had shown that he had cared more for his state and his country and thought more about the needs he could fill and the actions he could improve, then many of the voters would have most likely shown repsect and a desire for the man to be choosen as their new president. On the opposing hand Romney had not shown any of those qualities or passion which had caused for him to be thought of as unresponisble and selfish.

In addition this means that each state will receive an opportunity to have a meaningful vote to the elections because every state has the same kinds of members being awareded to them. Each state will have a different number of members due to the size, but they will all be of equal value to the canidates. To add for support, Posner says, \"No region has enough electoral votes to elect a president\"(Posner 1). With this, all the states understand that their vote is crucial to the election and the canidates. Fortunately, the Electoral College is fair and equal to all the state's voting in the election, sometimes even more than some states know. For example, Posner states, \" Voters in toss up states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign-to really listen tp the competing candidates-knowing that they are going to decide the election\"(Posner 1).\u00a0 Ultimately, the Electoral College is the most fair way to decide and vote for a future president who will be our leader of all the citizens.

This line states that the lab partner will be able to tell a difference netween a genuine and meaningful smile from a harshly forced smile. There is a difference between the two because smiling will not make you happy although it is a happy gesture. The machine informing someone that they need to smile will not actually change the emotions of that person. Politicians and celebrities are major culprits of this action. They often smile as they are told to do, but they are not always genuine. They are typically hiding something from their spectators such as when they are not being truthful (D'Alto 8). Just because famous people smile when talking or looking at their audience does not change whether or not they are happy individuals. If humans themselves are unable to change their emotions when they can detect that something is wrong, then machines will be unable to do that also.

For example, when you are happy, muscles in your face move up, and when you are sad, they move down, FACS tracks this and calculates your emotions. The creators of this software, Prof. Thomas Huang and Prof. Nicu Sebe are the leading experts of developing better ways for humans and computers to communicate.

In the novel, \"I Am Malala,\" Malala's father prepares her to be a successful public speaker. At first Malala was not very good at speaking in front of a big audience, but he worked with her everyday to build her knowledge and improve her skills. Eventually, she became one of the most influential activists ever to exist. She is able to address\u00a0important topics, such as women's rights, in ways that she never could before. Through proper preparation, her weak public speaking turned into her greatest strength. This proves that goals are met when students can connect with their mentors. Students must be given the chance to build a relationship with their teachers. If summer projects are teacher-designed, this will allow students to email their teachers with questions about the assignments. This will not only generate a strong relationship, but it will also prepare students for the style of teaching they will soon face at school. ",

Each state will have a different number of members due to the size, but they will all be of equal value to the canidates. To add for support, Posner says, \"No region has enough electoral votes to elect a president\"(Posner 1). With this, all the states understand that their vote is crucial to the election and the canidates. Fortunately, the Electoral College is fair and equal to all the state's voting in the election, sometimes even more than some states know. For example, Posner states, \" Voters in toss up states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign-to really listen tp the competing candidates-knowing that they are going to decide the election\"(Posner 1).\u00a0 Ultimately, the Electoral College is the most fair way to decide and vote for a future president who will be our leader of all the citizens.

For real instance, children or students aren't agree about their parent's thinking, or the education from school completely. Most of them don't say it out, or talk back. It's really affects about effective in studying and their plans in the future. ",

High School and Middle School students tend not to share their emotions, even with their parents.

Once students like these are identified then counselers and social workers could step in, allowing for students to be helped.

If humans were to only hover over Venus, the possibilites are limited. Humans and technology have to be as close as possible. Technology that could last for a few weeks is enough to vastly expand our knowledge. Mechanical computers are now obsolete, but in Venus would be a valuable tool, just like the other electonics being made. Researchers have worked tirelessly to continue making Venus exploration a reasonable reality. ",

One example would be medicine itself. In the 17th century, diseases ran rampant, especially smallpox, as there was no method of combating the virus. Europe had no cure for smallpox, and a large percent of Europe's\u00a0population passed, as well as the American Indians later, who lost 50 to 90 percent of their population due to the disease. Many years of trying to find a cure for this disease failed, even when all of Europe was trying. However, a European came back from Asia (most likely China) with knowledge of inoculation. China and parts of Asia had suffered from the Bubonic Plague, and created inoculation, which today is known as vaccination. One received a small amount of the virus so one's immune system learned to fight it. This method of disease prevention was widely used in England, then in the rest of Europe. Because of the advice from another side of the world and the widespread use of this \"new cure,\" smallpox and other viral infections were eradicated from Europe. ",

These sensors are expecially useful when backing up and driving backwards, as many drivers struggle with getting a full view of what goes on behind them. However, with the LIDAR radar, this problem is eliminated, making backwards driving easier. Putting radar into the drivers seat is not so much about losing the human touch of driving, but getting a more accurate perspective on the road. ",

Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for the slate of electors, who in turn elect the president.  Who picks the electors? It depends on the state. Sometimes state conventions, sometimes the state party's central comittee, sometimes the presidentail canidates themselves. Voters can't controls whom their electors vote for. Well not always .Voters sometimes get very confused about the votes in vote for the wrong canidate.  The best arguement against the electoral college is called Disater Factor. The Americans should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election in a century. Back in 1960, segregations in Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratics with new electors that would oppose John F. Kennedy.  The Electoral College is widely regarded as an anachronism, a non-democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be overruled by declaring the canidates who recieve the most votes. A dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is possible, it happened in 2000, but it's less likely than a dispute over popular vote.  The Electoral College requires a presidential Canidate to have trans-regional appeal. No other region ( South, Northwest, etc.) has enough electoral votes to elect a president. The winner takes all method of awarding electoral votes. The electoral College avoids the problems of elections in which no canidate recieves a majority of the votes cast. For an example, nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992 both had only a 43 percent plurality of the popular votes.       \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ",

        "query": "The founding fathers established it in the Constitution as acompromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by popular vote of quilified citizens. Your state's entitled allotment of electors equals the number of members in its Congressional delegation, one for each member in the House of Representatives plus\u00a0 two for your Senators. The presidential election is held every four years on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. You help choose your state's electors when you vote for your candidate you are actually voting for your candidate's electors. The Certificate of Ascertainment also declares the winning presidential candidate in your state and shows which electors will represent your state at the meeting of the electors in December of the election year. Your state's Certificates of Ascertainments are sent to the Congress and the National Archives as part of the official records of the presidential election. At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winner-take-all system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states the know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on thje tight\u00a0 races in the \"swing\" sates. During the 2000 camaign, seventeen states din't see the candidates at all, inckuding Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters inn 25 of the largest media markets didn't get to see a single campaign ad. If anyone has a good argument for putting the fate of the presidency in the hands of a few swing voters in Ohio, they have yet to make it. The electoral College requires a presindential candidates to have trans-regional appeal. No region (South, Northeast, etc.) has enough electoral votes to elect a president. So a solid regional favorite, such as Rommey was in the South, has no incentive to campaing heavily in those states, for he gains no electoral votes by increasing his plurality in states that he knows he will win. This is a desirable result because a candidate with only regional appeal is unlikely to be a succesful president. The residents of the other regions are likely to feel disenfranchised, to feel that their votes do not count, that the new president will have no regard for their interests, that he really isn't their president.

This will reduce the time the student must spend catching up and encourage the student to stay at home when they are sick. This, in turn, will keep diseases like the flu from spreading rapidly through the school system as fewer students come to class sick. If the lessons are recorded, a student missing school for an event can catch up on classes at times teachers are usually unavailable. Many students choose not to attend academic competitions, extracurricular activities, and other important events during the school day because of the fear of missing class. Recording lectures encourages these students to pursue academic enrichment outside of the classroom as they do not have to worry as much about catching up on classes. They can play back these recordings during times when teachers are not commonly available which decreases the time it takes students to catch up on missed work, thus reducing the stress of missing class.

However, this reasoning is flawed in that it assumes that citizens of a state are more likely to inform theirselves thouroughly simply because their vote holds more value, in a sense. Also, candidates would no longer pay special attention to swing states if the electoral college weren't in place so the votes of these citizens wouldn't be held above the rest.

Not only does it ignore the rights of the people, but this gives an unfair advantage to the candidate who's party is currently in power.  ",

One Friday, the smog of Paris \"rivaled Beijing, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world\". On the following Monday, motorists with even-numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a $31 fine. After only one day with less cars on the roads, the smog had nearly dissappeared. This shows that even a day with less cars can make a huge difference in the amount of air pollution. Rosenthal's article, \" The End of Car Culture\", states that many sociologists believe that if the pattern of less cars continues, \"it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment\" because transortation is America's second largest sourse of carbon emissions. Less air polution is a very important advantage of less cars.  ",

It is obvious that the voters only know so much of what they vote for and do not really get a good taste of how the presidential canadidate is like. It can be clear that as a blind election, the voters have no hints of who they might be voting towards and in the end can cause a major catasrophe if a canadidate has very little intentions for the states. In agreement to the article the text  In the defense of the electoral college by Richard A. Posner it begins to sate the election of Romney who, by increasing his plurality and possesing only regional appeal, lost the peoples desire to vote for him thinking that the man has no regards for their interest and does not have any intentions of improving their needs or helping with creating a community where the people can rely on Romney. The actions taken began to change the thoughts of the citizens and create a petrifying conclusion that the man was not on the run to be everyone's president. This dilema could have been changed around if Romney had shown that he had cared more for his state and his country and thought more about the needs he could fill and the actions he could improve, then many of the voters would have most likely shown repsect and a desire for the man to be choosen as their new president. On the opposing hand Romney had not shown any of those qualities or passion which had caused for him to be thought of as unresponisble and selfish.  The country has more than thousands and thousands of people to serve and direct. It can be understood that having a large amount of citizens can result in uncertainty towards the election and the votes cast, yet it is yet to be changed to a more reasonable way of confronting it. With many systems such as \"Winner-Take -All\" due to states titled as the \"Swing States,\" it can be an untrustworthy election fo rmany voters around the country. The election process not only need to be changed to select a more responsible canadidate, but to create a more trustworthy system of itself.  ",

In addition this means that each state will receive an opportunity to have a meaningful vote to the elections because every state has the same kinds of members being awareded to them. Each state will have a different number of members due to the size, but they will all be of equal value to the canidates. To add for support, Posner says, \"No region has enough electoral votes to elect a president\"(Posner 1). With this, all the states understand that their vote is crucial to the election and the canidates. Fortunately, the Electoral College is fair and equal to all the state's voting in the election, sometimes even more than some states know. For example, Posner states, \" Voters in toss up states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign-to really listen tp the competing candidates-knowing that they are going to decide the election\"(Posner 1).\u00a0 Ultimately, the Electoral College is the most fair way to decide and vote for a future president who will be our leader of all the citizens.

Just as our jet airplanes travel at a higher altitude to fly over many storms, a vehicle hovering over Venus would avoid the unfriendly ground conditions by staying up and out of their way. At thirty-plus miles above the surface, temperatures would still be toasty at around 170 degrees Fahrenheit, but the air pressure would be close to that of sea level on Earth. Solar power would be plentiful, and radiation would not exceed Earth levels. Not easy conditions, but survivable for humans.\" (paragraph 5). NASA has a soultion for the safety issue that was recently brought to their attention. The people who want to go and explore Venus now believe that this is one of the final steps toward actually getting off of the ground. If NASA trains astronauts well enough, tries to simulate the conditions on Venus, and everything works well; there is noting holding them back. ",

It is obvious that the voters only know so much of what they vote for and do not really get a good taste of how the presidential canadidate is like. It can be clear that as a blind election, the voters have no hints of who they might be voting towards and in the end can cause a major catasrophe if a canadidate has very little intentions for the states. In agreement to the article the text  In the defense of the electoral college by Richard A. Posner it begins to sate the election of Romney who, by increasing his plurality and possesing only regional appeal, lost the peoples desire to vote for him thinking that the man has no regards for their interest and does not have any intentions of improving their needs or helping with creating a community where the people can rely on Romney. The actions taken began to change the thoughts of the citizens and create a petrifying conclusion that the man was not on the run to be everyone's president. This dilema could have been changed around if Romney had shown that he had cared more for his state and his country and thought more about the needs he could fill and the actions he could improve, then many of the voters would have most likely shown repsect and a desire for the man to be choosen as their new president. On the opposing hand Romney had not shown any of those qualities or passion which had caused for him to be thought of as unresponisble and selfish.  The country has more than thousands and thousands of people to serve and direct. It can be understood that having a large amount of citizens can result in uncertainty towards the election and the votes cast, yet it is yet to be changed to a more reasonable way of confronting it.

The election process not only need to be changed to select a more responsible canadidate, but to create a more trustworthy system of itself.  ",

If teachers are able to recieve this information, their teaching would become more effective. Teachers could change lesson plans in order to fit the needs of the students, and give extra support and help to those children that are still struggling. FACS can also help excite studnets about learning. This is important because no matter how much a teacher trys to help a student, the studnet will not imporve in anything if thet do not want to learn. If computers are able to read if studnets are excited or bored by a lesson, teachers would add visuals and what not to make it more intersesting to a student.

For example, some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface and have lested about three weeks...These devices were first envisiond in the 1800's and played an important role in the 1940's during the war...but, these devices made calculations by using gears and levers without electricity...By comparison, systems that use mechanical pats can be made more resistant to pressure, heat, and other forces\"(paragraph 7). This means that hypothetically NASA could send older tech and find a way to uncover more information. ",

Personally I always watched others and my own brother do theater for a while, and I finally said to myself in sixth grade to try it out. I had heard of it but never tried it I signed up and 5 months later fell in love. It was one of the most fun things I had ever done! Now this is my last year but if I hadn't tried it who knows where I would be right now. When my best friend\u00a0was nervous about keyboarding club because he thought he couldn't type fast he didn't even want to sign up so I told him that if he doesn't like it he can quit and try something different, and so he tried it and it turned out that he liked it but didn't want to continue, so he quit and tried robotics and then he loved it. He said it was trial and error and thats true. Having to do one club is fine and if while choosing one it doesn't fit you can always try a different one. In the end trying something new can be a challenge but at the end of the day if the end result isn't what you want you can always try something new. ",

There is a difference between the two because smiling will not make you happy although it is a happy gesture. The machine informing someone that they need to smile will not actually change the emotions of that person. Politicians and celebrities are major culprits of this action. They often smile as they are told to do, but they are not always genuine. They are typically hiding something from their spectators such as when they are not being truthful (D'Alto 8). Just because famous people smile when talking or looking at their audience does not change whether or not they are happy individuals. If humans themselves are unable to change their emotions when they can detect that something is wrong, then machines will be unable to do that also.

He describes it as safer, since gear usually ensures that someone will not be exposed to a certain conditon in a inhabitable environment for humans. He further argues that modern computers are more fragile in extreme conditions, and are not as strong as mechanical computers. He strongly supports it by comparing it to other popular technologies, \"...imagine exposing a cell phone or tablet to acid or heat capable of melting tin\" (Paragraph 7). He explains in comparison, that systems using mechanical parts are far more resistant to pressure, heat, and other forces, unlike modern technology.

My family has always been a family who has lived by the bible, to my family that's the greatest advice you can get, even me, so because of that story my mom always told me she has put her life on the bible and now she's a pastor of Generic_City United Methodist Church. I know I'm talking about a lot of Christianity, but because of Christianity, her faith went up, and she used the advice she was given, from her grandmother and the bible, and passed it down onto us. What I'm saying here is, with all the advice that has been given to you, you can use that advice and pass it down to your kids if you have any, then they could pass it on to their kids and it could keep on going throughout the generations. Advice can really go a long way if you get advice that sticks with you your entire life. ",

Although the propaganda is truely just that: propaganda, there is some truth in them, and the voters in bigger states are more well versed in the political and practical advantages of one canidate over the other. Article 3, while defending the Electoral College, in fact condems itself, by saying that voters in so called \"swing states,\" where there is no true dominant party, are likely to be given the most information on the canidates as they battle over who will get that state's votes in the college. The same thing can be said for the bigger states, because neither politician can really afford to let the other gain the upper hand in that state. Therefore smaller states, or states that are basicly marooned on one party are ignored or disregarded as worthless and unattainable in any case, so they widthold information from them, forcing them to vote blindly in favor of whichever party they choose, which votes may be discarded anyway.

According to the Office of the Federal Register, \"The founding fathers established it in the Constitution as a compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens.\" More than anything the electoral college is a mutual and nuetral process that represents something inbetween the biased politics of Congress and the average citizen. The average working class person is the greatest example of American integrity. This person shows that in this great nation, if you set a goal and are willing to work to acheive that goal, it can be acheived. ",

Presidential candidates will not bother campaigning in states that are loyal to their adversary or are too small to be worth their time. While a single person's opinion might not seem important, or rounding votes seems \"easier,\" no corners should ever be cut when deciding who the leader of a nation with over 50 million citizens is, which is why the Electoral College should be replaced by the popular vote system.

Additionally, most candidates only advertise and visit \"swing\" states. \"Swing\" states are the states that usually determine the outcome of the election. \"The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong\" written by Bradford Plumer says, \"During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn't get to see a single campaign ad\". It's unjustifiable that simply because you have fewer electors in your state, you don't get to watch your candidates campaign. As previously mentioned, each state has a different number of electoral votes. It all depends on the population. For example, Texas, with a huge population has 38 electors, while Maine only has 4. The article, \"The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid out defenses of the system are wrong\" states, \"Beacuse each state casts only one vote, the single representative from Wyoming, representing 500,000 voters, would have as much say as the 55 representatives from California, who represent 35 million voters\". Why do some states have more representatives than others just because of their population? It's not fair to the smaller states. It is true that the bigger states have more people in them, needing more representation, however, the smaller states have as much to say as the big ones. ' ",

In this system, the winner of the popular vote in an individual state wins all of the electoral votes a state has. According to the Office of the Federal Register, all but two states use this system. These two states are Nebraska and Maine. As a result of the winner-take-all system, it is possible that a presidential candidate loses the overall popular vote, but wins more electoral votes and thus wins the election. This occurance happened in the infamous 2000 election, when Al Gore won the popular vote but lost to George W. Bush by a mere five electoral votes. If the public indicated they wanted Al Gore as president, why should Bush have won due to this unfair system? It simply doesn't make sense. The winner-take-all system also results in political campaigns to focus their efforts in only certain regions. Some states very predictably vote either for the Republican candidate or for the Democratic candidate. Take Texas, for instance, which has traditionally always voted red. A Democratic candidate knows he should not focus his campaign in Texas, because he realizes his best efforts won't allow him to win the popular vote there and thus win the electoral votes. Because of the tendencies of certain states, many electoral votes are practically predetermined. The states which do not typically only vote in favor of one side are labelled \"swing states\". With the way the Electoral College works, the few states which are a toss-up carry the most weight. Presidential candidates will usually spend most of their time in these swing states, and very little time in others. For example, in the 2000 election, seventeen states were not visited by either candidate. Supporters of the Electoral College view the disproportional focus of campaigns as a positive. According to Richard A. Posner's article in favor of this corrupt system, \"The Electoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment of the Senate decreed in the Constituion...\" (21) ",

That is not fair to other voters who don't vote for the popular candidate in their state; they don't receive any electors. Additionally, most candidates only advertise and visit \"swing\" states. \"Swing\" states are the states that usually determine the outcome of the election. \"The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong\" written by Bradford Plumer says, \"During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn't get to see a single campaign ad\". It's unjustifiable that simply because you have fewer electors in your state, you don't get to watch your candidates campaign. As previously mentioned, each state has a different number of electoral votes. It all depends on the population. For example, Texas, with a huge population has 38 electors, while Maine only has 4. The article, \"The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid out defenses of the system are wrong\" states, \"Beacuse each state casts only one vote, the single representative from Wyoming, representing 500,000 voters, would have as much say as the 55 representatives from California, who represent 35 million voters\". Why do some states have more representatives than others just because of their population? It's not fair to the smaller states. It is true that the bigger states have more people in them, needing more representation, however, the smaller states have as much to say as the big ones. ' ",

The machine informing someone that they need to smile will not actually change the emotions of that person. Politicians and celebrities are major culprits of this action. They often smile as they are told to do, but they are not always genuine. They are typically hiding something from their spectators such as when they are not being truthful (D'Alto 8).

But he has to campaign to other states and regions since he knows the South doesn't have enough power to make him president. And with that comes your swing states and the big states. Swing states listen to what the presidental candidates have to say since they are toss-up states. These swing states literally can \"swing\" the election. These are the states that are going to decide who the next president is. And that ties in with your big states; California, Texas, Florida, New York, and Pennsylvania are some of your big states since they have the most population out of the United States. These states can also be swing states since they have the most votes out of every state. With the power of the popular vote a presidental canidate can become president, and other regions will not have a say. But using the Electoral College that can't happen. ",

This is unfair to people in the Dakotas or Montana have no information to base their votes on, instead just picking a canidate by mainly party affiliation. the biggest political battles are in fact fought over the biggest states, in the forms of advertisements and propaganda. Although the propaganda is truely just that: propaganda, there is some truth in them, and the voters in bigger states are more well versed in the political and practical advantages of one canidate over the other. Article 3, while defending the Electoral College, in fact condems itself, by saying that voters in so called \"swing states,\" where there is no true dominant party, are likely to be given the most information on the canidates as they battle over who will get that state's votes in the college. The same thing can be said for the bigger states, because neither politician can really afford to let the other gain the upper hand in that state. Therefore smaller states, or states that are basicly marooned on one party are ignored or disregarded as worthless and unattainable in any case, so they widthold information from them, forcing them to vote blindly in favor of whichever party they choose, which votes may be discarded anyway. With an uncensored popular vote, the political canidates will be forced to advertise for all of the united states, instead of just the bigger or indevisive states. this will also remove all of the unfair advantages from the larger states, including more information as well as an unfairly weighted voting system.

The creators of this software, Prof. Thomas Huang and Prof. Nicu Sebe are the leading experts of developing better ways for humans and computers to communicate.

As stated in the article by the Office of the Federal Register, \"The Certificate of Ascertainment also declares the winning presidential candidate in your state and shows which electors will represent your state at the meeting of the electors in December of the election year.\" The Electoral College is what mantains everything professional.

Also, candidates would no longer pay special attention to swing states if the electoral college weren't in place so the votes of these citizens wouldn't be held above the rest.

Teachers are guides and resources for students to follow when learning information and asking questions. Frederick Douglass, a slave in the 1800s, became self-educated by looking at other students' papers and reading magazines and books. Although he helped himself become more knowledgable about the world through the new information he obtained, he learned some information wrong because he was not guided or corrected by teachers. Student-designed projects can be precarious because teachers cannot correct students if the project is designed inccorectly. If the project were teacher-designed, then the correct information will be present and learned by the students. The summer projects being flawed can also hurt students. By learning the information incorrectly, they are likely to repeat the same mistakes, making it harder to correct them. In the book  Fish in a Tree , a girl with dyslexia struggled with writing because the words kept moving. She got into the habit of writing letters a specific way so that when a teacher noticed and corrected her, it was hard for her to stop the habit of writing letters incorrectly. Student-designed projects can give students the freedom to express their creativity through learning and designing, but this also allows for students to do their project incorrectly because they learned the material wrong, leading them to repeat the same mistakes because the teacher is not aware of how the students are designing their projects.

The sentences are about Venus' nickname, the \"Evening Star\", and how even though it is a planet, it is still called this. This is completely irrelevant to exploration, as everyone knows it is a planet, and the \"Evening Star\" name is never mentioned again. Later on in the passage, the author rambles on about World War II-age computers and how they functioned properly even before the digital age. Once more, this is slightly irrelevant and does not contribute to the story at all except to add another paragraph instead of focusing on the specifics of how NASA is using them to help with Venus.

People are supposed to be granted the opportunity to elect the president of their choice, not of somebody elses. The most popular vote would take into consideration of every citizen's opinion with a direct percentage of votes to elect a certain candidate. In the article, \"In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President,\" Richard A. Posner states, \"The Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal. No region (South, Northeast, etc.) has enough electoral votes to elect a president.\" This may be true but if the most popular vote system was put into place, there would be an even more exact number of how many people voted for each candidate. The Electoral College does not voice the opinions of all citizens because in reality, a person is not directly voting for their desired candidate. They are voting for other representatives that will hopefully, in turn, elect the candidate they want. Obviously, the Electoral College is definitely a system that should be abolished in the United States of America. ",

It is obvious that the voters only know so much of what they vote for and do not really get a good taste of how the presidential canadidate is like. It can be clear that as a blind election, the voters have no hints of who they might be voting towards and in the end can cause a major catasrophe if a canadidate has very little intentions for the states. In agreement to the article the text  In the defense of the electoral college by Richard A. Posner it begins to sate the election of Romney who, by increasing his plurality and possesing only regional appeal, lost the peoples desire to vote for him thinking that the man has no regards for their interest and does not have any intentions of improving their needs or helping with creating a community where the people can rely on Romney. The actions taken began to change the thoughts of the citizens and create a petrifying conclusion that the man was not on the run to be everyone's president. This dilema could have been changed around if Romney had shown that he had cared more for his state and his country and thought more about the needs he could fill and the actions he could improve, then many of the voters would have most likely shown repsect and a desire for the man to be choosen as their new president. On the opposing hand Romney had not shown any of those qualities or passion which had caused for him to be thought of as unresponisble and selfish.  The country has more than thousands and thousands of people to serve and direct. It can be understood that having a large amount of citizens can result in uncertainty towards the election and the votes cast, yet it is yet to be changed to a more reasonable way of confronting it. With many systems such as \"Winner-Take -All\" due to states titled as the \"Swing States,\" it can be an untrustworthy election fo rmany voters around the country. The election process not only need to be changed to select a more responsible canadidate, but to create a more trustworthy system of itself.  ",

Similarly to the style of projects, upon seeing all of the topics that interest the students, the teachers may be inclined to add some of the topics to their curriculum, which would once again encourage the students to be more interested in their classes.  When one student is interested in something, it is more than likely that other students will be the same.  Though it is important for students to work with topics that are already somewhat familiar to them, it's also very important for students to step outside of their comfort zone into something entirely new.  When a student begins learning about a topic with an open mind and a goal to learn, they may find more than a project, they may find a passion.  It's very important to allow students to explore new interests while still in highschool.  Being in the smae routine for years may put a student into the mindset that they should not change what they are already doing, or it could even discourage students from pursuing new interests.  It is important that students find these interests so that they will have an idea of what they want to do when they go to college, or when they step out into the world as adults. ",

She could have also done many courses herself to not be pushed aside by her family and made fun of for her desire to learn. ",

I understand that under the  Electoral College system,voters vote not for the president but for a slate of electors,who turn elect the president. If you lived in texas for instance and wanted to vote for john kerry you'd vote for a slate of 34 democratic electors pledged to kerry,On the off-chance that those electors won the statewide election they would go to congress and kerry would get 34 lectoral votes. Each candidate running for president in your state has his or her own group of electors. The electors are generally chosen by the candidates,s political party, but state laws vary on how the electors are selected and what their reponsibilities are. At the most basic level the  Electoral College is unfair to voters because of the winner take all system in each state,canidatdes dont spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning.  Election by popular vote for the president of the  United States  Obama received 61.7 percent of the electoral votes compared to only 51.3 percent of the popular votes cast for him and romney becausw almost all states award electoral votes on a winner take all basis even a very slight plurality in a state creates a landslide electoral vote victory in that state. A tie in a nationwide electoral vote is possible because the total number of votes 538 is an even number,but it is highly unlikely but each party selcts a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee it is entirely possible that the winner of the electoral vote will not win the national popular vote. Yet that has happened very rarely. It happened in 2000, when Gore had more popular votes than bush yet fewer electoral votes,but that was the first time since 1888 thats happened. there are five reasons for reraining the electoral college despite its lackof democratic pedigree all practical reasons not liberal or conservative reasons.
